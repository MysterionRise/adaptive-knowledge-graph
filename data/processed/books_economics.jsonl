Simply select the content most relevant to your current semester and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of your class. *Principles of Economics* is organized as a collection of sections that can be rearranged, modified, and enhanced through localized examples or to incorporate a specific theme of your course. This customization feature will ensure that your textbook truly reflects the goals of your course. *Principles of Economics* is also available in two volumes, one covering microeconomics and one covering macroeconomics principles.\n\n#### Curation   {#eip-696}\n\nTo broaden access and encourage community curation, *Principles of Economics* is \u201copen source\u201d licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) license. The economics community is invited to submit examples, emerging research, and other feedback to enhance and strengthen the material and keep it current and relevant for today\u2019s students. You can submit your suggestions to info@openstaxcollege.org.\n\n#### Cost   {#eip-233}\n\nOur textbooks are available for free online, and in low-cost print and e-book editions.\n\n### About *Principles of Economics*   {#eip-307}\n\n*Principles of Economics* is designed for a two-semester principles of economics sequence. The text has been developed to meet the scope and sequence of most introductory courses. At the same time, the book includes a number of innovative features designed to enhance student learning. Instructors can also customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.\n\n#### Coverage and Scope   {#eip-887}\n\nTo develop *Principles of Economics*, we acquired the rights to Timothy Taylor\u2019s second edition of Principles of Economics and solicited ideas from economics instructors at all levels of higher education, from community colleges to Ph.D.-granting universities. They told us about their courses, students, challenges, resources, and how a textbook can best meet the needs of both instructors and students.\n\nThe result is a book that covers the breadth of economics topics and also provides the necessary depth to ensure the course is manageable for instructors and students alike. And to make it more applied, we have incorporated many current topics. We hope students will be interested to know just how far-reaching the recent recession was (and still is), for example, and why there is so much controversy even among economists over the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). The Keystone Pipeline, Occupy Wall Street, minimum wage debates, and the appointment of the United States\u2019 first female Federal Reserve chair, Janet Yellen, are just a few of the other important topics covered.\n\nThe pedagogical choices, chapter arrangements, and learning objective fulfillment were developed and vetted with feedback from educators dedicated to the project. They thoroughly read the material and offered critical and detailed commentary. The outcome is a balanced approach to micro and macro economics, to both Keynesian and classical views, and to the theory and application of economics concepts. New 2015 data are incorporated for topics that range from average U.S. household consumption in Chapter 2 to the total value of all home equity in Chapter 17. Current events are treated in a politically-balanced way as well.\n\nThe book is organized into eight main parts:\n\n* **What is Economics?** The first two chapters introduce students to the study of economics with a focus on making choices in a world of scarce resources.\n* **Supply and Demand**, Chapters 3 and 4, introduces and explains the first analytical model in economics: supply, demand, and equilibrium, before showing applications in the markets for labor and finance.\n* **The Fundamentals of Microeconomic Theory**, Chapters 5 through 10, begins the microeconomics portion of the text, presenting the theories of consumer behavior, production and costs, and the different models of market structure, including some simple game theory.\n* **Microeconomic Policy Issues**, Chapters 11 through 18, cover the range of topics in applied micro, framed around the concepts of public goods and positive and negative externalities. Students explore competition and antitrust policies, environmental problems, poverty, income inequality, and other labor market issues. The text also covers information, risk and financial markets, as well as public economy.\n* **The Macroeconomic Perspective and Goals**, Chapters 19 through 23, introduces a number of key concepts in macro: economic growth, unemployment and inflation, and international trade and capital flows.\n* **A Framework for Macroeconomic Analysis**, Chapters 24 through 26, introduces the principal analytic model in macro, namely the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model. The model is then applied to the Keynesian and Neoclassical perspectives. The Expenditure-Output model is fully explained in a stand-alone appendix.\n* **Monetary and Fiscal Policy**, Chapters 27 through 31, explains the role of money and the banking system, as well as monetary policy and financial regulation. Then the discussion switches to government deficits and fiscal policy.\n* **International Economics**, Chapters 32 through 34, the final part of the text, introduces the international dimensions of economics, including international trade and protectionism.\n\nChapter 1 Welcome to Economics!* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 2 Choice in a World of Scarcity* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 3 Demand and Supply* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 4 Labor and Financial Markets* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 5 Elasticity* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 6 Consumer Choices* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 7 Cost and Industry Structure* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 8 Perfect Competition* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 9 Monopoly* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 10 Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 11 Monopoly and Antitrust Policy* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 12 Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 13 Positive Externalities and Public Goods* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 14 Poverty and Economic Inequality* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 15 Issues in Labor Markets: Unions, Discrimination, Immigration* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 16 Information, Risk, and Insurance* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 17 Financial Markets* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 18 Public Economy* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 19 The Macroeconomic Perspective* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 20 Economic Growth* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 21 Unemployment* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 22 Inflation* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 23 The International Trade and Capital Flows* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 24 The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 25 The Keynesian Perspective* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 26 The Neoclassical Perspective* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 27 Money and Banking* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 28 Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 29 Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 30 Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 31 The Impacts of Government Borrowing* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 32 Macroeconomic Policy Around the World* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 33 International Trade* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Chapter 34 Globalization and Protectionism* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n * * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Appendix A The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Appendix B Indifference Curves* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Appendix C Present Discounted Value* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Appendix D The Expenditure-Output Model* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n<span data-type=\"title\">Alternate Sequencing </span>*Principles of Economics* was conceived and written to fit a particular topical sequence, but it can be used flexibly to accommodate other course structures.

Our features include:\n\n* **Bring It Home:** This added feature is a brief case study, specific to each chapter, which connects the chapter\u2019s main topic to the real word. It is broken up into two parts: the first at the beginning of the chapter (in the Intro module) and the second at chapter\u2019s end, when students have learned what\u2019s necessary to understand the case and \u201cbring home\u201d the chapter\u2019s core concepts.\n* **Work It Out:** This added feature asks students to work through a generally analytical or computational problem, and guides them step-by-step to find out how its solution is derived.\n* **Clear It Up:** This boxed feature, which includes pre-existing features from Taylor\u2019s text, addresses common student misconceptions about the content. Clear It Ups are usually deeper explanations of something in the main body of the text. Each CIU starts with a question. The rest of the feature explains the answer.\n* **Link It Up:** This added feature is a very brief introduction to a website that is pertinent to students\u2019 understanding and enjoyment of the topic at hand.\n\n#### Questions for Each Level of Learning   {#eip-651}\n\nThe OpenStax version of *Principles of Economics* further expands on Taylor\u2019s original end of chapter materials by offering four types of end-of-module questions for students.\n\n* **Self-Checks:** Are analytical self-assessment questions that appear at the end of each module. They \u201cclick\u2013to-reveal\u201d an answer in the web view so students can check their understanding before moving on to the next module. Self-Check questions are not simple look-up questions. They push the student to think a bit beyond what is said in the text. Self-Check questions are designed for formative (rather than summative) assessment. The questions and answers are explained so that students feel like they are being walked through the problem.\n* **Review Questions:** Have been retained from Taylor\u2019s version, and are simple recall questions from the chapter and are in open-response format (not multiple choice or true/false). The answers can be looked up in the text.\n* **Critical Thinking Questions:** Are new higher-level, conceptual questions that ask students to *demonstrate their understanding by applying* what they have learned in different contexts. They ask for outside-the-box thinking, for *reasoning* about the concepts. They push the student to places they wouldn\u2019t have thought of going themselves.\n* **Problems:** Are exercises that give students additional practice working with the analytic and computational concepts in the module.\n\n#### Updated Art   {#eip-780}\n\n*Principles of Economics* includes an updated art program to better inform today\u2019s student, providing the latest data on covered topics.\n\n&#10;\"){: #eip-id1164834349372 data-title=\"U.S. Minimum Wage and Inflation \"}\n\n### About Our Team   {#eip-660}\n\n#### Senior Contributing Author    {#eip-407}\n\nTimothy Taylor, Macalester College* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n Timothy Taylor has been writing and teaching about economics for 30 years, and is the Managing Editor of the *Journal of Economic Perspectives*, a post he\u2019s held since 1986.

Every day we are faced with a myriad of decisions, from what to have for breakfast, to which route to take to class, to the more complex\u2014\u201cShould I double major and add possibly another semester of study to my education?\u201d Our response to these choices depends on the information we have available at any given moment; information economists call \u201cimperfect\u201d because we rarely have all the data we need to make perfect decisions. Despite the lack of perfect information, we still make hundreds of decisions a day.\n\nAnd now, we have another avenue in which to gather information\u2014social media. Outlets like Facebook and Twitter are altering the process by which we make choices, how we spend our time, which movies we see, which products we buy, and more. How many of you chose a university without checking out its Facebook page or Twitter stream first for information and feedback?\n\nAs you will see in this course, what happens in economics is affected by how well and how fast information is disseminated through a society, such as how quickly information travels through Facebook. \u201cEconomists love nothing better than when deep and liquid markets operate under conditions of perfect information,\u201d says Jessica Irvine, National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.\n\nThis leads us to the topic of this chapter, an introduction to the world of making decisions, processing information, and understanding behavior in markets \u2014the world of economics.

These can be individual decisions, family decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact of life. **Scarcity**{: data-type=\"term\"} means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time- everyone, rich or poor, has just 24 hours in the day to try to acquire the goods they want. At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of resources available.\n\nThink about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158.6 million workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Similarly, the total area of the United States is 3,794,101 square miles. These are large numbers for such crucial resources, however, they are limited. Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C01_003 data-title=\"Scarcity of Resources\"}\n\nIf you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following: Does everyone need food to eat? Does everyone need a decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the world, there are people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their beds, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C01_003)), and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the case? It is because of scarcity. Let\u2019s delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to understanding economics.\n\n### The Problem of Scarcity\n\nThink about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How do you acquire those items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the things you buy? You work for pay. Or if you do not, someone else does on your behalf. Yet most of us never have enough to buy all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it?\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read about how the United States is dealing with scarcity in resources.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nEvery society, at every level, must make choices about how to use its resources. Families must decide whether to spend their money on a new car or a fancy vacation. Towns must choose whether to put more of the budget into police and fire protection or into the school system. Nations must decide whether to devote more funds to national defense or to protecting the environment. In most cases, there just isn\u2019t enough money in the budget to do everything. So why do we not each just produce all of the things we consume? The simple answer is most of us do not know how, but that is not the main reason. (When you study economics, you will discover that the obvious choice is not always the right answer\u2014or at least the complete answer. Studying economics teaches you to think in a different of way.) Think back to pioneer days, when individuals knew how to do so much more than we do today, from building their homes, to growing their crops, to hunting for food, to repairing their equipment. Most of us do not know how to do all\u2014or any\u2014of those things. It is not because we could not learn. Rather, we do not have to. The reason why is something called *the division and specialization of labor*, a production innovation first put forth by **Adam Smith**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C01_008), in his book, *The Wealth of Nations*.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C01_008 data-title=\"Adam Smith\"}\n\n### The Division of and Specialization of Labor\n\nThe formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723\u20131790) published his famous book *The Wealth of Nations* in 1776. Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the **division of labor**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers, instead of all the tasks being done by the same person.\n\nTo illustrate the division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that were often done by different people\u2014all for a pin, believe it or not!\n\nModern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides up the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills\u2014not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C01_009), or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C01_009 data-title=\"Division of Labor\"}\n\n### Why the Division of Labor Increases Production\n\nWhen the tasks involved with producing a good or service are divided and subdivided, workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith observed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to do two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons.\n\nFirst, **specialization**{: data-type=\"term\"} in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing **comparative advantage**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, specialization will be affected by geography\u2014it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will be more productive than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of which they are not.\n\nSecond, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better.\n\nA similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its \u201c**core competency**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\u201d) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products.\n\nThird, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of **economies of scale**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of their own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity.\n\n### Trade and Markets\n\nSpecialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services that they need. In short, specialization requires trade.\n\nYou do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music\u2014you just buy an iPod or MP3 player, download the music and listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket\u2014you just buy the jacket and wear it. You do not need to know anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car\u2014you just get in and drive. Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the goods and services you need or want. This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy.\n\n### Why Study Economics?\n\nNow that we have gotten an overview on what economics studies, let\u2019s quickly discuss why you are right to study it. Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to be memorized, though there are plenty of important concepts to be learned. Instead, economics is better thought of as a collection of questions to be answered or puzzles to be worked out. Most important, economics provides the tools to work out those puzzles. If you have yet to be been bitten by the economics \u201cbug,\u201d there are other reasons why you should study economics.\n\n* Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to world poverty, to the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part of solving those problems, you need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial.\n* It is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able to vote intelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came close to a standstill at the end of 2012 due to the \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d what were the issues involved? Did you know?\n* A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you read articles about economic issues, you will understand and be able to evaluate the writer\u2019s argument. When you hear classmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish between common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events and about personal and business decisions, as well as current events and politics.\n\nThe study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can illuminate the different choices.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nEconomics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a) It allows the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b) It encourages the agents to learn and invent; c) It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps you become a well-rounded thinker.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is scarcity? Can you think of two causes of scarcity?\n\n\n\nScarcity means human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. Supply is limited because resources are limited. Demand, however, is virtually unlimited. Whatever the supply, it seems human nature to want more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResidents of the town of Smithfield like to consume hams, but each ham requires 10 people to produce it and takes a month. If the town has a total of 100 people, what is the maximum amount of ham the residents can consume in a month?\n\n\n\n100 people / 10 people per ham = a maximum of 10 hams per month if all residents produce ham. Since consumption is limited by production, the maximum number of hams residents could consume per month is 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA consultant works for $200 per hour. She likes to eat vegetables, but is not very good at growing them. Why does it make more economic sense for her to spend her time at the consulting job and shop for her vegetables?\n\n\n\nShe is very productive at her consulting job, but not very productive growing vegetables. Time spent consulting would produce far more income than it what she could save growing her vegetables using the same amount of time. So on purely economic grounds, it makes more sense for her to maximize her income by applying her labor to what she does best (i.e. specialization of labor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA computer systems engineer could paint his house, but it makes more sense for him to hire a painter to do it. Explain why.\n\n\n\nThe engineer is better at computer science than at painting. Thus, his time is better spent working for pay at his job and paying a painter to paint his house. Of course, this assumes he does not paint his house for fun!\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nGive the three reasons that explain why the division of labor increases an economy\u2019s level of production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are three reasons to study economics?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nSuppose you have a team of two workers: one is a baker and one is a chef. Explain why the kitchen can produce more meals in a given period of time if each worker specializes in what they do best than if each worker tries to do everything from appetizer to dessert.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy would division of labor without trade not work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you think of any examples of *free* goods, that is, goods or services that are not scarce?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. 2015. \\\"The Employment Situation\u2014February 2015.\\\" Accessed March 27, 2015. http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf.\n\nWilliamson, Lisa. \u201cUS Labor Market in 2012.\u201d *Bureau of Labor Statistics*.

Economics acknowledges that production of useful goods and services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the question of how investing in education helps to develop workers\u2019 skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses or big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way that benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions about production and consumption.\n\nIt should be clear by now that economics covers a lot of ground. That ground can be divided into two parts: **Microeconomics**{: data-type=\"term\"} focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and businesses; **Macroeconomics**{: data-type=\"term\"} looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects, but rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the economy.\n\nTo understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the entire ecosystem of the lake from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has a different viewpoint.\n\nWhether you are looking at lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each other. In studying a lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals help to understand the overall food chain, while the macro insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which individual plants and animals live.\n\nIn economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy; for example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn, the performance of the macroeconomy ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions made by individual households and businesses.\n\n### Microeconomics \n\nWhat determines how households and individuals spend their budgets? What combination of goods and services will best fit their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How do people decide whether to work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save for the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond their current means?\n\nWhat determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell? What determines what prices a firm will charge? What determines how a firm will produce its products? What determines how many workers it will hire? How will a firm finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even close? In the microeconomic part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior and the theory of the firm.\n\n### Macroeconomics\n\nWhat determines the level of economic activity in a society? In other words, what determines how many goods and services a nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are available in an economy? What determines a nation\u2019s standard of living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What causes firms to hire more workers or to lay workers off? Finally, what causes the economy to grow over the long term?\n\nAn economy\\'s macroeconomic health can be defined by a number of goals: growth in the standard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to name the most important. How can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals? **Monetary policy**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which involves policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets, is conducted by a nation\u2019s central bank. For the United States, this is the Federal Reserve. **Fiscal policy**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which involves government spending and taxes, is determined by a nation\u2019s legislative body. For the United States, this is the Congress and the executive branch, which originates the federal budget. These are the main tools the government has to work with. Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that expectation realistic? These are just some of the issues that will be explored in the macroeconomic chapters of this book.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nMicroeconomics and macroeconomics are two different perspectives on the economy. The microeconomic perspective focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and industries. The macroeconomic perspective looks at the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living, unemployment, and inflation. Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these goals: monetary policy and fiscal policy.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhat would be another example of a \u201csystem\u201d in the real world that could serve as a metaphor for micro and macroeconomics?\n\n\n\nThere are many physical systems that would work, for example, the study of planets (micro) in the solar system (macro), or solar systems (micro) in the galaxy (macro).\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are examples of individual economic agents?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the three main goals of macroeconomics?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nA balanced federal budget and a balance of trade are considered secondary goals of macroeconomics, while growth in the standard of living (for example) is considered a primary goal. Why do you think that is so?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMacroeconomics is an aggregate of what happens at the microeconomic level. Would it be possible for what happens at the macro level to differ from how economic agents would react to some stimulus at the micro level? <em>Hint: </em>Think about the behavior of crowds.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nfiscal policy\n: economic policies that involve government spending and taxes\n^\n\nmacroeconomics\n: the branch of economics that focuses on broad issues such as growth, unemployment, inflation, and trade balance.\n^\n\nmicroeconomics\n: the branch of economics that focuses on actions of particular agents within the economy, like households, workers, and business firms\n^\n\nmonetary policy\n: policy that involves altering the level of interest rates, the availability of credit in the economy, and the extent of borrowing", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

Keynes, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C01_004), famously wrote in the introduction to a fellow economist\u2019s book: \u201c\\[Economics\\] is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking, which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions.\u201d In other words, economics teaches you how to think, not what to think.\n\n\nWatch this [video][1] about John Maynard Keynes and his influence on economics.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nEconomists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or practitioners of any other discipline. They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior, that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use. A **theory**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other. The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around it. A good theory is simple enough to be understood, while complex enough to capture the key features of the object or situation being studied.\n\nSometimes economists use the term **model**{: data-type=\"term\"} instead of theory. Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract representation, while a model is more applied or empirical representation. Models are used to test theories, but for this course we will use the terms interchangeably.\n\nFor example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on a tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often build models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product will be, but can still demonstrate how the new product will work.\n\nA good model to start with in economics is the **circular flow diagram**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C01_002). It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups\u2014households and firms\u2014that interact in two markets: the **goods and services market**{: data-type=\"term\"} in which firms sell and households buy and the **labor market**{: data-type=\"term\"} in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C01_002 data-title=\"The Circular Flow Diagram\"}\n\nOf course, in the real world, there are many different markets for goods and services and markets for many different types of labor. The circular flow diagram simplifies this to make the picture easier to grasp. In the diagram, firms produce goods and services, which they sell to households in return for revenues. This is shown in the outer circle, and represents the two sides of the product market (for example, the market for goods and services) in which households demand and firms supply. Households sell their labor as workers to firms in return for wages, salaries and benefits. This is shown in the inner circle and represents the two sides of the labor market in which households supply and firms demand.\n\nThis version of the circular flow model is stripped down to the essentials, but it has enough features to explain how the product and labor markets work in the economy. We could easily add details to this basic model if we wanted to introduce more real-world elements, like financial markets, governments, and interactions with the rest of the globe (imports and exports).\n\nEconomists carry a set of theories in their heads like a carpenter carries around a toolkit. When they see an economic issue or problem, they go through the theories they know to see if they can find one that fits. Then they use the theory to derive insights about the issue or problem. In economics, theories are expressed as diagrams, graphs, or even as mathematical equations. (Do not worry. In this course, we will mostly use graphs.) Economists do not figure out the answer to the problem first and then draw the graph to illustrate. Rather, they use the graph of the theory to help them figure out the answer. Although at the introductory level, you can sometimes figure out the right answer without applying a model, if you keep studying economics, before too long you will run into issues and problems that you will need to graph to solve. Both micro and macroeconomics are explained in terms of theories and models. The most well-known theories are probably those of supply and demand, but you will learn a number of others.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nEconomists analyze problems differently than do other disciplinary experts. The main tools economists use are economic theories or models. A theory is not an illustration of the answer to a problem. Rather, a theory is a tool for determining the answer.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nSuppose we extend the circular flow model to add imports and exports. Copy the circular flow diagram onto a sheet of paper and then add a foreign country as a third agent. Draw a rough sketch of the flows of imports, exports, and the payments for each on your diagram.\n\n\n\nDraw a box outside the original circular flow to represent the foreign country. Draw an arrow from the foreign country to firms, to represents imports. Draw an arrow in the reverse direction representing payments for imports. Draw an arrow from firms to the foreign country to represent exports. Draw an arrow in the reverse direction to represent payments for imports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an example of a problem in the world today, not mentioned in the chapter, that has an economic dimension?\n\n\n\nThere are many such problems. Consider the AIDS epidemic. Why are so few AIDS patients in Africa and Southeast Asia treated with the same drugs that are effective in the United States and Europe? It is because neither those patients nor the countries in which they live have the resources to purchase the same drugs.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nHow did John Maynard Keynes define economics?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre households primarily buyers or sellers in the goods and services market? In the labor market?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre firms primarily buyers or sellers in the goods and services market? In the labor market?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhy is it unfair or meaningless to criticize a theory as \u201cunrealistic?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose, as an economist, you are asked to analyze an issue unlike anything you have ever done before.

It includes all production of goods and services, all buying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who organizes and coordinates this system? Who insures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the same as the amount it needs and wants? Who insures that the right number of employees work in the electronics industry? Who insures that televisions are produced in the best way possible? How does it all get done?\n\nThere are at least three ways societies have found to organize an economy. The first is the **traditional economy**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is the oldest economic system and can be found in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family. Most families are farmers who grow the crops they have always grown using traditional methods. What you produce is what you get to consume. Because things are driven by tradition, there is little economic progress or development.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C01_005 data-title=\"A Command Economy\"}\n\nCommand economies are very different. In a **command economy**{: data-type=\"term\"}, economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids, like those shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C01_005), for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another example: the lord provided the land for growing crops and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor and soldiers to do the lord\u2019s bidding. In the last century, communism emphasized command economies.\n\nIn a command economy, the government decides what goods and services will be produced and what prices will be charged for them. The government decides what methods of production will be used and how much workers will be paid. Many necessities like healthcare and education are provided for free. Currently, Cuba and North Korea have command economies.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C01_006 data-title=\"A Market Economy\"}\n\nAlthough command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies have a very decentralized structure. A **market**{: data-type=\"term\"} is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C01_006), is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together. In a **market economy**{: data-type=\"term\"}, decision-making is decentralized. Market economies are based on **private enterprise**{: data-type=\"term\"}\\: the means of production (resources and businesses) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals. Businesses supply goods and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by contrast, resources and businesses are owned by the government.) What goods and services are supplied depends on what is demanded. A person\u2019s income is based on his or her ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something that society values. The more society values the person\u2019s output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James). In this scenario, economic decisions are determined by market forces, not governments.\n\nMost economies in the real world are mixed; they combine elements of command and market (and even traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions than does the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while they are closer to having a market-oriented system now than several decades ago, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum. A rich resource of information about countries and their economies can be found on the Heritage Foundation\u2019s website, as the following Clear It Up feature discusses.\n\n\n\nWhat countries are considered economically free?\n\nWho is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want? Are businesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are banks free to choose who will receive loans? Or does the government control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the *Wall Street Journal* look at 50 different categories of economic freedom for countries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each category.\n\nThe 2015 Heritage Foundation\u2019s Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world: some examples of the most free and the least free countries are listed in [\\[link\\]](#Table_01_01). Several countries were not ranked because of extreme instability that made judgments about economic freedom impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Somalia.\n\nThe assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful for discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although 77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall trend has been a *higher level of economic freedom around the world*.\n\n<table id=\"Table_01_01\" summary=\"This table has two columns and ten rows.

There is no such thing as an absolutely free market. Regulations always define the \u201crules of the game\u201d in the economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented have fewer regulations\u2014ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? But the decisions of what will be produced and what prices will be charged are heavily regulated. Heavily regulated economies often have **underground economies**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government\u2019s approval.\n\nThe question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a black-or-white choice between all market or all government, but instead involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market freedom and government rules.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C01_007 data-title=\"Globalization\"}\n\n### The Rise of Globalization\n\nRecent decades have seen a trend toward **globalization**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is the expanding cultural, political, and economic connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders\u2014in other words, international trade and financial capital flows.\n\nGlobalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C01_007), and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations in computing and telecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of information\u2014for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged greater trade.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_01_02) presents one measure of globalization. It shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2013, according to an entity known as The World Bank. **Exports**{: data-type=\"term\"} are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad. **Imports**{: data-type=\"term\"} are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically. The size of total production in an economy is measured by the **gross domestic product (GDP)**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country\u2019s total economic production is sold in other countries.\n\n<table id=\"Table_01_02\" summary=\" This table has five columns and fifteen rows.

Interestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in part because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their national borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_01_02) also shows that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special glasses that make all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the astronaut would see the planet covered with connections.\n\nSo, hopefully, you now have an idea of what economics is about. Before you move to any other chapter of study, be sure to read the very important appendix to this chapter called [The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics](/m48831). It is essential that you learn more about how to read and use models in economics.\n\n\n\nDecisions ... Decisions in the Social Media Age\n\nThe world we live in today provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the Farmer\u2019s Almanac, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their crops. Today, farmers are more likely to access, online, weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or watch the Weather Channel. After all, knowing the upcoming forecast could drive when to harvest crops. Consequently, knowing the upcoming weather could change the amount of crop harvested.\n\nSome relatively new information forums, such as Facebook, are rapidly changing how information is distributed; hence, influencing decision making. In 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that 71% of online adults use Facebook. Facebook post topics range from the National Basketball Association, to celebrity singers and performers, to farmers.\n\nInformation helps us make decisions. Decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters should be sent to cover a crash. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If ten reporters are sent to cover an accident, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks. Information provides the knowledge needed to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize scarce resources. Welcome to the world of economics!\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nSocieties can be organized as traditional, command, or market-oriented economies. Most societies are a mix. The last few decades have seen globalization evolve as a result of growth in commercial and financial networks that cross national borders, making businesses and workers from different economies increasingly interdependent.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nThe chapter defines *private enterprise* as a characteristic of market-oriented economies. What would *public enterprise* be? *Hint*: It is a characteristic of command economies.\n\n\n\nPublic enterprise means the factors of production (resources and businesses) are owned and operated by the government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might Belgium, France, Italy, and Sweden have a higher export to GDP ratio than the United States?\n\n\n\nThe United States is a large country economically speaking, so it has less need to trade internationally than the other countries mentioned. (This is the same reason that France and Italy have lower ratios than Belgium or Sweden.) One additional reason is that each of the other countries is a member of the European Union, where trade between members occurs without barriers to trade, like tariffs and quotas.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are the three ways that societies can organize themselves economically?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is globalization? How do you think it might have affected the economy over the past decade?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhy do you think that most modern countries\u2019 economies are a mix of command and market types?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you think of ways that globalization has helped you economically? Can you think of ways that it has not?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nThe Heritage Foundation. 2015. \\\"2015 Index of Economic Freedom.\\\" Accessed March 11, 2015. http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking.\n\nGarling, Caleb. \u201cS.F. plane crash: Reporting, emotions on social media,\u201d *The San Francisco Chronicle*.

To What Degree?\n\nIn 2015, the median income for workers who hold master\\'s degrees varies from males to females. The average of the two is $2,951 weekly. Multiply this average by 52 weeks, and you get an average salary of $153,452. Compare that to the median weekly earnings for a full-time worker over 25 with no higher than a bachelor\u2019s degree: $1,224 weekly and $63,648 a year. What about those with no higher than a high school diploma in 2015? They earn just $664 weekly and $34,528 over 12 months. In other words, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), earning a bachelor\u2019s degree boosted salaries 54% over what you would have earned if you had stopped your education after high school. A master\u2019s degree yields a salary almost double that of a high school diploma.\n\nGiven these statistics, we might expect a lot of people to choose to go to college and at least earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. Assuming that people want to improve their material well-being, it seems like they would make those choices that give them the greatest opportunity to consume goods and services. As it turns out, the analysis is not nearly as simple as this. In fact, in 2014, the BLS reported that while almost 88% of the population in the United States had a high school diploma, only 33.6% of 25\u201365 year olds had bachelor\u2019s degrees, and only 7.4% of 25\u201365 year olds in 2014 had earned a master\u2019s.\n\nThis brings us to the subject of this chapter: why people make the choices they make and how economists go about explaining those choices.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Choice in a World of Scarcity\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint\n* The Production Possibilities Frontier and Social Choices\n* Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach\n\n\n\nYou will learn quickly when you examine the relationship between economics and scarcity that choices involve tradeoffs. Every choice has a cost.\n\nIn 1968, the Rolling Stones recorded \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want.\u201d Economists chuckled, because they had been singing a similar tune for decades. English economist Lionel Robbins (1898\u20131984), in his *Essay on the Nature and Significance of Economic Science* in 1932, described not always getting what you want in this way:\n\n<q>The time at our disposal is limited. There are only twenty-four hours in the day. We have to choose between the different uses to which they may be put. ... Everywhere we turn, if we choose one thing we must relinquish others which, in different circumstances, we would wish not to have relinquished. Scarcity of means to satisfy given ends is an almost ubiquitous condition of human nature.</q>\n\nBecause people live in a world of scarcity, they cannot have all the time, money, possessions, and experiences they wish. Neither can society.\n\nThis chapter will continue our discussion of scarcity and the economic way of thinking by first introducing three critical concepts: opportunity cost, marginal decision making, and diminishing returns. Later, it will consider whether the economic way of thinking accurately describes either how choices *are* made or how they *should* be made.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48605", "module_title": "Economics - m48605", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48605", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Calculate and graph budgets constraints\n* Explain opportunity sets and opportunity costs\n* Evaluate the law of diminishing marginal utility\n* Explain how marginal analysis and utility influence choices\n\n\n\nConsider the typical consumer\u2019s budget problem. Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate between bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus tickets are 50 cents each. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C02_001) shows Alphonso\u2019s **budget constraint**{: data-type=\"term\"}, that is, the outer boundary of his **opportunity set**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The opportunity set identifies all the opportunities for spending within his budget. The budget constraint indicates all the combinations of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford when he exhausts his budget, given the prices of the two goods. (There are actually many different kinds of budget constraints. You will learn more about them in the chapter on [Consumer Choices](/m48640){: .target-chapter}.)\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C02_001 data-title=\"The Budget Constraint: Alphonso&#x2019;s Consumption Choice Opportunity Frontier \"}\n\nThe vertical axis in the figure shows burger purchases and the horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If Alphonso spends all his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2 per burger = 5 burgers per week.) But if he does this, he will not be able to afford any bus tickets. This choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers) is shown by point A in the figure. Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus tickets, he can afford 20 per week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then, however, he will not be able to afford any burgers. This alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero burgers) is shown by point F.\n\nIf Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers. That is, he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that connects points A and F. Every point on (or inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any point outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his budget.\n\nThe budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets. Suppose he is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would it cost Alphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to answer $2, but that\u2019s not the way economists think. Instead they ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying within his budget? The answer is four bus tickets. That is the true cost to Alphonso of one more burger.\n\n### The Concept of Opportunity Cost\n\nEconomists use the term **opportunity cost**{: data-type=\"term\"} to indicate what must be given up to obtain something that is desired. The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else; in short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the opportunity cost of a burger is the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to choose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone alternative\u2014in this case, bus tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they have to give up things they desire to get other things they desire more.\n\n\nView this [website][1] for an example of opportunity cost\u2014paying someone else to wait in line for you.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nA fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost. If you sleep through your economics class (not recommended, by the way), the opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If you spend your income on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\n\nThe following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis of a budget constraint calculation. Read through it to understand another important concept\u2014slope\u2014that is further explained in the appendix [The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics](/m48831).\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Budget Constraints\n\nBudget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math. The appendix [The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics](/m48831) explains all the math you are likely to need in this book. So if math is not your strength, you might want to take a look at the appendix.\n\nStep 1: The equation for any budget constraint is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Budget</mtext><mo>=</mo><msub><mtext>P</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mtext>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Q</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mtext>\u00a0+\u00a0P</mtext><mrow><mn>2</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\" /></mrow></msub><msub><mtext>\u00d7\u00a0Q</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></math>\n\nwhere P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased and Budget is the amount of income one has to spend.\n\nStep 2. Apply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In Alphonso\u2019s case, this works out to be:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Budget</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd> <mtd><msub><mtext>P</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mtext> \u00d7 Q</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mtext> + P</mtext><mrow><mn>2</mn><mspace width=\"0.2em\" /></mrow></msub><msub><mtext>\u00d7 Q</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub> </mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>$10\u00a0budget</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>$2\u00a0per\u00a0burger\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0quantity\u00a0of\u00a0burgers\u00a0+\u00a0$0.50\u00a0per\u00a0bus\u00a0ticket\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0quantity\u00a0of\u00a0bus\u00a0tickets</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>$10</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><msub><mtext>$2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Q</mtext><mtext>burgers</mtext></msub><msub><mtext>\u00a0+\u00a0$0.50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Q</mtext><mtext>bus\u00a0tickets</mtext></msub></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 3. Using a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar equation of a line:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px 2px\" columnalign=\"right center\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>y</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>b\u00a0+\u00a0mx</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nFor Alphonso, this is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>$10</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><msub><mtext>$2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Q</mtext><mrow><mtext>burgers</mtext></mrow></msub><mtext>\u00a0+\u00a0</mtext><mtext>$0.50</mtext><mtext>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0</mtext><msub><mtext>Q</mtext><mtext>bus\u00a0tickets</mtext></msub></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 4.

Subtract one bus ticket from both sides:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><msub><mtext>20 \u2013 Q</mtext><mtext>bus tickets</mtext></msub></mtd><mtd><mtext> = </mtext></mtd><mtd><msub><mtext>4 \u00d7 Q</mtext><mtext>burgers</mtext></msub></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nDivide each side by 4 to yield the answer:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><msub><mtext>5 \u2013 0.25 \u00d7 Q</mtext><mtext>bus tickets</mtext></msub></mtd><mtd><mtext> = </mtext></mtd><mtd><msub><mtext>Q</mtext><mtext>burgers</mtext></msub></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>or</mtext></mtd><mtd /></mtr><mtr><mtd><msub><mtext>Q</mtext><mtext>burgers</mtext></msub></mtd><mtd><mtext> = </mtext></mtd><mtd><msub><mtext>5 \u2013 0.25 \u00d7 Q</mtext><mtext>bus tickets</mtext></msub></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 6. Notice that this equation fits the budget constraint in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C02_001). The vertical intercept is 5 and the slope is \u20130.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the equation, you get 0 burgers. If you plug other numbers of bus tickets into the equation, you get the results shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_02_01), which are the points on Alphonso\u2019s budget constraint.\n\n<table id=\"Table_02_01\" summary=\"Table lists points A through F in column 1. Column 2 lists the quantity of burgers (at $2), and column 3 lists the quantity of bus tickets (at 50 cents). Point A has 5 burgers, 0 bus tickets. Point B has 4 burgers, 4 bus tickets. Point C has 3 burgers, 8 bus tickets. Point D has 2 burgers, 12 bus tickets. Point E has 1 burger, 16 bus tickets. Point F has 0 burgers, 20 bus tickets.\"><caption /><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Point</th>\n<th>Quantity of Burgers (at $2)</th>\n<th>Quantity of Bus Tickets (at 50 cents)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>B</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>D</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>E</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>F</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\nStep 7. Notice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the opportunity cost of the good which is on the horizontal axis. For Alphonso, the slope is \u22120.25, indicating that for every four bus tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1 burger.\n\nThere are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of the slope is negative, which means that the only way to get more of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, the slope is defined as the price of bus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on the vertical axis), in this case $0.50/$2 = 0.25. So if you want to determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the two prices.\n\n\n\n### Identifying Opportunity Cost\n\nIn many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the **price**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for $300, then $300 measures the amount of \u201cother consumption\u201d that he has given up. For practical purposes, there may be no special need to identify the specific alternative product or products that could have been bought with that $300, but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true opportunity cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are involved.\n\nFor example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to \u201cbuild team spirit.\u201d The out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the retreat, as well as room and board for all participants. But an opportunity cost exists as well: during the two days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any other work.\n\nAttending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket costs of attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. But in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus, college imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.\n\n\n\nWhat is the opportunity cost associated with increased airport security measures?\n\nAfter the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air travel safety. For example, the federal government could provide armed \u201csky marshals\u201d who would travel inconspicuously with the rest of the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per year. Retrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harder for terrorists to take over the plane would have a price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment for airports, like three-dimensional baggage scanners and cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2 billion.\n\nBut the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the opportunity cost of additional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), more than 800 million passengers took plane trips in the United States in 2012. Since the 9/11 hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than in the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists commonly place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air travelers are relatively high-paid business people, conservative estimates set the average price of time for air travelers at $20 per hour. By these back-of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in airports could be as much as 800 million \u00d7 0.5 hours \u00d7 $20/hour, or $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of waiting time can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on lunch every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a day, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs minus the $3 your lunch from home would cost). $5 each day does not seem to be that much. However, if you project what that adds up to in a year\u2014250 days a year \u00d7 $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost, perhaps, of a decent vacation. If the opportunity cost is described as \u201ca nice vacation\u201d instead of \u201c$5 a day,\u201d you might make different choices.\n\n### Marginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility\n\nThe budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting all of one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the budget constraint or else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices involve **marginal analysis**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which means comparing the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good.\n\nPeople desire goods and services for the satisfaction or **utility**{: data-type=\"term\"} those goods and services provide. Utility, as we will see in the chapter on [Consumer Choices](/m48640){: .target-chapter}, is subjective but that does not make it less real. Economists typically assume that the more of some good one consumes (for example, slices of pizza), the more utility one obtains. At the same time, the utility a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more than the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good. When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus tickets, for example, the first few bus rides that he chooses might provide him with a great deal of utility\u2014perhaps they help him get to a job interview or a doctor\u2019s appointment. But later bus rides might provide much less utility\u2014they may only serve to kill time on a rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy may be on a day when he missed breakfast and is ravenously hungry. However, if Alphonso has a burger every single day, the last few burgers may taste pretty boring. The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern. Economists refer to this pattern as the **law of diminishing marginal utility**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which means that as a person receives more of a good, the additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. In other words, the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.\n\nThe law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices. You would not say, \u201cMy favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now on.\u201d Instead, even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or marginal utility from those last few servings would not be very high. Similarly, most workers do not say: \u201cI enjoy leisure, so I\u2019ll never work.\u201d Instead, workers recognize that even though some leisure is very nice, a combination of all leisure and no income is not so attractive. The budget constraint framework suggests that when people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and think about whether they would prefer a little more or a little less.\n\n### Sunk Costs\n\nIn the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will happen next: that is, what quantities of goods will you consume, how many hours will you work, or how much will you save. These decisions do not look back to past choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes that **sunk costs**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which are costs that were incurred in the past and cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.\n\nConsider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows that it is truly terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because she paid for the ticket, or should she leave? The money she spent is a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is feeling kindly, Selena will not get a refund. But staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice is whether to spend the next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do something\u2014anything\u2014else. The lesson of sunk costs is to forget about the money and time that is irretrievably gone and instead to focus on the marginal costs and benefits of current and future options.\n\nFor people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error in judgment. Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product that is doing poorly because they spent so much money in creating and launching the product. But the lesson of sunk costs is to ignore them and make decisions based on what will happen in the future.\n\n### From a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods\n\nThe budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most models used in this book, is not realistic. After all, in a modern economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking about a model with many goods is a straightforward extension of what we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget constraint, showing the tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget constraints, showing the possible tradeoffs between many different pairs of goods. Or in more advanced classes in economics, you would use mathematical equations that include many possible goods and services that can be purchased, together with their quantities and prices, and show how the total spending on all goods and services is limited to the overall budget available. The graph with two goods that was presented here clearly illustrates that every choice has an opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over to the real world.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nEconomists see the real world as one of scarcity: that is, a world in which people\u2019s desires exceed what is possible. As a result, economic behavior involves tradeoffs in which individuals, firms, and society must give up something that they desire to obtain things that they desire more. Individuals face the tradeoff of what quantities of goods and services to consume. The budget constraint, which is the frontier of the opportunity set, illustrates the range of choices available. The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the relative price of the choices. Choices beyond the budget constraint are not affordable.\n\nOpportunity cost measures cost by what is given up in exchange. Sometimes opportunity cost can be measured in money, but it is often useful to consider time as well, or to measure it in terms of the actual resources that must be given up.\n\nMost economic decisions and tradeoffs are not all-or-nothing. Instead, they involve marginal analysis, which means they are about decisions on the margin, involving a little more or a little less. The law of diminishing marginal utility points out that as a person receives more of something\u2014whether it is a specific good or another resource\u2014the additional marginal gains tend to become smaller. Because sunk costs occurred in the past and cannot be recovered, they should be disregarded in making current decisions.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nSuppose Alphonso\u2019s town raised the price of bus tickets to $1 per trip (while the price of burgers stayed at $2 and his budget remained $10 per week.) Draw Alphonso\u2019s new budget constraint. What happens to the opportunity cost of bus tickets?\n\n\n\nThe opportunity cost of bus tickets is the number of burgers that must be given up to obtain one more bus ticket. Originally, when the price of bus tickets was 50 cents per trip, this opportunity cost was 0.50/2 = .25 burgers. The reason for this is that at the original prices, one burger ($2) costs the same as four bus tickets ($0.50), so the opportunity cost of a burger is four bus tickets, and the opportunity cost of a bus ticket is .25 (the inverse of the opportunity cost of a burger). With the new, higher price of bus tickets, the opportunity cost rises to $1/$2 or 0.50. You can see this graphically since the slope of the new budget constraint is flatter than the original one. If Alphonso spends all of his budget on burgers, the higher price of bus tickets has no impact so the horizontal intercept of the budget constraint is the same. If he spends all of his budget on bus tickets, he can now afford only half as many, so the vertical intercept is half as much. In short, the budget constraint rotates clockwise around the horizontal intercept, flattening as it goes and the opportunity cost of bus tickets increases.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C02_003}\n\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nExplain why scarcity leads to tradeoffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain why individuals make choices that are directly on the budget constraint, rather than inside the budget constraint or outside it.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question\n\n\n\nSuppose Alphonso\u2019s town raises the price of bus tickets from $0.50 to $1 and the price of burgers rises from $2 to $4. Why is the opportunity cost of bus tickets unchanged? Suppose Alphonso\u2019s weekly spending money increases from $10 to $20. How is his budget constraint affected from all three changes?

This section of the chapter will explain the constraints faced by society, using a model called the **production possibilities frontier (PPF)**{: data-type=\"term\"}. There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.\n\nBecause society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw materials) at any point in time, there is a limit to the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two products, healthcare and education. This situation is illustrated by the production possibilities frontier in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C02_010).\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C02_010 data-title=\"A Healthcare vs. Education Production Possibilities Frontier \"}\n\nIn [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C02_010), healthcare is shown on the vertical axis and education is shown on the horizontal axis. If the society were to allocate all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A. But it would not have any resources to produce education. If it were to allocate all of its resources to education, it could produce at point F. Alternatively, the society could choose to produce any combination of healthcare and education shown on the production possibilities frontier. In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society as the budget constraint plays for Alphonso. Society can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside the PPF. But it does not have enough resources to produce outside the PPF.\n\nMost important, the production possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare and education. Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and it is considering producing more education. Because the PPF is downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain more education is by giving up some healthcare. That is the tradeoff society faces. Suppose it considers moving from point B to point C. What would the opportunity cost be for the additional education? The opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to give up. Just as with Alphonso\u2019s budget constraint, the opportunity cost is shown by the **slope**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of the production possibilities frontier. By now you might be saying, \u201cHey, this PPF is sounding like the budget constraint.\u201d If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a budget constraint and a PPF?\n\nThere are two major differences between a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier. The first is the fact that the budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the relative prices of the two goods. In contrast, the PPF has a curved shape because of the law of the diminishing returns. The second is the absence of specific numbers on the axes of the PPF. There are no specific numbers because we do not know the exact amount of resources this imaginary economy has, nor do we know how many resources it takes to produce healthcare and how many resources it takes to produce education. If this were a real world example, that data would be available. An additional reason for the lack of numbers is that there is no single way to measure levels of education and healthcare. However, when you think of improvements in education, you can think of accomplishments like more years of school completed, fewer high-school dropouts, and higher scores on standardized tests. When you think of improvements in healthcare, you can think of longer life expectancies, lower levels of infant mortality, and fewer outbreaks of disease.\n\nWhether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure the opportunity cost of additional education as society moves from point B to point C on the PPF. The additional education is measured by the horizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare is given by the vertical distance between B and C. The slope of the PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the \u201crise\u201d) over the horizontal distance (the \u201crun\u201d). This is the opportunity cost of the additional education.\n\n\n\n### The Shape of the PPF and the Law of Diminishing Returns\n\nThe budget constraints presented earlier in this chapter, showing individual choices about what quantities of goods to consume, were all straight lines. The reason for these straight lines was that the slope of the budget constraint was determined by relative prices of the two goods in the **consumption budget constraint**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. However, the production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education was drawn as a curved line. Why does the PPF have a different shape?\n\nTo understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at the top left-hand side of the PPF. At point A, all available resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education. This situation would be extreme and even ridiculous. For example, children are seeing a doctor every day, whether they are sick or not, but not attending school. People are having cosmetic surgery on every part of their bodies, but no high school or college education exists. Now imagine that some of these resources are diverted from healthcare to education, so that the economy is at point B instead of point A. Diverting some resources away from A to B causes relatively little reduction in health because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services are not producing much additional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars into education, which is completely without resources at point A, can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape of the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, representing a relatively small drop-off in health and a relatively large gain in education.\n\nNow consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production possibilities frontier. Imagine that society starts at choice D, which is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to healthcare, and moves to point F, which is devoting *all* spending to education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness, you can imagine that in the movement from D to F, the last few doctors must become high school science teachers, the last few nurses must become school librarians rather than dispensers of vaccinations, and the last few emergency rooms are turned into kindergartens. The gains to education from adding these last few resources to education are very small. However, the opportunity cost lost to health will be fairly large, and thus the slope of the PPF between D and F is steep, showing a large drop in health for only a small gain in education.\n\nThe lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice like devoting no resources to education at point A or no resources to health at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from committing additional marginal resources to education depend on how much is already being spent. If on the one hand, very few resources are currently committed to education, then an increase in resources used can bring relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large number of resources are already committed to education, then committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains.\n\nThis pattern is common enough that it has been given a name: the **law of diminishing returns**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose, the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline. When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime, for example, the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large. But additional increases typically cause relatively smaller reductions in crime, and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be tremendously expensive.\n\nThe curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as additional resources are added to education, moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but gradually diminish. Similarly, as additional resources are added to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original gains are fairly large, but again gradually diminish. In this way, the law of diminishing returns produces the outward-bending shape of the production possibilities frontier.\n\n### Productive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency\n\nThe study of economics does not presume to tell a society what choice it should make along its production possibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice will involve a mixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics can point out that some choices are unambiguously better than others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In everyday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient machine operates at high **cost**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, while an efficient machine operates at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials. An inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs, while an efficient organization meets schedules, is focused, and performs within budget.\n\nThe production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C02_011) illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between healthcare and education.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C02_011 data-title=\"Productive and Allocative Efficiency \"}\n\n**Productive efficiency**{: data-type=\"term\"} means that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C02_011), including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to any other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more of one good, the other good, or some combination of both goods.\n\nFor example, point R is productively inefficient because it is possible at choice C to have more of both goods: education on the horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E<sub>2</sub> is greater than E<sub>1</sub>), and healthcare on the vertical axis is also higher at point C than point R (H<sub>2</sub> is great than H<sub>1</sub>).\n\nThe particular mix of goods and services being produced\u2014that is, the specific combination of healthcare and education chosen along the production possibilities frontier\u2014can be shown as a ray (line) from the origin to a specific point on the PPF. Output mixes that had more healthcare (and less education) would have a steeper ray, while those with more education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter ray.\n\n**Allocative efficiency**{: data-type=\"term\"} means that the particular mix of goods a society produces represents the combination that society most desires. How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually discussed in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand. Only one of the productively efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for society as a whole.\n\n### Why Society Must Choose\n\nEvery economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand consumption of all goods. In the first case, a society may discover that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by improving efficiency and producing on the production possibilities frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more of some and less of none). In the second case, as resources grow over a period of years (e.g., more labor and more capital), the economy grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to shift outward and society will be able to afford more of all goods.\n\nBut improvements in productive efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth happens only gradually. So, a society must choose between tradeoffs in the present. For government, this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm. At the individual and **firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} level, the **market economy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that people want. But for both the government and the market economy in the short term, increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy.\n\n### The PPF and Comparative Advantage    {#eip-924}\n\nWhile every society must choose how much of each good it should produce, it does not need to produce every single good it consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce depends on how expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from a different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a country\u2019s PPF gives us information about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing one good versus another. In particular, its slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good in the x-axis in terms of the other good (in the y-axis). Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing a specific good, either because of different climates, geography, technology or skills.\n\nSuppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane and wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce a lot of sugar cane per acre but not much wheat. Conversely, the U.S. can produce a lot of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane. Clearly, Brazil has a lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is also true; the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil. This can be illustrated by the PPFs of the two countries in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C02_012)\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C02_012 data-title=\"Production Possibility Frontier for the U.S. and Brazil \"}\n\nWhen a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country has a **comparative advantage**{: data-type=\"term\"} in that good. In our example, Brazil has a comparative advantage in sugar cane and the U.S. has a comparative advantage in wheat. One can easily see this with a simple observation of the extreme production points in the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to producing wheat, it would be producing at point A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing sugar cane instead, it would be producing a much larger amount, at point B. By moving from point A to point B Brazil would give up a relatively small quantity in wheat production to obtain a large production in sugar cane. The opposite is true for the U.S. If the U.S. moved from point A to B and produced only sugar cane, this would result in a large opportunity cost in terms of foregone wheat production.\n\nThe slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not constant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and therefore the opportunity cost of wheat generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter on [International Trade](/m48731) you will learn that countries\u2019 differences in comparative advantage determine which goods they will choose to produce and trade. When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods that they have comparative advantage in, and trade part of that production for goods they do not have comparative advantage in. With trade, goods are produced where the opportunity cost is lowest, so total production increases, benefiting both trading parties.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA production possibilities frontier defines the set of choices society faces for the combinations of goods and services it can produce given the resources available. The shape of the PPF is typically curved outward, rather than straight. Choices outside the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the PPF are wasteful. Over time, a growing economy will tend to shift the PPF outwards.\n\nThe law of diminishing returns holds that as increments of additional resources are devoted to producing something, the marginal increase in output will become smaller and smaller. All choices along a production possibilities frontier display productive efficiency; that is, it is impossible to use society\u2019s resources to produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice along a production possibilities frontier that reflects the mix of goods society prefers is the choice with allocative efficiency. The curvature of the PPF is likely to differ by country, which results in different countries having comparative advantage in different goods. Total production can increase if countries specialize in the goods they have comparative advantage in and trade some of their production for the remaining goods.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nReturn to the example in [[link]](#CNX_Econ_C02_011). Suppose there is an improvement in medical technology that enables more healthcare to be provided with the same amount of resources. How would this affect the production possibilities curve and, in particular, how would it affect the opportunity cost of education?\n\n\n\nBecause of the improvement in technology, the vertical intercept of the PPF would be at a higher level of healthcare. In other words, the PPF would rotate clockwise around the horizontal intercept. This would make the PPF steeper, corresponding to an increase in the opportunity cost of education, since resources devoted to education would now mean forgoing a greater quantity of healthcare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould a nation be producing in a way that is allocatively efficient, but productively inefficient?\n\n\n\nNo. Allocative efficiency requires productive efficiency, because it pertains to choices along the production possibilities frontier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the similarities between a consumer\u2019s budget constraint and society\u2019s production possibilities frontier, not just graphically but analytically?\n\n\n\nBoth the budget constraint and the PPF show the constraint that each operates under. Both show a tradeoff between having more of one good but less of the other. Both show the opportunity cost graphically as the slope of the constraint (budget or PPF).\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is comparative advantage?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does a production possibilities frontier illustrate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is a production possibilities frontier typically drawn as a curve, rather than a straight line?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain why societies cannot make a choice above their production possibilities frontier and should not make a choice below it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are diminishing marginal returns?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is productive efficiency?

It also suffered many human casualties, both soldiers and civilians. How did the war affect Germany\u2019s production possibilities curve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is clear that productive inefficiency is a waste since resources are being used in a way that produces less goods and services than a nation is capable of.

{"module_id": "m48608", "module_title": "Economics - m48608", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48608", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Analyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making\n* Interpret a tradeoff diagram\n* Contrast normative statements and positive statements\n\n\n\nIt is one thing to understand the economic approach to decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable applying it. The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that people do not act in the way that fits the economic way of thinking, and that even if people did act that way, they should try not to. Let\u2019s consider these arguments in turn.\n\n### First Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This\n\nThe economic approach to decision-making seems to require more information than most individuals possess and more careful decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all, do you or any of your friends draw a budget constraint and mutter to yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the shopping mall? Do members of the U.S. Congress contemplate production possibilities frontiers before they vote on the annual budget? The messy ways in which people and societies operate somehow doesn\u2019t look much like neat budget constraints or smoothly curving production possibilities frontiers.\n\nHowever, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and understand the tradeoffs of economic decisions even so. To appreciate this point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball, dribbling to the right, and throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or engineer could work out the correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given the different movements involved and the weight and bounciness of the ball. But when you are playing basketball, you do not perform any of these calculations. You just pass the ball, and if you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.\n\nSomeone might argue: \u201cThe scientist\u2019s formula of the bounce-pass requires a far greater knowledge of physics and far more specific information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball player actually has, so it must be an unrealistic description of how basketball passes are actually made.\u201d This reaction would be wrongheaded. The fact that a good player can throw the ball accurately because of practice and skill, without making a physics calculation, does not mean that the physics calculation is wrong.\n\nSimilarly, from an economic point of view, someone who goes shopping for groceries every week has a great deal of practice with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility, even if the shopper does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Government institutions may work imperfectly and slowly, but in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social institutions to make the choices that are most widely preferred by people in that society. So, when thinking about the economic actions of groups of people, firms, and society, it is reasonable, as a first approximation, to analyze them with the tools of economic analysis. For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the chapter on [Consumer Choices](/m48640).\n\n### Second Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way\n\nThe economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some critics of this approach, even if self-interest is an accurate description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral. Instead, the critics argue that people should be taught to care more deeply about others. Economists offer several answers to these concerns.\n\nFirst, economics is not a form of moral instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists. Philosophers draw a distinction between **positive statements**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which describe the world as it is, and **normative statements**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which describe how the world should be. For example, an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city. If the expected benefits exceed the costs, he concludes that the project is worth doing\u2014an example of positive analysis. Another economist argues for extended unemployment compensation during the Great Depression because a rich country like the United States should take care of its less fortunate citizens\u2014an example of normative analysis.\n\nEven if the line between positive and normative statements is not always crystal clear, economic analysis does try to remain rooted in the study of the actual people who inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately however, the assumption that individuals are purely self-interested is a simplification about human nature. In fact, we need to look no further than to **Adam Smith**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this. The opening sentence of his book, *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, puts it very clearly: \u201cHow selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.\u201d Clearly, individuals are both self-interested and altruistic.\n\nSecond, self-interested behavior and profit-seeking can be labeled with other names, such as personal choice and freedom. The ability to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an important personal freedom. Some people may choose high-pressure, high-paying jobs so that they can earn and spend a lot of money on themselves. Others may earn a lot of money and give it to charity or spend it on their friends and family. Others may devote themselves to a career that can require a great deal of time, energy, and expertise but does not offer high financial rewards, like being an elementary school teacher or a social worker. Still others may choose a job that does not take lots of their time or provide a high level of income, but still leaves time for family, friends, and contemplation. Some people may prefer to work for a large company; others might want to start their own business. People\u2019s freedom to make their own economic choices has a moral value worth respecting.\n\n\n\nIs a diagram by any other name the same?\n\nWhen you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of diagrams: diagrams in the text, diagrams in the lectures, diagrams in the problems, and diagrams on exams. Your goal should be to recognize the common underlying logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each of the individual diagrams.\n\nThis chapter uses only one basic diagram, although it is presented with different sets of labels. The consumption budget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same basic diagram. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C02_014) shows an individual budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier for two goods, Good 1 and Good 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic themes: scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.\n\nThe first theme is **scarcity**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. But even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts, scarcity remains\u2014just at a different level. The second theme is **tradeoffs**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary to give up some of one good to gain more of the other good. The details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint, the tradeoff is determined by the relative prices of the goods: that is, the relative price of two goods in the consumption choice budget constraint. These tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, the tradeoffs in many production possibilities frontiers are represented by a curved line because the law of diminishing returns holds that as resources are added to an area, the marginal gains tend to diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs remain.\n\nThe third theme is **economic efficiency**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, or getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an individual makes a choice along a budget constraint, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. The choice on a production possibilities set that is socially preferred, or the choice on an individual\u2019s budget constraint that is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.\n\nThe basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram will recur throughout this book. Some examples include using these tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, labor supply versus leisure, saving versus consumption, environmental protection and economic output, equality of incomes and economic output, and the macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment. Do not be confused by the different labels. The budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram is always just a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and efficiency in a particular situation.\n\n and the social production possibilities frontier show the constraints under which individual consumers and society as a whole operate. Both diagrams show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at the cost of less of the other.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C02_014 data-title=\"The Tradeoff Diagram \"}\n\n\n\n\nThird, self-interested behavior can lead to positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make a living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses to offer goods and services that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing in *The Wealth of Nations*, christened this property the **invisible hand**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In describing how consumers and producers interact in a market economy, Smith wrote:\n\n<q>Every individual\u2026generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention\u2026By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.</q>\n\nThe metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable possibility that broader social good can emerge from selfish individual actions.\n\nFourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the economic part of their life often set aside their own narrow self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus on your own self-interest when asking your employer for a raise or negotiating to buy a car. But then you might turn around and focus on other people when you volunteer to read stories at the local library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate money to a charity. Self-interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing many economic decisions, without needing to imply that people never do anything that is not in their own immediate self-interest.\n\n\n\nChoices ... To What Degree?\n\nWhat have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices we make. So, an economist might argue that people do not go on to get bachelor\u2019s degrees or master\u2019s degrees because they do not have the resources to make those choices or because their incomes are too low and/or the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor\u2019s degree or a master\u2019s degree may not be available in their opportunity set.\n\nThe price of these degrees may be too high not only because the actual price, college tuition (and perhaps room and board), is too high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full opportunity cost of a bachelor\u2019s degree or a master\u2019s degree is too high. For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff of giving up years of working, and earning an income, to earn a degree.\n\nFinally, the statistics introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about **intertemporal choices**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. An economist might say that people choose not to get a college degree because they may have to borrow money to go to college, and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today. Also, it could be that some people have a preference for current consumption over future consumption, so they choose to work now at a lower salary and consume now, rather than putting that consumption off until after they graduate college.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe economic way of thinking provides a useful approach to understanding human behavior. Economists make the careful distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative statements, which describe how the world should be. Even when economics analyzes the gains and losses from various events or policies, and thus draws normative conclusions about how the world should be, the analysis of economics is rooted in a positive analysis of how people, firms, and governments actually behave, not how they should behave.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIndividuals may not act in the rational, calculating way described by the economic model of decision making, measuring utility and costs at the margin, but can you make a case that they behave approximately that way?\n\n\n\nWhen individuals compare cost per unit in the grocery store, or characteristics of one product versus another, they are behaving approximately like the model describes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould an op-ed piece in a newspaper urging the adoption of a particular economic policy be considered a positive or normative statement?\n\n\n\nSince an op-ed makes a case for what should be, it is considered normative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould a research study on the effects of soft drink consumption on children\u2019s cognitive development be considered a positive or normative statement?\n\n\n\nAssuming that the study is not taking an explicit position about whether soft drink consumption is good or bad, but just reporting the science, it would be considered positive.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a positive and a normative statement?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the economic model of decision-making intended as a literal description of how individuals, firms, and the governments actually make decisions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are four responses to the claim that people should not behave in the way described in this chapter?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhat assumptions about the economy must be true for the invisible hand to work? To what extent are those assumptions valid in the real world?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo economists have any particular expertise at making normative arguments? In other words, they have expertise at making positive statements (i.e., what *will* happen) about some economic policy, for example, but do they have special expertise to judge whether or not the policy *should* be undertaken?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nSmith, Adam. \u201cOf Restraints upon the Importation from Foreign Countries.\u201d In *The Wealth of Nations*.

At one time, consumers had to go to specialty stores or farmer\u2019s markets to find organic produce. Now it is available in most grocery stores. In short, organic is part of the mainstream.\n\nEver wonder why organic food costs more than conventional food? Why, say, does an organic Fuji apple cost $1.99 a pound, while its conventional counterpart costs $1.49 a pound? The same price relationship is true for just about every organic product on the market. If many organic foods are locally grown, would they not take less time to get to market and therefore be cheaper? What are the forces that keep those prices from coming down? Turns out those forces have a lot to do with this chapter\u2019s topic: demand and supply.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Demand and Supply\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Demand, Supply, and Equilibrium in Markets for Goods and Services\n* Shifts in Demand and Supply for Goods and Services\n* Changes in Equilibrium Price and Quantity: The Four-Step Process\n* Price Ceilings and Price Floors\n\n\n\nAn auction bidder pays thousands of dollars for a dress Whitney Houston wore. A collector spends a small fortune for a few drawings by John Lennon. People usually react to purchases like these in two ways: their jaw drops because they think these are high prices to pay for such goods or they think these are rare, desirable items and the amount paid seems right.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read a list of bizarre items that have been purchased for their ties to celebrities. These examples represent an interesting facet of demand and supply.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nWhen economists talk about prices, they are less interested in making judgments than in gaining a practical understanding of what determines prices and why prices change. Consider a price most of us contend with weekly: that of a gallon of gas. Why was the average price of gasoline in the United States $3.71 per gallon in June 2014? Why did the price for gasoline fall sharply to $2.07 per gallon by January 2015? To explain these price movements, economists focus on the determinants of what gasoline buyers are willing to pay and what gasoline sellers are willing to accept.\n\nAs it turns out, the price of gasoline in June of any given year is nearly always higher than the price in January of that same year; over recent decades, gasoline prices in midsummer have averaged about 10 cents per gallon more than their midwinter low. The likely reason is that people drive more in the summer, and are also willing to pay more for gas, but that does not explain how steeply gas prices fell. Other factors were at work during those six months, such as increases in supply and decreases in the demand for crude oil.\n\nThis chapter introduces the economic model of demand and supply\u2014one of the most powerful models in all of economics. The discussion here begins by examining how demand and supply determine the price and the quantity sold in markets for goods and services, and how changes in demand and supply lead to changes in prices and quantities.\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/celebauction", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

Demand is based on needs and wants\u2014a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, but from an economist\u2019s perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay for it, you have no effective demand.\n\nWhat a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called **price**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The total number of units purchased at that price is called the **quantity demanded**{: data-type=\"term\"}. A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline goes up, for example, people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the **law of demand**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand (to be explained in the next module) are held constant.\n\nAn example from the market for gasoline can be shown in the form of a table or a graph. A table that shows the quantity demanded at each price, such as [\\[link\\]](#Table_03_01), is called a **demand schedule**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Price in this case is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline. The quantity demanded is measured in millions of gallons over some time period (for example, per day or per year) and over some geographic area (like a state or a country). A **demand curve**{: data-type=\"term\"} shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_001), with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis. (Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable (x) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable (y) goes on the vertical. Economics is not math.)\n\nThe demand schedule shown by [\\[link\\]](#Table_03_01) and the demand curve shown by the graph in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_001) are two ways of describing the same relationship between price and quantity demanded.\n\n . The downward slope of the demand curve again illustrates the law of demand&#x2014;the inverse relationship between prices and quantity demanded.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C03_001 data-title=\"A Demand Curve for Gasoline \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_03_01\" summary=\"The table shows the price and quantity demanded of gasoline.

They may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. Nearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope down from left to right. So demand curves embody the law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.\n\nConfused about these different types of demand? Read the next Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\nIs demand the same as quantity demanded?\n\nIn economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. When economists talk about demand, they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, as illustrated by a demand curve or a demand schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean only a certain point on the demand curve, or one quantity on the demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve and quantity demanded refers to the (specific) point on the curve.\n\n\n\n### Supply of Goods and Services\n\nWhen economists talk about **supply**{: data-type=\"term\"}, they mean the amount of some good or service a producer is willing to supply at each price. Price is what the producer receives for selling one unit of a **good**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} or **service**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. A rise in price almost always leads to an increase in the **quantity supplied**{: data-type=\"term\"} of that good or service, while a fall in price will decrease the quantity supplied. When the price of gasoline rises, for example, it encourages profit-seeking firms to take several actions: expand exploration for oil reserves; drill for more oil; invest in more pipelines and oil tankers to bring the oil to plants where it can be refined into gasoline; build new oil refineries; purchase additional pipelines and trucks to ship the gasoline to gas stations; and open more gas stations or keep existing gas stations open longer hours. Economists call this positive relationship between price and quantity supplied\u2014that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied and a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied\u2014the **law of supply**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The law of supply assumes that all other variables that affect supply (to be explained in the next module) are held constant.\n\nStill unsure about the different types of supply? See the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\nIs supply the same as quantity supplied?\n\nIn economic terminology, supply is not the same as quantity supplied. When economists refer to supply, they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities supplied at those prices, a relationship that can be illustrated with a supply curve or a supply schedule. When economists refer to quantity supplied, they mean only a certain point on the supply curve, or one quantity on the supply schedule. In short, supply refers to the curve and quantity supplied refers to the (specific) point on the curve.\n\n\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_002) illustrates the law of supply, again using the market for gasoline as an example. Like demand, supply can be illustrated using a table or a graph. A **supply schedule**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a table, like [\\[link\\]](#Table_03_02), that shows the quantity supplied at a range of different prices. Again, price is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline and quantity supplied is measured in millions of gallons. A **supply curve**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a graphic illustration of the relationship between price, shown on the vertical axis, and quantity, shown on the horizontal axis. The supply schedule and the supply curve are just two different ways of showing the same information. Notice that the horizontal and vertical axes on the graph for the supply curve are the same as for the demand curve.\n\n is created by graphing the points from the supply schedule and then connecting them. The upward slope of the supply curve illustrates the law of supply&#x2014;that a higher price leads to a higher quantity supplied, and vice versa.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C03_002 data-title=\"A Supply Curve for Gasoline \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_03_02\" summary=\"The table shows shows the price per gallon of gasoline and the quantity supplied in millions of gallons.

Nearly all supply curves, however, share a basic similarity: they slope up from left to right and illustrate the law of supply: as the price rises, say, from $1.00 per gallon to $2.20 per gallon, the quantity supplied increases from 500 gallons to 720 gallons. Conversely, as the price falls, the quantity supplied decreases.\n\n### Equilibrium\u2014Where Demand and Supply Intersect\n\nBecause the graphs for demand and supply curves both have price on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis, the demand curve and supply curve for a particular good or service can appear on the same graph. Together, demand and supply determine the price and the quantity that will be bought and sold in a market.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_003) illustrates the interaction of demand and supply in the market for gasoline. The demand curve (D) is identical to [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_001). The supply curve (S) is identical to [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_002). [\\[link\\]](#Table_03_03) contains the same information in tabular form.\n\n  and the supply curve (S) intersect at the equilibrium point E, with a price of $1.40 and a quantity of 600. The equilibrium is the only price where quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied. At a price above equilibrium like $1.80, quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, so there is excess supply. At a price below equilibrium such as $1.20, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, so there is excess demand.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C03_003 data-title=\"Demand and Supply for Gasoline \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_03_03\" summary=\"The table shows shows the price, the quantity demanded, and the quantity supplied of gasoline. It combines the information from Table 1.1 and Table 1.2. When the price per gallon is $1.00, the quantity demanded is 800 million gallons and the quantity supplied is 500 million. When the price is $1.20, the quantity demanded is 700 million gallons and the quantity supplied is 550 million gallons. At $1.40, the demand is 600 million and the quantity supplied is 600 million gallons. At $1.60, the demand is 550 million gallons and the quantity supplied is 640 million gallons.

The point where the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross, designated by point E in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_003), is called the **equilibrium**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The **equilibrium price**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the only price where the plans of consumers and the plans of producers agree\u2014that is, where the amount of the product consumers want to buy (quantity demanded) is equal to the amount producers want to sell (quantity supplied). This common quantity is called the **equilibrium quantity**{: data-type=\"term\"}. At any other price, the quantity demanded does not equal the quantity supplied, so the market is not in equilibrium at that price.\n\nIn [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_003), the equilibrium price is $1.40 per gallon of gasoline and the equilibrium quantity is 600 million gallons. If you had only the demand and supply schedules, and not the graph, you could find the equilibrium by looking for the price level on the tables where the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal.\n\nThe word \u201cequilibrium\u201d means \u201cbalance.\u201d If a market is at its equilibrium price and quantity, then it has no reason to move away from that point. However, if a market is not at equilibrium, then economic pressures arise to move the market toward the equilibrium price and the equilibrium quantity.\n\nImagine, for example, that the price of a gallon of gasoline was above the equilibrium price\u2014that is, instead of $1.40 per gallon, the price is $1.80 per gallon. This above-equilibrium price is illustrated by the dashed horizontal line at the price of $1.80 in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_003). At this higher price, the quantity demanded drops from 600 to 500. This decline in quantity reflects how consumers react to the higher price by finding ways to use less gasoline.\n\nMoreover, at this higher price of $1.80, the quantity of gasoline supplied rises from the 600 to 680, as the higher price makes it more profitable for gasoline producers to expand their output. Now, consider how quantity demanded and quantity supplied are related at this above-equilibrium price. Quantity demanded has fallen to 500 gallons, while quantity supplied has risen to 680 gallons. In fact, at any above-equilibrium price, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. We call this an **excess supply**{: data-type=\"term\"} or a **surplus**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nWith a surplus, gasoline accumulates at gas stations, in tanker trucks, in pipelines, and at oil refineries. This accumulation puts pressure on gasoline sellers. If a surplus remains unsold, those firms involved in making and selling gasoline are not receiving enough cash to pay their workers and to cover their expenses. In this situation, some producers and sellers will want to cut prices, because it is better to sell at a lower price than not to sell at all. Once some sellers start cutting prices, others will follow to avoid losing sales. These price reductions in turn will stimulate a higher quantity demanded. So, if the price is above the equilibrium level, incentives built into the structure of demand and supply will create pressures for the price to fall toward the equilibrium.\n\nNow suppose that the price is below its equilibrium level at $1.20 per gallon, as the dashed horizontal line at this price in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_003) shows. At this lower price, the quantity demanded increases from 600 to 700 as drivers take longer trips, spend more minutes warming up the car in the driveway in wintertime, stop sharing rides to work, and buy larger cars that get fewer miles to the gallon. However, the below-equilibrium price reduces gasoline producers\u2019 incentives to produce and sell gasoline, and the quantity supplied falls from 600 to 550.\n\nWhen the price is below equilibrium, there is **excess demand**{: data-type=\"term\"}, or a **shortage**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014that is, at the given price the quantity demanded, which has been stimulated by the lower price, now exceeds the quantity supplied, which had been depressed by the lower price. In this situation, eager gasoline buyers mob the gas stations, only to find many stations running short of fuel. Oil companies and gas stations recognize that they have an opportunity to make higher profits by selling what gasoline they have at a higher price. As a result, the price rises toward the equilibrium level. Read [Demand, Supply, and Efficiency](/m48832) for more discussion on the importance of the demand and supply model.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA demand schedule is a table that shows the quantity demanded at different prices in the market. A demand curve shows the relationship between quantity demanded and price in a given market on a graph. The law of demand states that a higher price typically leads to a lower quantity demanded.\n\nA supply schedule is a table that shows the quantity supplied at different prices in the market. A supply curve shows the relationship between quantity supplied and price on a graph. The law of supply says that a higher price typically leads to a higher quantity supplied.\n\nThe equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity occur where the supply and demand curves cross. The equilibrium occurs where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. If the price is below the equilibrium level, then the quantity demanded will exceed the quantity supplied. Excess demand or a shortage will exist. If the price is above the equilibrium level, then the quantity supplied will exceed the quantity demanded. Excess supply or a surplus will exist. In either case, economic pressures will push the price toward the equilibrium level.\n\n### Self-Check Question\n\n\n\nReview [[link]](#CNX_Econ_C03_003). Suppose the price of gasoline is $1.60 per gallon. Is the quantity demanded higher or lower than at the equilibrium price of $1.40 per gallon? And what about the quantity supplied? Is there a shortage or a surplus in the market? If so, of how much?\n\n\n\nSince $1.60 per gallon is above the equilibrium price, the quantity demanded would be lower at 550 gallons and the quantity supplied would be higher at 640 gallons. (These results are due to the laws of demand and supply, respectively.) The outcome of lower Qd and higher Qs would be a surplus in the gasoline market of 640 \u2013 550 = 90 gallons.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat determines the level of prices in a market?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does a downward-sloping demand curve mean about how buyers in a market will react to a higher price?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill demand curves have the same exact shape in all markets? If not, how will they differ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill supply curves have the same shape in all markets? If not, how will they differ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between quantity demanded and quantity supplied at equilibrium? What is the relationship when there is a shortage? What is the relationship when there is a surplus?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can you locate the equilibrium point on a demand and supply graph?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the price is above the equilibrium level, would you predict a surplus or a shortage? If the price is below the equilibrium level, would you predict a surplus or a shortage? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the price is above the equilibrium, explain how market forces move the market price to equilibrium. Do the same when the price is below the equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the demand and the quantity demanded of a product, say milk? Explain in words and show the difference on a graph with a demand curve for milk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between the supply and the quantity supplied of a product, say milk? Explain in words and show the difference on a graph with the supply curve for milk.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nReview [[link]](#CNX_Econ_C03_003). Suppose the government decided that, since gasoline is a necessity, its price should be legally capped at $1.30 per gallon. What do you anticipate would be the outcome in the gasoline market?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain why the following statement is false: \u201cIn the goods market, no buyer would be willing to pay more than the equilibrium price.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain why the following statement is false: \u201cIn the goods market, no seller would be willing to sell for less than the equilibrium price.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nReview [[link]](#CNX_Econ_C03_003) again. Suppose the price of gasoline is $1.00. Will the quantity demanded be lower or higher than at the equilibrium price of $1.40 per gallon? Will the quantity supplied be lower or higher? Is there a shortage or a surplus in the market? If so, of how much?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nCostanza, Robert, and Lisa Wainger. \u201cNo Accounting For Nature: How Conventional Economics Distorts the Value of Things.\u201d *The Washington Post*.

The result was the demand curve and the supply curve. Price, however, is not the only thing that influences demand. Nor is it the only thing that influences supply. For example, how is demand for vegetarian food affected if, say, health concerns cause more consumers to avoid eating meat? Or how is the supply of diamonds affected if diamond producers discover several new diamond mines? What are the major factors, in addition to the price, that influence demand or supply?\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read a brief note on how marketing strategies can influence supply and demand of products.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### What Factors Affect Demand?\n\nWe defined demand as the amount of some product a consumer is willing and able to purchase at each price. That suggests at least two factors in addition to price that affect demand. Willingness to purchase suggests a desire, based on what economists call tastes and preferences. If you neither need nor want something, you will not buy it. Ability to purchase suggests that income is important. Professors are usually able to afford better housing and transportation than students, because they have more income. Prices of related goods can affect demand also. If you need a new car, the price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford. Finally, the size or composition of the population can affect demand. The more children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing. The more driving-age children a family has, the greater their demand for car insurance, and the less for diapers and baby formula.\n\nThese factors matter both for demand by an individual and demand by the market as a whole. Exactly how do these various factors affect demand, and how do we show the effects graphically? To answer those questions, we need the *ceteris paribus* assumption.\n\n### The *Ceteris Paribus* Assumption\n\nA **demand curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} or a **supply curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is a relationship between two, and only two, variables: quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors, other than the product\u2019s price, are changing. Economists call this assumption **ceteris paribus**{: data-type=\"term\"}, a Latin phrase meaning \u201cother things being equal.\u201d Any given demand or supply curve is based on the *ceteris paribus* assumption that all else is held equal. A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two, variables when all other variables are kept constant. If all else is not held equal, then the laws of supply and demand will not necessarily hold, as the following Clear It Up feature shows.\n\n\n\nWhen does *ceteris paribus* apply?\n\n*Ceteris paribus* is typically applied when we look at how changes in price affect demand or supply, but *ceteris paribus* can be applied more generally. In the real world, demand and supply depend on more factors than just price. For example, a consumer\u2019s demand depends on income and a producer\u2019s supply depends on the cost of producing the product. How can we analyze the effect on demand or supply if multiple factors are changing at the same time\u2014say price rises and income falls? The answer is that we examine the changes one at a time, assuming the other factors are held constant.\n\nFor example, we can say that an increase in the price reduces the amount consumers will buy (assuming income, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). Additionally, a decrease in income reduces the amount consumers can afford to buy (assuming price, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). This is what the *ceteris paribus* assumption really means. In this particular case, after we analyze each factor separately, we can combine the results. The amount consumers buy falls for two reasons: first because of the higher price and second because of the lower income.\n\n\n\n### How Does Income Affect Demand?\n\nLet\u2019s use income as an example of how factors other than price affect demand. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_004) shows the initial demand for automobiles as D<sub>0</sub>. At point Q, for example, if the price is $20,000 per car, the quantity of cars demanded is 18 million. D<sub>0</sub> also shows how the quantity of cars demanded would change as a result of a higher or lower price. For example, if the price of a car rose to $22,000, the quantity demanded would decrease to 17 million, at point R.\n\nThe original demand curve D<sub>0</sub>, like every demand curve, is based on the *ceteris paribus* assumption that no other economically relevant factors change. Now imagine that the economy expands in a way that raises the incomes of many people, making cars more affordable. How will this affect demand? How can we show this graphically?\n\nReturn to [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_004). The price of cars is still $20,000, but with higher incomes, the quantity demanded has now increased to 20 million cars, shown at point S. As a result of the higher income levels, the demand curve shifts to the right to the new demand curve D<sub>1</sub>, indicating an increase in demand. [\\[link\\]](#Table_03_04) shows clearly that this increased demand would occur at every price, not just the original one.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C03_004 data-title=\"Shifts in Demand: A Car Example \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_03_04\" summary=\"The table is called &#x201C;Price and Demand Shifts: A Car Example.&#x201D; It has four columns that show how the demand for cars changes at different levels.

In this case, the decrease in income would lead to a lower quantity of cars demanded at every given price, and the original demand curve D<sub>0</sub> would shift left to D<sub>2</sub>. The shift from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>2</sub> represents such a decrease in demand: At any given price level, the quantity demanded is now lower. In this example, a price of $20,000 means 18 million cars sold along the original demand curve, but only 14.4 million sold after demand fell.\n\nWhen a demand curve shifts, it does not mean that the quantity demanded by every individual buyer changes by the same amount. In this example, not everyone would have higher or lower income and not everyone would buy or not buy an additional car. Instead, a shift in a demand curve captures an pattern for the market as a whole.\n\nIn the previous section, we argued that higher income causes greater demand at every price. This is true for most goods and services. For some\u2014luxury cars, vacations in Europe, and fine jewelry\u2014the effect of a rise in income can be especially pronounced. A product whose demand rises when income rises, and vice versa, is called a **normal good**{: data-type=\"term\"}. A few exceptions to this pattern do exist. As incomes rise, many people will buy fewer generic brand groceries and more name brand groceries. They are less likely to buy used cars and more likely to buy new cars. They will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home, and so on. A product whose demand falls when income rises, and vice versa, is called an **inferior good**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In other words, when income increases, the demand curve shifts to the left.\n\n### Other Factors That Shift Demand Curves\n\nIncome is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand. Other things that change demand include tastes and preferences, the composition or size of the population, the prices of related goods, and even expectations. A change in any one of the underlying factors that determine what quantity people are willing to buy at a given price will cause a shift in demand. Graphically, the new demand curve lies either to the right (an increase) or to the left (a decrease) of the original demand curve. Let\u2019s look at these factors.\n\n**Changing Tastes or Preferences**\n\nFrom 1980 to 2014, the per-person consumption of chicken by Americans rose from 48 pounds per year to 85 pounds per year, and consumption of beef fell from 77 pounds per year to 54 pounds per year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Changes like these are largely due to movements in taste, which change the quantity of a good demanded at every price: that is, they shift the demand curve for that good, rightward for chicken and leftward for beef.\n\n<strong>Changes in the Composition of the Population </strong>\n\nThe proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising. It rose from 9.8% in 1970 to 12.6% in 2000, and will be a projected (by the **U.S. Census Bureau**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}) 20% of the population by 2030. A society with relatively more children, like the United States in the 1960s, will have greater demand for goods and services like tricycles and day care facilities. A society with relatively more elderly persons, as the United States is projected to have by 2030, has a higher demand for nursing homes and hearing aids. Similarly, changes in the size of the population can affect the demand for housing and many other goods. Each of these changes in demand will be shown as a shift in the demand curve.\n\nThe demand for a product can also be affected by changes in the prices of related goods such as substitutes or complements. A **substitute**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a good or service that can be used in place of another good or service. As electronic books, like this one, become more available, you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books. A lower price for a substitute decreases demand for the other product. For example, in recent years as the price of tablet computers has fallen, the quantity demanded has increased (because of the law of demand). Since people are purchasing tablets, there has been a decrease in demand for laptops, which can be shown graphically as a leftward shift in the demand curve for laptops. A higher price for a substitute good has the reverse effect.\n\nOther goods are **complements**{: data-type=\"term\"} for each other, meaning that the goods are often used together, because consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other. Examples include breakfast cereal and milk; notebooks and pens or pencils, golf balls and golf clubs; gasoline and sport utility vehicles; and the five-way combination of bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and bread. If the price of golf clubs rises, since the quantity demanded of golf clubs falls (because of the law of demand), demand for a complement good like golf balls decreases, too. Similarly, a higher price for skis would shift the demand curve for a complement good like ski resort trips to the left, while a lower price for a complement has the reverse effect.\n\n**Changes in Expectations about Future Prices or Other Factors that Affect Demand**\n\nWhile it is clear that the price of a good affects the quantity demanded, it is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about tastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand. For example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the store to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. If people learn that the price of a good like coffee is likely to rise in the future, they may head for the store to stock up on coffee now. These changes in demand are shown as shifts in the curve. Therefore, a **shift in demand**{: data-type=\"term\"} happens when a change in some economic factor (other than price) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price. The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens.\n\n\n\nShift in Demand\n\nA shift in demand means that at any price (and at every price), the quantity demanded will be different than it was before. Following is an example of a shift in demand due to an income increase.\n\nStep 1. Draw the graph of a demand curve for a normal good like pizza. Pick a price (like P<sub>0</sub>). Identify the corresponding Q<sub>0</sub>. An example is shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_019).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C03_019 data-title=\"Demand Curve \"}\n\n\nStep 2. Suppose income increases. As a result of the change, are consumers going to buy more or less pizza? The answer is more. Draw a dotted horizontal line from the chosen price, through the original quantity demanded, to the new point with the new Q<sub>1</sub>. Draw a dotted vertical line down to the horizontal axis and label the new Q<sub>1</sub>. An example is provided in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_020).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C03_020 data-title=\"Demand Curve with Income Increase \"}\n\n\nStep 3. Now, shift the curve through the new point. You will see that an increase in income causes an upward (or rightward) shift in the demand curve, so that at any price the quantities demanded will be higher, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_021).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C03_021 data-title=\"Demand Curve Shifted Right \"}\n\n\n\n\n### Summing Up Factors That Change Demand\n\nSix factors that can shift demand curves are summarized in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_026). The direction of the arrows indicates whether the demand curve shifts represent an increase in demand or a decrease in demand. Notice that a change in the price of the good or service itself is not listed among the factors that can shift a demand curve. A change in the price of a good or service causes a movement along a specific demand curve, and it typically leads to some change in the quantity demanded, but it does not shift the demand curve.\n\n  A list of factors that can cause an increase in demand from D0 to D1. (b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in demand from D0 to D1.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C03_026 data-title=\"Factors That Shift Demand Curves \"}\n\nWhen a demand curve shifts, it will then intersect with a given supply curve at a different equilibrium price and quantity. We are, however, getting ahead of our story. Before discussing how changes in demand can affect equilibrium price and quantity, we first need to discuss shifts in supply curves.\n\n### How Production Costs Affect Supply\n\nA supply curve shows how quantity supplied will change as the price rises and falls, assuming *ceteris paribus* so that no other economically relevant factors are changing. If other factors relevant to supply do change, then the entire supply curve will shift. Just as a shift in demand is represented by a change in the quantity demanded at every price, a **shift in supply**{: data-type=\"term\"} means a change in the quantity supplied at every price.\n\nIn thinking about the factors that affect supply, remember what motivates firms: profits, which are the difference between revenues and costs. Goods and services are produced using combinations of labor, materials, and machinery, or what we call **inputs**{: data-type=\"term\"} or **factors of production**{: data-type=\"term\"}. If a firm faces lower costs of production, while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged, a firm\u2019s profits go up. When a firm\u2019s profits increase, it is more motivated to produce output, since the more it produces the more profit it will earn. So, when costs of production fall, a firm will tend to supply a larger quantity at any given price for its output. This can be shown by the supply curve shifting to the right.\n\nTake, for example, a messenger company that delivers packages around a city. The company may find that buying gasoline is one of its main costs. If the price of gasoline falls, then the company will find it can deliver messages more cheaply than before. Since lower costs correspond to higher profits, the messenger company may now supply more of its services at any given price. For example, given the lower gasoline prices, the company can now serve a greater area, and increase its supply.\n\nConversely, if a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any given selling price for its products. As a result, a higher cost of production typically causes a firm to supply a smaller quantity at any given price. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the left.\n\nConsider the supply for cars, shown by curve S<sub>0</sub> in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_007). Point J indicates that if the price is $20,000, the quantity supplied will be 18 million cars. If the price rises to $22,000 per car, *ceteris paribus,* the quantity supplied will rise to 20 million cars, as point K on the S<sub>0</sub> curve shows. The same information can be shown in table form, as in [\\[link\\]](#Table_03_05).\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C03_007 data-title=\"Shifts in Supply: A Car Example \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_03_05\" summary=\"The table is called &#x201C;Price and Shifts in Supply: A Car Example.&#x201D; It has four columns that show how the supply of cars changes at different levels. The four columns are Price, Decrease to D1, Original Quantity Supplied S0, and Increase to S2. When a car is priced at $16,000, the Decrease to S1 is 10.5 million cars. The Original Quantity Supplied S0 is 12.0 million and the Increase to S2 is 13.2 million. When a car is $18,000, the Decrease to S1 is 13.5 million. The Original Quantity Supplied S0 is 15.0 million and the Increase to S2 is 16.5 million. At $20,000, the Decrease to S2 is 16.5 million cars. The Original Quantity Supplied S0 is 18.0 million and the Increase to S2 is 19.8 million. At $22,000, the Decrease to S1 is 18.5 million cars. The Original Quantity Supplied S0 is 20.0 million and the Increase to S2 is 22.0 million. At $24,000, the Decrease to S1 is 20.5 million cars. The Original Quantity Supplied S0 is 19.5 million and the Increase to S2 is 23.1 million. Finally, at $26,000, the Decrease to S1 is 20.5 million cars. The Original Quantity Supplied S0 is 22.0 million and the Increase to S2 is 24.2 million.\"><caption><span data-type=\"title\">Price and Shifts in Supply: A Car Example</span></caption><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Price</th>\n<th>Decrease to S<sub>1</sub></th>\n<th>Original Quantity Supplied S<sub>0</sub></th>\n<th>Increase to S<sub>2</sub></th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody><tr>\n<td>$16,000</td>\n<td>10.5 million</td>\n<td>12.0 million</td>\n<td>13.2 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$18,000</td>\n<td>13.5 million</td>\n<td>15.0 million</td>\n<td>16.5 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$20,000</td>\n<td>16.5 million</td>\n<td>18.0 million</td>\n<td>19.8 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$22,000</td>\n<td>18.5 million</td>\n<td>20.0 million</td>\n<td>22.0 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$24,000</td>\n<td>19.5 million</td>\n<td>21.0 million</td>\n<td>23.1 million</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>$26,000</td>\n<td>20.5 million</td>\n<td>22.0 million</td>\n<td>24.2 million</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\nNow, imagine that the price of steel, an important ingredient in manufacturing cars, rises, so that producing a car has become more expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers will react by supplying a lower quantity. This can be shown graphically as a leftward shift of supply, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>, which indicates that at any given price, the quantity supplied decreases. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied decreases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S<sub>0</sub>) to 16.5 million on the supply curve S<sub>1</sub>, which is labeled as point L.\n\nConversely, if the price of steel decreases, producing a car becomes less expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers can now expect to earn higher profits, so they will supply a higher quantity. The shift of supply to the right, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>2</sub>, means that at all prices, the quantity supplied has increased. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied increases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S<sub>0</sub>) to 19.8 million on the supply curve S<sub>2</sub>, which is labeled M.\n\n### Other Factors That Affect Supply\n\nIn the example above, we saw that changes in the prices of inputs in the production process will affect the cost of production and thus the supply. Several other things affect the cost of production, too, such as changes in weather or other natural conditions, new technologies for production, and some government policies.\n\nThe cost of production for many agricultural products will be affected by changes in natural conditions. For example, in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China, which produces most of the country\\'s wheat, corn, and soybeans, experienced its most severe drought in 50 years. A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products, which means that at any given price, a lower quantity will be supplied; conversely, especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right.\n\nWhen a **firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. For instance, in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice. By the early 1990s, more than two-thirds of the wheat and rice in low-income countries around the world was grown with these Green Revolution seeds\u2014and the harvest was twice as high per acre. A technological improvement that reduces costs of production will shift supply to the right, so that a greater quantity will be produced at any given price.\n\nGovernment policies can affect the cost of production and the supply curve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies. For example, the U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects about $8 billion per year from producers. Taxes are treated as costs by businesses. Higher costs decrease supply for the reasons discussed above. Other examples of policy that can affect cost are the wide array of government regulations that require firms to spend money to provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace; complying with regulations increases costs.\n\nA government subsidy, on the other hand, is the opposite of a tax. A subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the firm\u2019s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. From the firm\u2019s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of production that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower quantity at every given price. Government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at every given price, shifting supply to the right. The following Work It Out feature shows how this shift happens.\n\n\n\nShift in Supply\n\nWe know that a supply curve shows the minimum price a firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output. What happens to the supply curve when the cost of production goes up? Following is an example of a shift in supply due to a production cost increase.\n\nStep 1. Draw a graph of a supply curve for pizza. Pick a quantity (like Q<sub>0</sub>). If you draw a vertical line up from Q<sub>0</sub> to the supply curve, you will see the price the firm chooses. An example is shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_022).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C03_022 data-title=\"Suppy Curve \"}\n\n\nStep 2. Why did the firm choose that price and not some other? One way to think about this is that the price is composed of two parts. The first part is the average cost of production, in this case, the cost of the pizza ingredients (dough, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, and so on), the cost of the pizza oven, the rent on the shop, and the wages of the workers. The second part is the firm\u2019s desired profit, which is determined, among other factors, by the profit margins in that particular business. If you add these two parts together, you get the price the firm wishes to charge. The quantity Q0 and associated price P0 give you one point on the firm\u2019s supply curve, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_023).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C03_023 data-title=\"Setting Prices \"}\n\n\nStep 3. Now, suppose that the cost of production goes up. Perhaps cheese has become more expensive by $0.75 per pizza. If that is true, the firm will want to raise its price by the amount of the increase in cost ($0.75). Draw this point on the supply curve directly above the initial point on the curve, but $0.75 higher, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_024).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C03_024 data-title=\"Increasing Costs Leads to Increasing Price \"}\n\n\nStep 4. Shift the supply curve through this point. You will see that an increase in cost causes an upward (or a leftward) shift of the supply curve so that at any price, the quantities supplied will be smaller, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_025).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C03_025 data-title=\"Supply Curve Shifts \"}\n\n\n\n\n### Summing Up Factors That Change Supply\n\nChanges in the cost of inputs, natural disasters, new technologies, and the impact of government decisions all affect the cost of production. In turn, these factors affect how much firms are willing to supply at any given price.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_027) summarizes factors that change the supply of goods and services. Notice that a change in the price of the product itself is not among the factors that shift the supply curve. Although a change in price of a good or service typically causes a change in quantity supplied or a movement along the supply curve for that specific good or service, it does not cause the supply curve itself to shift.\n\n A list of factors that can cause an increase in supply from S0 to S1. (b) The same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in supply from S0 to S1.&#10;\"){: #CNX_Econ_C03_027 data-title=\"Factors That Shift Supply Curves \"}\n\nBecause demand and supply curves appear on a two-dimensional diagram with only price and quantity on the axes, an unwary visitor to the land of economics might be fooled into believing that economics is about only four topics: demand, supply, price, and quantity. However, demand and supply are really \u201cumbrella\u201d concepts: demand covers all the factors that affect demand, and supply covers all the factors that affect supply. Factors other than price that affect demand and supply are included by using shifts in the demand or the supply curve. In this way, the two-dimensional demand and supply model becomes a powerful tool for analyzing a wide range of economic circumstances.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nEconomists often use the *ceteris paribus* or \u201cother things being equal\u201d assumption: while examining the economic impact of one event, all other factors remain unchanged for the purpose of the analysis. Factors that can shift the demand curve for goods and services, causing a different quantity to be demanded at any given price, include changes in tastes, population, income, prices of substitute or complement goods, and expectations about future conditions and prices. Factors that can shift the supply curve for goods and services, causing a different quantity to be supplied at any given price, include input prices, natural conditions, changes in technology, and government taxes, regulations, or subsidies.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhy do economists use the *ceteris paribus* assumption?\n\n\n\nTo make it easier to analyze complex problems. *Ceteris paribus* allows you to look at the effect of one factor at a time on what it is you are trying to analyze. When you have analyzed all the factors individually, you add the results together to get the final answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an analysis of the market for paint, an economist discovers the facts listed below. State whether each of these changes will affect supply or demand, and in what direction.\n\n1.  There have recently been some important cost-saving inventions in the technology for making paint.\n2.  Paint is lasting longer, so that property owners need not repaint as often.\n3.  Because of severe hailstorms, many people need to repaint now.\n4.  The hailstorms damaged several factories that make paint, forcing them to close down for several months.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  An improvement in technology that reduces the cost of production will cause an increase in supply. Alternatively, you can think of this as a reduction in price necessary for firms to supply any quantity. Either way, this can be shown as a rightward (or downward) shift in the supply curve.\n2.  An improvement in product quality is treated as an increase in tastes or preferences, meaning consumers demand more paint at any price level, so demand increases or shifts to the right. If this seems counterintuitive, note that demand in the future for the longer-lasting paint will fall, since consumers are essentially shifting demand from the future to the present.\n3.  An increase in need causes an increase in demand or a rightward shift in the demand curve.\n4.  Factory damage means that firms are unable to supply as much in the present. Technically, this is an increase in the cost of production. Either way you look at it, the supply curve shifts to the left.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany changes are affecting the market for oil. Predict how each of the following events will affect the equilibrium price and quantity in the market for oil. In each case, state how the event will affect the supply and demand diagram. Create a sketch of the diagram if necessary.\n\n1.  Cars are becoming more fuel efficient, and therefore get more miles to the gallon.\n2.  The winter is exceptionally cold.\n3.  A major discovery of new oil is made off the coast of Norway.\n4.  The economies of some major oil-using nations, like Japan, slow down.\n5.  A war in the Middle East disrupts oil-pumping schedules.\n6.  Landlords install additional insulation in buildings.\n7.  The price of solar energy falls dramatically.\n8.  Chemical companies invent a new, popular kind of plastic made from oil.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  More fuel-efficient cars means there is less need for gasoline. This causes a leftward shift in the demand for gasoline and thus oil. Since the demand curve is shifting down the supply curve, the equilibrium price and quantity both fall.\n2.  Cold weather increases the need for heating oil. This causes a rightward shift in the demand for heating oil and thus oil. Since the demand curve is shifting up the supply curve, the equilibrium price and quantity both rise.\n3.  A discovery of new oil will make oil more abundant. This can be shown as a rightward shift in the supply curve, which will cause a decrease in the equilibrium price along with an increase in the equilibrium quantity. (The supply curve shifts down the demand curve so price and quantity follow the law of demand. If price goes down, then the quantity goes up.)\n4.  When an economy slows down, it produces less output and demands less input, including energy, which is used in the production of virtually everything. A decrease in demand for energy will be reflected as a decrease in the demand for oil, or a leftward shift in demand for oil. Since the demand curve is shifting down the supply curve, both the equilibrium price and quantity of oil will fall.\n5.  Disruption of oil pumping will reduce the supply of oil. This leftward shift in the supply curve will show a movement up the demand curve, resulting in an increase in the equilibrium price of oil and a decrease in the equilibrium quantity.\n6.  Increased insulation will decrease the demand for heating. This leftward shift in the demand for oil causes a movement down the supply curve, resulting in a decrease in the equilibrium price and quantity of oil.\n7.  Solar energy is a substitute for oil-based energy. So if solar energy becomes cheaper, the demand for oil will decrease as consumers switch from oil to solar. The decrease in demand for oil will be shown as a leftward shift in the demand curve. As the demand curve shifts down the supply curve, both equilibrium price and quantity for oil will fall.\n8.  A new, popular kind of plastic will increase the demand for oil. The increase in demand will be shown as a rightward shift in demand, raising the equilibrium price and quantity of oil.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhen analyzing a market, how do economists deal with the problem that many factors that affect the market are changing at the same time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName some factors that can cause a shift in the demand curve in markets for goods and services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName some factors that can cause a shift in the supply curve in markets for goods and services.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nConsider the demand for hamburgers.

It might be an event that affects demand, like a change in income, population, tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, or expectations about future prices. It might be an event that affects supply, like a change in natural conditions, input prices, or technology, or government policies that affect production. How does this economic event affect equilibrium price and quantity? We will analyze this question using a four-step process.\n\nStep 1. Draw a demand and supply model before the economic change took place. To establish the model requires four standard pieces of information: The law of demand, which tells us the slope of the demand curve; the law of supply, which gives us the slope of the supply curve; the shift variables for demand; and the shift variables for supply. From this model, find the initial equilibrium values for price and quantity.\n\nStep 2. Decide whether the economic change being analyzed affects demand or supply. In other words, does the event refer to something in the list of demand factors or supply factors?\n\nStep 3. Decide whether the effect on demand or supply causes the curve to shift to the right or to the left, and sketch the new demand or supply curve on the diagram. In other words, does the event increase or decrease the amount consumers want to buy or producers want to sell?\n\nStep 4. Identify the new equilibrium and then compare the original equilibrium price and quantity to the new equilibrium price and quantity.\n\nLet\u2019s consider one example that involves a shift in supply and one that involves a shift in demand. Then we will consider an example where both supply and demand shift.\n\n### Good Weather for Salmon Fishing\n\nIn the summer of 2000, weather conditions were excellent for commercial salmon fishing off the California coast. Heavy rains meant higher than normal levels of water in the rivers, which helps the salmon to breed. Slightly cooler ocean temperatures stimulated the growth of plankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain, providing everything in the ocean with a hearty food supply. The ocean stayed calm during fishing season, so commercial fishing operations did not lose many days to bad weather. How did these climate conditions affect the quantity and price of salmon? [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_010) illustrates the four-step approach, which is explained below, to work through this problem. [\\[link\\]](#Table_03_07) provides the information to work the problem as well.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C03_010 data-title=\"Good Weather for Salmon Fishing: The Four-Step Process \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_03_07\" summary=\"The table is called &#x201C;Salmon Fishing.&#x201D; It has 4 columns and 7 rows.

Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate the market for salmon in the year before the good weather conditions began. The demand curve D<sub>0</sub> and the supply curve S<sub>0</sub> show that the original equilibrium price is $3.25 per pound and the original equilibrium quantity is 250,000 fish. (This price per pound is what commercial buyers pay at the fishing docks; what consumers pay at the grocery is higher.)\n\nStep 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Good weather is an example of a natural condition that affects supply.\n\nStep 3. Was the effect on supply an increase or a decrease? Good weather is a change in natural conditions that increases the quantity supplied at any given price. The supply curve shifts to the right, moving from the original supply curve S<sub>0</sub> to the new supply curve S<sub>1</sub>, which is shown in both the table and the figure.\n\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium. At the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub>, the equilibrium price falls from $3.25 to $2.50, but the equilibrium quantity increases from 250,000 to 550,000 salmon. Notice that the equilibrium quantity demanded increased, even though the demand curve did not move.\n\nIn short, good weather conditions increased supply of the California commercial salmon. The result was a higher equilibrium quantity of salmon bought and sold in the market at a lower price.\n\n### Newspapers and the Internet\n\nAccording to the **Pew Research Center for People and the Press**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, more and more people, especially younger people, are getting their news from online and digital sources. The majority of U.S. adults now own smartphones or tablets, and most of those Americans say they use them in part to get the news. From 2004 to 2012, the share of Americans who reported getting their news from digital sources increased from 24% to 39%. How has this affected consumption of print news media, and radio and television news? [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_011) and the text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer this question.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C03_011 data-title=\"The Print News Market: A Four-Step Analysis \"}\n\nStep 1. Develop a demand and supply model to think about what the market looked like before the event. The demand curve D<sub>0</sub> and the supply curve S<sub>0</sub> show the original relationships. In this case, the analysis is performed without specific numbers on the price and quantity axis.\n\nStep 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? A change in tastes, from traditional news sources (print, radio, and television) to digital sources, caused a change in demand for the former.\n\nStep 3. Was the effect on demand positive or negative? A shift to digital news sources will tend to mean a lower quantity demanded of traditional news sources at every given price, causing the demand curve for print and other traditional news sources to shift to the left, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>.\n\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>).\n\nThe decline in print news reading predates 2004. Print newspaper circulation peaked in 1973 and has declined since then due to competition from television and radio news. In 1991, 55% of Americans indicated they got their news from print sources, while only 29% did so in 2012. Radio news has followed a similar path in recent decades, with the share of Americans getting their news from radio declining from 54% in 1991 to 33% in 2012. Television news has held its own over the last 15 years, with a market share staying in the mid to upper fifties. What does this suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30 years old say they do not get their news from television at all?\n\n### The Interconnections and Speed of Adjustment in Real Markets\n\nIn the real world, many factors that affect demand and supply can change all at once. For example, the demand for cars might increase because of rising incomes and population, and it might decrease because of rising gasoline prices (a complementary good). Likewise, the supply of cars might increase because of innovative new technologies that reduce the cost of car production, and it might decrease as a result of new government regulations requiring the installation of costly pollution-control technology.\n\nMoreover, rising incomes and population or changes in gasoline prices will affect many markets, not just cars. How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events? The answer lies in the ***ceteris paribus***{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} assumption. Look at how each economic event affects each market, one event at a time, holding all else constant. Then combine the analyses to see the net effect.\n\n### A Combined Example\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service is facing difficult challenges. Compensation for postal workers tends to increase most years due to cost-of-living increases. At the same time, more and more people are using email, text, and other digital message forms such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate with friends and others. What does this suggest about the continued viability of the Postal Service? [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_029) and the text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer this question.\n\n  Higher labor compensation causes a leftward shift in the supply curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and an increase in the equilibrium price. (b) A change in tastes away from Postal Services causes a leftward shift in the demand curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and a decrease in the equilibrium price.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C03_029 data-title=\"Higher Compensation for Postal Workers: A Four-Step Analysis \"}\n\nSince this problem involves two disturbances, we need two four-step analyses, the first to analyze the effects of higher compensation for postal workers, the second to analyze the effects of many people switching from \u201csnailmail\u201d to email and other digital messages.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_029) (a) shows the shift in supply discussed in the following steps.\n\nStep 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for the U.S. Postal Service looked like before this scenario starts. The demand curve D<sub>0</sub> and the supply curve S<sub>0</sub> show the original relationships.\n\nStep 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? Labor compensation is a cost of production. A change in production costs caused a change in supply for the Postal Service.\n\nStep 3. Was the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor compensation leads to a lower quantity supplied of postal services at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services to shift to the left, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>.\n\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at a lower quantity and a higher price than the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>).\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_029) (b) shows the shift in demand discussed in the following steps.\n\nStep 1. Draw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for U.S. Postal Services looked like before this scenario starts. The demand curve D<sub>0</sub> and the supply curve S<sub>0</sub> show the original relationships. Note that this diagram is independent from the diagram in panel (a).\n\nStep 2. Did the change described affect supply or demand? A change in tastes away from snailmail toward digital messages will cause a change in demand for the Postal Service.\n\nStep 3. Was the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor compensation leads to a lower quantity supplied of postal services at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services to shift to the left, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>.\n\nStep 4. Compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E<sub>2</sub>) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>).\n\nThe final step in a scenario where both supply and demand shift is to combine the two individual analyses to determine what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. Graphically, we superimpose the previous two diagrams one on top of the other, as in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_030).\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C03_030 data-title=\"Combined Effect of Decreased Demand and Decreased Supply \"}\n\nFollowing are the results:\n\nEffect on Quantity: The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services because it raises the cost of production is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. The effect of a change in tastes away from snailmail is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. Since both shifts are to the left, the overall impact is a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of Postal Services (Q<sub>3</sub>). This is easy to see graphically, since Q<sub>3</sub> is to the left of Q<sub>0</sub>.\n\nEffect on Price: The overall effect on price is more complicated. The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services, because it raises the cost of production, is to increase the equilibrium price. The effect of a change in tastes away from snailmail is to decrease the equilibrium price. Since the two effects are in opposite directions, unless we know the magnitudes of the two effects, the overall effect is unclear. This is not unusual. When both curves shift, typically we can determine the overall effect on price or on quantity, but not on both. In this case, we determined the overall effect on the equilibrium quantity, but not on the equilibrium price. In other cases, it might be the opposite.\n\nThe next Clear It Up feature focuses on the difference between shifts of supply or demand and movements along a curve.\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between shifts of demand or supply versus movements along a demand or supply curve?\n\nOne common mistake in applying the demand and supply framework is to confuse the shift of a demand or a supply curve with movement along a demand or supply curve. As an example, consider a problem that asks whether a drought will increase or decrease the equilibrium quantity and equilibrium price of wheat. Lee, a student in an introductory economics class, might reason:\n\n\u201cWell, it is clear that a drought reduces supply, so I will shift back the supply curve, as in the shift from the original supply curve S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub> shown on the diagram (called Shift 1). So the equilibrium moves from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>, the **equilibrium quantity**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is lower and the equilibrium price is higher. Then, a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good, so the supply curve shifts right, as shown by the shift from S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>2</sub>, on the diagram (shown as Shift 2), so that the equilibrium now moves from E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub>. The higher price, however, also reduces demand and so causes demand to shift back, like the shift from the original demand curve, D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> on the diagram (labeled Shift 3), and the equilibrium moves from E<sub>2</sub> to E<sub>3</sub>.\u201d\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C03_018 data-title=\"Shifts of Demand or Supply versus Movements along a Demand or Supply Curve \"}\n\n\nAt about this point, Lee suspects that this answer is headed down the wrong path. Think about what might be wrong with Lee\u2019s logic, and then read the answer that follows.\n\n*Answer:* Lee\u2019s first step is correct: that is, a drought shifts back the supply curve of wheat and leads to a prediction of a lower equilibrium quantity and a higher equilibrium price. This corresponds to a movement along the original demand curve (D<sub>0</sub>), from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>. The rest of Lee\u2019s argument is wrong, because it mixes up shifts in supply with quantity supplied, and shifts in demand with quantity demanded. A higher or lower price never shifts the supply curve, as suggested by the shift in supply from S<sub>1</sub> to S<sub>2</sub>. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given supply curve. Similarly, a higher or lower price never shifts a demand curve, as suggested in the shift from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given demand curve. Remember, a change in the price of a good never causes the demand or supply curve for that good to shift.\n\nThink carefully about the timeline of events: What happens first, what happens next? What is cause, what is effect? If you keep the order right, you are more likely to get the analysis correct.\n\n\n\nIn the four-step analysis of how economic events affect equilibrium price and quantity, the movement from the old to the new equilibrium seems immediate. As a practical matter, however, prices and quantities often do not zoom straight to equilibrium. More realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to shift, prices and quantities set off in the general direction of equilibrium. Indeed, even as they are moving toward one new equilibrium, prices are often then pushed by another change in demand or supply toward another equilibrium.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nWhen using the supply and demand framework to think about how an event will affect the equilibrium price and quantity, proceed through four steps: (1) sketch a supply and demand diagram to think about what the market looked like before the event; (2) decide whether the event will affect supply or demand; (3) decide whether the effect on supply or demand is negative or positive, and draw the appropriate shifted supply or demand curve; (4) compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original ones.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s think about the market for air travel. From August 2014 to January 2015, the price of jet fuel decreased roughly 47%. Using the four-step analysis, how do you think this fuel price decrease affected the equilibrium price and quantity of air travel?\n\n\n\nStep 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves. Label the initial equilibrium price and quantity.\n\nStep 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? Jet fuel is a cost of producing air travel, so an increase in jet fuel price affects supply.\n\nStep 3. An increase in the price of jet fuel caused a decrease in the cost of air travel. We show this as a downward or rightward shift in supply.\n\nStep 4. A rightward shift in supply causes a movement down the demand curve, lowering the equilibrium price of air travel and increasing the equilibrium quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods. Suppose the U.S. government cuts the tariff on imported flat screen televisions. Using the four-step analysis, how do you think the tariff reduction will affect the equilibrium price and quantity of flat screen TVs?\n\n\n\nStep 1. Draw the graph with the initial supply and demand curves. Label the initial equilibrium price and quantity.\n\nStep 2. Did the economic event affect supply or demand? A tariff is treated like a cost of production, so this affects supply.\n\nStep 3. A tariff reduction is equivalent to a decrease in the cost of production, which we can show as a rightward (or downward) shift in supply.\n\nStep 4. A rightward shift in supply causes a movement down the demand curve, lowering the equilibrium price and raising the equilibrium quantity.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nHow does one analyze a market where both demand and supply shift?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat causes a movement along the demand curve? What causes a movement along the supply curve?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nUse the four-step process to analyze the impact of the advent of the iPod (or other portable digital music players) on the equilibrium price and quantity of the Sony Walkman (or other portable audio cassette players).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the four-step process to analyze the impact of a reduction in tariffs on imports of iPods on the equilibrium price and quantity of Sony Walkman-type products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose both of these events took place at the same time. Combine your analyses of the impacts of the iPod and the tariff reduction to determine the likely impact on the equilibrium price and quantity of Sony Walkman-type products.

In some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians, who may then pass legislation to prevent a certain price from climbing \u201ctoo high\u201d or falling \u201ctoo low.\u201d\n\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the incentives provided by these laws to control prices, in ways that will often lead to undesirable consequences. Alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price control laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs.\n\n### Price Ceilings\n\nLaws that government enacts to regulate prices are called **Price controls**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Price controls come in two flavors. A **price ceiling**{: data-type=\"term\"} keeps a price from rising above a certain level (the \u201cceiling\u201d), while a **price floor**{: data-type=\"term\"} keeps a price from falling below a certain level (the \u201cfloor\u201d). This section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings. The next section discusses price floors.\n\nIn many markets for goods and services, demanders outnumber suppliers. Consumers, who are also potential voters, sometimes unite behind a political proposal to hold down a certain price. In some cities, such as Albany, renters have pressed political leaders to pass rent control laws, a price ceiling that usually works by stating that rents can be raised by only a certain maximum percentage each year.\n\nRent control becomes a politically hot topic when rents begin to rise rapidly. Everyone needs an affordable place to live. Perhaps a change in tastes makes a certain suburb or town a more popular place to live. Perhaps locally-based businesses expand, bringing higher incomes and more people into the area. Changes of this sort can cause a change in the demand for rental housing, as [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_012) illustrates. The original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) lies at the intersection of supply curve S<sub>0</sub> and demand curve D<sub>0</sub>, corresponding to an equilibrium price of $500 and an equilibrium quantity of 15,000 units of rental housing. The effect of greater income or a change in tastes is to shift the demand curve for rental housing to the right, as shown by the data in [\\[link\\]](#Table_03_10) and the shift from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> on the graph. In this market, at the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub>, the price of a rental unit would rise to $600 and the equilibrium quantity would increase to 17,000 units.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C03_012 data-title=\"A Price Ceiling Example&#x2014;Rent Control \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_03_10\" summary=\"The table is called &#x201C;Rent Control.&#x201D; It has 4 rows and 5 columns.

In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_012), the horizontal line at the price of $500 shows the legally fixed maximum price set by the rent control law. However, the underlying forces that shifted the demand curve to the right are still there. At that price ($500), the quantity supplied remains at the same 15,000 rental units, but the quantity demanded is 19,000 rental units. In other words, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, so there is a shortage of rental housing. One of the ironies of price ceilings is that while the price ceiling was intended to help renters, there are actually fewer apartments rented out under the price ceiling (15,000 rental units) than would be the case at the market rent of $600 (17,000 rental units).\n\nPrice ceilings do not simply benefit renters at the expense of landlords. Rather, some renters (or potential renters) lose their housing as landlords convert apartments to co-ops and condos. Even when the housing remains in the rental market, landlords tend to spend less on maintenance and on essentials like heating, cooling, hot water, and lighting. The first rule of economics is you do not get something for nothing\u2014everything has an opportunity cost. So if renters get \u201ccheaper\u201d housing than the market requires, they tend to also end up with lower quality housing.\n\nPrice ceilings have been proposed for other products. For example, price ceilings to limit what producers can charge have been proposed in recent years for prescription drugs, doctor and hospital fees, the charges made by some automatic teller bank machines, and auto insurance rates. Price ceilings are enacted in an attempt to keep prices low for those who demand the product. But when the market price is not allowed to rise to the equilibrium level, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, and thus a shortage occurs. Those who manage to purchase the product at the lower price given by the price ceiling will benefit, but sellers of the product will suffer, along with those who are not able to purchase the product at all. Quality is also likely to deteriorate.\n\n### Price Floors\n\nA price floor is the lowest legal price that can be paid in markets for goods and services, labor, or financial capital. Perhaps the best-known example of a price floor is the minimum wage, which is based on the normative view that someone working full time ought to be able to afford a basic standard of living. The federal minimum wage at the end of 2014 was $7.25 per hour, which yields an income for a single person slightly higher than the poverty line. As the cost of living rises over time, the Congress periodically raises the federal minimum wage.\n\nPrice floors are sometimes called \u201cprice supports,\u201d because they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. Around the world, many countries have passed laws to create agricultural price supports. Farm prices and thus farm incomes fluctuate, sometimes widely. So even if, on average, farm incomes are adequate, some years they can be quite low. The purpose of price supports is to prevent these swings.\n\nThe most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product, adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be. According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013, the **European Union (EU)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} will spend about 60 billion euros per year, or 67 billion dollars per year, or roughly 38% of the EU budget, on price supports for Europe\u2019s farmers from 2014 to 2020.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_013) illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in Europe. In the absence of government intervention, the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E<sub>0</sub>, with price P<sub>0</sub> and quantity Q<sub>0</sub>. However, policies to keep prices high for farmers keeps the price above what would have been the market equilibrium level\u2014the price Pf shown by the dashed horizontal line in the diagram. The result is a quantity supplied in excess of the quantity demanded (Qd). When quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, a surplus exists.\n\nThe high-income areas of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Japan, are estimated to spend roughly $1 billion per day in supporting their farmers. If the government is willing to purchase the excess supply (or to provide payments for others to purchase it), then farmers will benefit from the price floor, but taxpayers and consumers of food will pay the costs. Numerous proposals have been offered for reducing farm subsidies. In many countries, however, political support for subsidies for farmers remains strong. Either because this is viewed by the population as supporting the traditional rural way of life or because of the lobbying power of the agro-business industry.\n\nFor more detail on the effects price ceilings and floors have on demand and supply, see the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n  and supply (S) would be at the equilibrium point E0. However, a price floor set at Pf holds the price above E0 and prevents it from falling. The result of the price floor is that the quantity supplied Qs exceeds the quantity demanded Qd. There is excess supply, also called a surplus.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C03_013 data-title=\"European Wheat Prices: A Price Floor Example \"}\n\n\n\nDo price ceilings and floors change demand or supply?\n\nNeither price ceilings nor price floors cause demand or supply to change. They simply set a price that limits what can be legally charged in the market. Remember, changes in price do not cause demand or supply to change. Price ceilings and price floors can cause a different choice of quantity demanded along a demand curve, but they do not move the demand curve. Price controls can cause a different choice of quantity supplied along a supply curve, but they do not shift the supply curve.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nPrice ceilings prevent a price from rising above a certain level. When a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied, and excess demand or shortages will result. Price floors prevent a price from falling below a certain level. When a price floor is set above the equilibrium price, quantity supplied will exceed quantity demanded, and excess supply or surpluses will result. Price floors and price ceilings often lead to unintended consequences.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the effect of a price ceiling on the quantity demanded of the product? What is the effect of a price ceiling on the quantity supplied? Why exactly does a price ceiling cause a shortage?\n\n\n\nA price ceiling (which is below the equilibrium price) will cause the quantity demanded to rise and the quantity supplied to fall. This is why a price ceiling creates a shortage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes a price ceiling change the equilibrium price?\n\n\n\nA price ceiling is just a legal restriction. Equilibrium is an economic condition. People may or may not obey the price ceiling, so the actual price may be at or above the price ceiling, but the price ceiling does not change the equilibrium price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would be the impact of imposing a price floor below the equilibrium price?\n\n\n\nA price ceiling is a legal maximum price, but a price floor is a legal minimum price and, consequently, it would leave room for the price to rise to its equilibrium level. In other words, a price floor below equilibrium will not be binding and will have no effect.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nDoes a price ceiling attempt to make a price higher or lower?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does a price ceiling set below the equilibrium level affect quantity demanded and quantity supplied?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes a price floor attempt to make a price higher or lower?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does a price floor set above the equilibrium level affect quantity demanded and quantity supplied?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nMost government policy decisions have winners and losers. What are the effects of raising the minimum wage? It is more complex than simply producers lose and workers gain. Who are the winners and who are the losers, and what exactly do they win and lose? To what extent does the policy change achieve its goals?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgricultural price supports result in governments holding large inventories of agricultural products. Why do you think the government cannot simply give the products away to poor people?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you propose a policy that would induce the market to supply more rental housing units?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nA low-income country decides to set a price ceiling on bread so it can make sure that bread is affordable to the poor. The conditions of demand and supply are given in [[link]](#Table_03_11). What are the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity before the price ceiling? What will the excess demand or the shortage (that is, quantity demanded minus quantity supplied) be if the price ceiling is set at $2.40? At $2.00?

{"module_id": "m50323", "module_title": "Economics - m50323", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m50323", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Contrast consumer surplus, producer surplus, and social surplus\n* Explain why price floors and price ceilings can be inefficient\n* Analyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism\n\n\n\nThe familiar **demand and supply diagram**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} holds within it the concept of economic efficiency. One typical way that economists define **efficiency**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another. Conversely, if a situation is inefficient, it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others.\n\nEfficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning: The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved. In other words, the optimal amount of each good and service is being produced and consumed.\n\n### Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, Social Surplus\n\nConsider a market for tablet computers, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_015). The equilibrium price is $80 and the equilibrium quantity is 28 million. To see the benefits to consumers, look at the segment of the demand curve above the **equilibrium**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} point and to the left. This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some demanders would have been willing to pay more than $80 for a tablet.\n\nFor example, point J shows that if the price was $90, 20 million tablets would be sold. Those consumers who would have been willing to pay $90 for a tablet based on the utility they expect to receive from it, but who were able to pay the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received a benefit beyond what they had to pay for. Remember, the demand curve traces consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for different quantities. The amount that individuals would have been willing to pay, minus the amount that they actually paid, is called **consumer surplus**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Consumer surplus is the area labeled F\u2014that is, the area above the market price and below the demand curve.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C03_015 data-title=\"Consumer and Producer Surplus \"}\n\nThe supply curve shows the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price. For example, point K in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_015) illustrates that, at $45, firms would still have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Those producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $45, but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product. The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller\u2019s actual cost is called **producer surplus**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_015), producer surplus is the area labeled G\u2014that is, the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium.\n\nThe sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is **social surplus**{: data-type=\"term\"}, also referred to as **economic surplus**{: data-type=\"term\"} or **total surplus**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_015), social surplus would be shown as the area F + G. Social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity. This demonstrates the economic efficiency of the market equilibrium. In addition, at the efficient level of output, it is impossible to produce greater consumer surplus without reducing producer surplus, and it is impossible to produce greater producer surplus without reducing consumer surplus.\n\n### Inefficiency of Price Floors and Price Ceilings\n\nThe imposition of a price floor or a price ceiling will prevent a market from adjusting to its equilibrium price and quantity, and thus will create an inefficient outcome. But there is an additional twist here. Along with creating inefficiency, price floors and ceilings will also transfer some consumer surplus to producers, or some producer surplus to consumers.\n\nImagine that several firms develop a promising but expensive new drug for treating back pain. If this therapy is left to the market, the equilibrium price will be $600 per month and 20,000 people will use the drug, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_028) (a). The original level of consumer surplus is T + U and producer surplus is V + W + X. However, the government decides to impose a price ceiling of $400 to make the drug more affordable. At this price ceiling, firms in the market now produce only 15,000.\n\nAs a result, two changes occur. First, an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced. The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called **deadweight loss**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In a very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_028) (a), the deadweight loss is the area U + W. When deadweight loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher, in this case because the **price control**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is blocking some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be willing to make.\n\nA second change from the **price ceiling**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers. After the price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. In other words, the price ceiling transfers the area of surplus (V) from producers to consumers. Note that the gain to consumers is less than the loss to producers, which is just another way of seeing the deadweight loss.\n\n  The original equilibrium price is $600 with a quantity of 20,000. Consumer surplus is T + U, and producer surplus is V + W + X. A price ceiling is imposed at $400, so firms in the market now produce only a quantity of 15,000. As a result, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. (b) The original equilibrium is $8 at a quantity of 1,800. Consumer surplus is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. A price floor is imposed at $12, which means that quantity demanded falls to 1,400. As a result, the new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C03_028 data-title=\"Efficiency and Price Floors and Ceilings \"}\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C03_028) (b) shows a price floor example using a string of struggling movie theaters, all in the same city. The current equilibrium is $8 per movie ticket, with 1,800 people attending movies. The original consumer surplus is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. The city government is worried that movie theaters will go out of business, reducing the entertainment options available to citizens, so it decides to impose a price floor of $12 per ticket. As a result, the quantity demanded of movie tickets falls to 1,400. The new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I. In effect, the **price floor**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} causes the area H to be transferred from consumer to producer surplus, but also causes a deadweight loss of J + K.\n\nThis analysis shows that a price ceiling, like a law establishing rent controls, will transfer some producer surplus to consumers\u2014which helps to explain why consumers often favor them. Conversely, a price floor like a guarantee that farmers will receive a certain price for their crops will transfer some consumer surplus to producers, which explains why producers often favor them. However, both price floors and price ceilings block some transactions that buyers and sellers would have been willing to make, and creates deadweight loss. Removing such barriers, so that prices and quantities can adjust to their equilibrium level, will increase the economy\u2019s social surplus.\n\n### Demand and Supply as a Social Adjustment Mechanism\n\nThe demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply, but by the interaction between the two. In 1890, the famous economist **Alfred Marshall**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} wrote that asking whether supply or demand determined a price was like arguing \u201cwhether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper.\u201d The answer is that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always involved.\n\nThe adjustments of equilibrium price and quantity in a market-oriented economy often occur without much government direction or oversight. If the coffee crop in Brazil suffers a terrible frost, then the supply curve of coffee shifts to the left and the price of coffee rises. Some people\u2014call them the coffee addicts\u2014continue to drink coffee and pay the higher price. Others switch to tea or soft drinks. No government commission is needed to figure out how to adjust coffee prices, which companies will be allowed to process the remaining supply, which supermarkets in which cities will get how much coffee to sell, or which consumers will ultimately be allowed to drink the brew. Such adjustments in response to price changes happen all the time in a market economy, often so smoothly and rapidly that we barely notice them.\n\nThink for a moment of all the seasonal foods that are available and inexpensive at certain times of the year, like fresh corn in midsummer, but more expensive at other times of the year. People alter their diets and restaurants alter their menus in response to these fluctuations in prices without fuss or fanfare. For both the U.S. economy and the world economy as a whole, markets\u2014that is, demand and supply\u2014are the primary social mechanism for answering the basic questions about what is produced, how it is produced, and for whom it is produced.\n\n\n\nWhy Can We Not Get Enough of Organic?\n\nOrganic food is grown without synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers or genetically modified seeds. In recent decades, the demand for organic products has increased dramatically. The Organic Trade Association reported sales increased from $1 billion in 1990 to $35.1 billion in 2013, more than 90% of which were sales of food products.\n\nWhy, then, are organic foods more expensive than their conventional counterparts? The answer is a clear application of the theories of supply and demand. As people have learned more about the harmful effects of chemical fertilizers, growth hormones, pesticides and the like from large-scale factory farming, our tastes and preferences for safer, organic foods have increased. This change in tastes has been reinforced by increases in income, which allow people to purchase pricier products, and has made organic foods more mainstream. This has led to an increased demand for organic foods. Graphically, the demand curve has shifted right, and we have moved up the supply curve as producers have responded to the higher prices by supplying a greater quantity.\n\nIn addition to the movement along the supply curve, we have also had an increase in the number of farmers converting to organic farming over time. This is represented by a shift to the right of the supply curve. Since both demand and supply have shifted to the right, the resulting equilibrium quantity of organic foods is definitely higher, but the price will only fall when the increase in supply is larger than the increase in demand. We may need more time before we see lower prices in organic foods. Since the production costs of these foods may remain higher than conventional farming, because organic fertilizers and pest management techniques are more expensive, they may never fully catch up with the lower prices of non-organic foods.\n\nAs a final, specific example: The Environmental Working Group\u2019s \u201cDirty Dozen\u201d list of fruits and vegetables, which test high for pesticide residue even after washing, was released in April 2013. The inclusion of strawberries on the list has led to an increase in demand for organic strawberries, resulting in both a higher equilibrium price and quantity of sales.\n\n\n\n<section data-depth=\"1\" class=\"summary\" markdown=\"1\">\nConsumer surplus is the gap between the price that consumers are willing to pay, based on their preferences, and the market equilibrium price. Producer surplus is the gap between the price for which producers are willing to sell a product, based on their costs, and the market equilibrium price. Social surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Total surplus is larger at the equilibrium quantity and price than it will be at any other quantity and price. Deadweight loss is loss in total surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity.\n\n</section>\n\n<section data-depth=\"1\" class=\"self-check-questions\">\n\n\nDoes a price ceiling increase or decrease the number of transactions in a market? Why? What about a price floor?\n\n\n\nAssuming that people obey the price ceiling, the market price will be below equilibrium, which means that Qd will be more than Qs. Buyers can only buy what is offered for sale, so the number of transactions will fall to Qs. This is easy to see graphically. By analogous reasoning, with a price floor the market price will be above the equilibrium price, so Qd will be less than Qs. Since the limit on transactions here is demand, the number of transactions will fall to Qd. Note that because both price floors and price ceilings reduce the number of transactions, social surplus is less.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a price floor benefits producers, why does a price floor reduce social surplus?\n\n\n\nBecause the losses to consumers are greater than the benefits to producers, so the net effect is negative.

As this population grows older, they will be faced with common healthcare issues such as heart conditions, arthritis, and Alzheimer\u2019s that may require hospitalization, long-term, or at-home nursing care. Aging baby boomers and advances in life-saving and life-extending technologies will increase the demand for healthcare and nursing. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act, which expands access to healthcare for millions of Americans, will further increase the demand.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, registered nursing jobs are expected to increase by 19% between 2012 and 2022. The median annual wage of $67,930 (in 2012) is also expected to increase. The BLS forecasts that 526,000 new nurses will be needed by 2022. One concern is the low rate of enrollment in nursing programs to help meet the growing demand. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), enrollment in 2011 increased by only 5.1% due to a shortage of nursing educators and teaching facilities.\n\nThese data tell us, as economists, that the market for healthcare professionals, and nurses in particular, will face several challenges. Our study of supply and demand will help us to analyze what might happen in the labor market for nursing and other healthcare professionals, as discussed in the second half of this case at the end of the chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Labor and Financial Markets\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Demand and Supply at Work in Labor Markets\n* Demand and Supply in Financial Markets\n* The Market System as an Efficient Mechanism for Information\n\n\n\nThe theories of supply and demand do not apply just to markets for goods. They apply to any market, even markets for labor and financial services. Labor markets are markets for employees or jobs. Financial services markets are markets for saving or borrowing.\n\nWhen we think about demand and supply curves in goods and services markets, it is easy to picture who the demanders and suppliers are: businesses produce the products and households buy them. Who are the demanders and suppliers in labor and financial service markets? In labor markets job seekers (individuals) are the suppliers of labor, while firms and other employers who hire labor are the demanders for labor. In financial markets, any individual or firm who saves contributes to the supply of money, and any who borrows (person, firm, or government) contributes to the demand for money.\n\nAs a college student, you most likely participate in both labor and financial markets. Employment is a fact of life for most college students: In 2011, says the BLS, 52% of undergraduates worked part time and another 20% worked full time. Most college students are also heavily involved in financial markets, primarily as borrowers. Among full-time students, about half take out a loan to help finance their education each year, and those loans average about $6,000 per year. Many students also borrow for other expenses, like purchasing a car. As this chapter will illustrate, we can analyze labor markets and financial markets with the same tools we use to analyze demand and supply in the goods markets.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

The law of demand applies in labor markets this way: A higher **salary**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} or **wage**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis}\u2014that is, a higher price in the labor market\u2014leads to a decrease in the quantity of labor demanded by employers, while a lower salary or wage leads to an increase in the quantity of labor demanded. The law of supply functions in labor markets, too: A higher price for labor leads to a higher quantity of labor supplied; a lower price leads to a lower quantity supplied.\n\n### Equilibrium in the Labor Market\n\nIn 2013, about 34,000 registered nurses worked in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, Minnesota-Wisconsin metropolitan area, according to the BLS. They worked for a variety of employers: hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices, schools, health clinics, and nursing homes. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_001) illustrates how demand and supply determine equilibrium in this labor market. The demand and supply schedules in [\\[link\\]](#Table_04_01) list the quantity supplied and quantity demanded of nurses at different salaries.\n\n of those employers who want to hire nurses intersects with the supply curve (S) of those who are qualified and willing to work as nurses at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium salary is $70,000 and the equilibrium quantity is 34,000 nurses. At an above-equilibrium salary of $75,000, quantity supplied increases to 38,000, but the quantity of nurses demanded at the higher pay declines to 33,000. At this above-equilibrium salary, an excess supply or surplus of nurses would exist. At a below-equilibrium salary of $60,000, quantity supplied declines to 27,000, while the quantity demanded at the lower wage increases to 40,000 nurses. At this below-equilibrium salary, excess demand or a surplus exists.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C04_001 data-title=\"Labor Market Example: Demand and Supply for Nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington\"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_04_01\" summary=\"This table has three columns and six rows. The first row is a header row and it labels each column, 'Annual Salary,' 'Quantity Demanded,' and 'Quantity Supplied.' Under the 'Annual Salary' column are the values: $55,000; $60,000; $65,000; $70,000; $75,000; and $80,000. Under the 'Quantity Demanded' column are the values: 45,000; 40,000; 37,000; 34,000; 33,000; and 32,000.

In this example, labor is measured by number of workers, but another common way to measure the quantity of labor is by the number of hours worked. The vertical axis shows the price for nurses\u2019 labor\u2014that is, how much they are paid. In the real world, this \u201cprice\u201d would be total labor compensation: salary plus benefits. It is not obvious, but benefits are a significant part (as high as 30 percent) of labor compensation. In this example, the price of labor is measured by salary on an annual basis, although in other cases the price of labor could be measured by monthly or weekly pay, or even the wage paid per hour. As the salary for nurses rises, the quantity demanded will fall. Some hospitals and nursing homes may cut back on the number of nurses they hire, or they may lay off some of their existing nurses, rather than pay them higher salaries. Employers who face higher nurses\u2019 salaries may also try to replace some nursing functions by investing in physical equipment, like computer monitoring and diagnostic systems to monitor patients, or by using lower-paid health care aides to reduce the number of nurses they need.\n\nAs the salary for nurses rises, the quantity supplied will rise. If nurses\u2019 salaries in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington are higher than in other cities, more nurses will move to Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington to find jobs, more people will be willing to train as nurses, and those currently trained as nurses will be more likely to pursue nursing as a full-time job. In other words, there will be more nurses looking for jobs in the area.\n\nAt **equilibrium**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis}, the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded are equal. Thus, every employer who wants to hire a nurse at this equilibrium wage can find a willing worker, and every nurse who wants to work at this equilibrium salary can find a job. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_001), the supply curve (S) and demand curve (D) intersect at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium quantity of nurses in the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington area is 34,000, and the equilibrium salary is $70,000 per year. This example simplifies the nursing market by focusing on the \u201caverage\u201d nurse. In reality, of course, the market for nurses is actually made up of many smaller markets, like markets for nurses with varying degrees of experience and credentials. Many markets contain closely related products that differ in quality; for instance, even a simple product like gasoline comes in regular, premium, and super-premium, each with a different price. Even in such cases, discussing the average price of gasoline, like the average salary for nurses, can still be useful because it reflects what is happening in most of the submarkets.\n\nWhen the price of labor is not at the equilibrium, economic incentives tend to move salaries toward the equilibrium. For example, if salaries for nurses in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington were above the equilibrium at $75,000 per year, then 38,000 people want to work as nurses, but employers want to hire only 33,000 nurses. At that above-equilibrium salary, excess supply or a surplus results. In a situation of excess supply in the **labor market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis}, with many applicants for every job opening, employers will have an incentive to offer lower wages than they otherwise would have. Nurses\u2019 salary will move down toward equilibrium.\n\nIn contrast, if the salary is below the equilibrium at, say, $60,000 per year, then a situation of excess demand or a shortage arises. In this case, employers encouraged by the relatively lower wage want to hire 40,000 nurses, but only 27,000 individuals want to work as nurses at that salary in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. In response to the shortage, some employers will offer higher pay to attract the nurses. Other employers will have to match the higher pay to keep their own employees. The higher salaries will encourage more nurses to train or work in Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington. Again, price and quantity in the labor market will move toward equilibrium.\n\n### Shifts in Labor Demand\n\nThe demand curve for labor shows the quantity of labor employers wish to hire at any given salary or wage rate, under the ***ceteris paribus***{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} assumption. A change in the wage or salary will result in a change in the quantity demanded of labor. If the wage rate increases, employers will want to hire fewer employees. The quantity of labor demanded will decrease, and there will be a movement upward along the demand curve. If the wages and salaries decrease, employers are more likely to hire a greater number of workers. The quantity of labor demanded will increase, resulting in a downward movement along the demand curve.\n\nShifts in the demand curve for labor occur for many reasons. One key reason is that the demand for labor is based on the demand for the good or service that is being produced. For example, the more new automobiles consumers demand, the greater the number of workers automakers will need to hire. Therefore the demand for labor is called a \u201cderived demand.\u201d Here are some examples of derived demand for labor:\n\n* The demand for chefs is dependent on the demand for restaurant meals.\n* The demand for pharmacists is dependent on the demand for prescription drugs.\n* The demand for attorneys is dependent on the demand for legal services.\n\nAs the demand for the goods and services increases, the demand for labor will increase, or shift to the right, to meet employers\u2019 production requirements. As the demand for the goods and services decreases, the demand for labor will decrease, or shift to the left. [\\[link\\]](#Table_04_02) shows that in addition to the derived demand for labor, demand can also increase or decrease (shift) in response to several factors.\n\n<table id=\"Table_04_02\" summary=\"This table has two columns and six rows. The columns are labeled 'Factors' and 'Results.' Under the 'Factors' column are the following phrases, 'Demand for Output,' 'Education and Training,' 'Technology,' 'Number of Companies,' 'Government Regulations,' and 'Price and Availability of Other Inputs.' Under the 'Results' column are the following explanations: 'When the demand for the good produced (output) increases, both the output price and profitability increase. As a result, producers demand more labor to ramp up production,' 'Well-trained and educated workforce causes an increase in the demand for that labor by employers.

A decrease in the number of companies producing a given product will decrease the demand for labor resulting in a shift to the left,' 'Complying with government regulations can increase or decrease the demand for labor at any given wage. In the heath care industry, government rules may require that nurses be hired to carry out certain medical procedures. This will increase the demand for nurses. Less-trained healthcare workers would be prohibited from carrying out these procedures, and the demand for these workers will shift to the left,' and 'Labor is not the only input into the production process. For example, a sales person at a call center needs a telephone and a computer terminal to enter data and record sales. The demand for salespersons at the call center will increase if the number of telephones and computer terminals available increases. This will cause a rightward shift of the demand curve. As the amount of inputs increases, the demand for labor will increase. If the terminal or the telephones malfunction, then the demand for that labor force will decrease. As the quantity of other inputs decreases, the demand for labor will decrease. Similarly, if prices of other inputs fall, production will become more profitable and suppliers will demand more labor in increase production. The opposite is also true.

However, other events like those outlined here will cause either the demand or the supply of labor to shift, and thus will move the labor market to a new equilibrium salary and quantity.\n\n### Technology and Wage Inequality: The Four-Step Process\n\nEconomic events can change the equilibrium salary (or wage) and quantity of labor. Consider how the wave of new information technologies, like computer and telecommunications networks, has affected low-skill and high-skill workers in the U.S. economy. From the perspective of employers who demand labor, these new technologies are often a substitute for low-skill laborers like file clerks who used to keep file cabinets full of paper records of transactions. However, the same new technologies are a complement to high-skill workers like managers, who benefit from the technological advances by being able to monitor more information, communicate more easily, and juggle a wider array of responsibilities. So, how will the new technologies affect the wages of high-skill and low-skill workers? For this question, the four-step process of analyzing how shifts in supply or demand affect a market (introduced in [Demand and Supply](/m48628)) works in this way:\n\nStep 1. What did the markets for low-skill labor and high-skill labor look like before the arrival of the new technologies? In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_009) (a) and [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_009) (b), S<sub>0</sub> is the original supply curve for labor and D<sub>0</sub> is the original demand curve for labor in each market. In each graph, the original point of equilibrium, E<sub>0</sub>, occurs at the price W<sub>0</sub> and the quantity Q<sub>0</sub>.\n\n The demand for low-skill labor shifts to the left when technology can do the job previously done by these workers. (b) New technologies can also increase the demand for high-skill labor in fields such as information technology and network administration.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C04_009 data-title=\"Technology and Wages: Applying Demand and Supply \"}\n\nStep 2. Does the new technology affect the supply of labor from households or the demand for labor from firms? The technology change described here affects demand for labor by firms that hire workers.\n\nStep 3. Will the new technology increase or decrease demand? Based on the description earlier, as the substitute for low-skill labor becomes available, demand for low-skill labor will shift to the left, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. As the technology complement for high-skill labor becomes cheaper, demand for high-skill labor will shift to the right, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>.\n\nStep 4. The new equilibrium for low-skill labor, shown as point E<sub>1</sub> with price W<sub>1</sub> and quantity Q<sub>1</sub>, has a lower wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium, E<sub>0</sub>. The new equilibrium for high-skill labor, shown as point E<sub>1</sub> with price W<sub>1</sub> and quantity Q<sub>1</sub>, has a higher wage and quantity hired than the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>).\n\nSo, the demand and supply model predicts that the new computer and communications technologies will raise the pay of high-skill workers but reduce the pay of low-skill workers. Indeed, from the 1970s to the mid-2000s, the wage gap widened between high-skill and low-skill labor. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in 1980, for example, a college graduate earned about 30% more than a high school graduate with comparable job experience, but by 2012, a college graduate earned about 60% more than an otherwise comparable high school graduate. Many economists believe that the trend toward greater wage inequality across the U.S. economy was primarily caused by the new technologies.\n\n\nVisit this [website][2] to read about ten tech skills that have lost relevance in today\u2019s workforce.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Price Floors in the Labor Market: Living Wages and Minimum Wages\n\nIn contrast to goods and services markets, price ceilings are rare in labor markets, because rules that prevent people from earning income are not politically popular. There is one exception: sometimes limits are proposed on the high incomes of top business executives.\n\nThe labor market, however, presents some prominent examples of price floors, which are often used as an attempt to increase the wages of low-paid workers. The U.S. government sets a **minimum wage**{: data-type=\"term\"}, a price floor that makes it illegal for an employer to pay employees less than a certain hourly rate. In mid-2009, the U.S. minimum wage was raised to $7.25 per hour. Local political movements in a number of U.S. cities have pushed for a higher minimum wage, which they call a **living wage**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis}. Promoters of living wage laws maintain that the minimum wage is too low to ensure a reasonable standard of living. They base this conclusion on the calculation that, if you work 40 hours a week at a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour for 50 weeks a year, your annual income is $14,500, which is less than the official U.S. government definition of what it means for a family to be in poverty. (A family with two adults earning minimum wage and two young children will find it more cost efficient for one parent to provide childcare while the other works for income. So the family income would be $14,500, which is significantly lower than the federal poverty line for a family of four, which was $23,850 in 2014.)\n\nSupporters of the living wage argue that full-time workers should be assured a high enough wage so that they can afford the essentials of life: food, clothing, shelter, and healthcare. Since Baltimore passed the first living wage law in 1994, several dozen cities enacted similar laws in the late 1990s and the 2000s. The living wage ordinances do not apply to all employers, but they have specified that all employees of the city or employees of firms that are hired by the city be paid at least a certain wage that is usually a few dollars per hour above the U.S. minimum wage.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_004) illustrates the situation of a city considering a living wage law. For simplicity, we assume that there is no federal minimum wage. The wage appears on the vertical axis, because the wage is the price in the labor market. Before the passage of the living wage law, the equilibrium wage is $10 per hour and the city hires 1,200 workers at this wage. However, a group of concerned citizens persuades the city council to enact a living wage law requiring employers to pay no less than $12 per hour. In response to the higher wage, 1,600 workers look for jobs with the city. At this higher wage, the city, as an employer, is willing to hire only 700 workers. At the price floor, the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, and a surplus of labor exists in this market. For workers who continue to have a job at a higher salary, life has improved. For those who were willing to work at the old wage rate but lost their jobs with the wage increase, life has not improved.

About 1% of American workers are actually paid the minimum wage. In other words, the vast majority of the U.S. labor force has its wages determined in the labor market, not as a result of the government price floor. But for workers with low skills and little experience, like those without a high school diploma or teenagers, the minimum wage is quite important. In many cities, the federal minimum wage is apparently below the market price for unskilled labor, because employers offer more than the minimum wage to checkout clerks and other low-skill workers without any government prodding.\n\nEconomists have attempted to estimate how much the minimum wage reduces the quantity demanded of low-skill labor. A typical result of such studies is that a 10% increase in the minimum wage would decrease the hiring of unskilled workers by 1 to 2%, which seems a relatively small reduction. In fact, some studies have even found no effect of a higher minimum wage on employment at certain times and places\u2014although these studies are controversial.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the minimum wage lies just slightly *below* the equilibrium wage level. Wages could fluctuate according to market forces above this price floor, but they would not be allowed to move beneath the floor. In this situation, the price floor minimum wage is said to be *nonbinding* \u2014that is, the price floor is not determining the market outcome. Even if the minimum wage moves just a little higher, it will still have no effect on the quantity of employment in the economy, as long as it remains below the equilibrium wage. Even if the minimum wage is increased by enough so that it rises slightly above the equilibrium wage and becomes binding, there will be only a small excess supply gap between the quantity demanded and quantity supplied.\n\nThese insights help to explain why U.S. minimum wage laws have historically had only a small impact on employment. Since the minimum wage has typically been set close to the equilibrium wage for low-skill labor and sometimes even below it, it has not had a large effect in creating an excess supply of labor. However, if the minimum wage were increased dramatically\u2014say, if it were doubled to match the living wages that some U.S. cities have considered\u2014then its impact on reducing the quantity demanded of employment would be far greater. The following Clear It Up feature describes in greater detail some of the arguments for and against changes to minimum wage.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the harm in raising the minimum wage?\n\nBecause of the law of demand, a higher required wage will reduce the amount of low-skill employment either in terms of employees or in terms of work hours. Although there is controversy over the numbers, let\u2019s say for the sake of the argument that a 10% rise in the minimum wage will reduce the employment of low-skill workers by 2%. Does this outcome mean that raising the minimum wage by 10% is bad public policy? Not necessarily.\n\nIf 98% of those receiving the minimum wage have a pay increase of 10%, but 2% of those receiving the minimum wage lose their jobs, are the gains for society as a whole greater than the losses? The answer is not clear, because job losses, even for a small group, may cause more pain than modest income gains for others. For one thing, we need to consider which minimum wage workers are losing their jobs. If the 2% of minimum wage workers who lose their jobs are struggling to support families, that is one thing. If those who lose their job are high school students picking up spending money over summer vacation, that is something else.\n\nAnother complexity is that many minimum wage workers do not work full-time for an entire year. Imagine a minimum wage worker who holds different part-time jobs for a few months at a time, with bouts of unemployment in between. The worker in this situation receives the 10% raise in the minimum wage when working, but also ends up working 2% fewer hours during the year because the higher minimum wage reduces how much employers want people to work. Overall, this worker\u2019s income would rise because the 10% pay raise would more than offset the 2% fewer hours worked.\n\nOf course, these arguments do not prove that raising the minimum wage is necessarily a good idea either. There may well be other, better public policy options for helping low-wage workers. (The [Poverty and Economic Inequality](/m48681){: .target-chapter} chapter discusses some possibilities.) The lesson from this maze of minimum wage arguments is that complex social problems rarely have simple answers. Even those who agree on how a proposed economic policy affects quantity demanded and quantity supplied may still disagree on whether the policy is a good idea.\n\n\n\n### Concepts and Summary\n\nIn the labor market, households are on the supply side of the market and firms are on the demand side. In the market for financial capital, households and firms can be on either side of the market: they are suppliers of financial capital when they save or make financial investments, and demanders of financial capital when they borrow or receive financial investments.\n\nIn the demand and supply analysis of labor markets, the price can be measured by the annual salary or hourly wage received. The quantity of labor can be measured in various ways, like number of workers or the number of hours worked.\n\nFactors that can shift the demand curve for labor include: a change in the quantity demanded of the product that the labor produces; a change in the production process that uses more or less labor; and a change in government policy that affects the quantity of labor that firms wish to hire at a given wage. Demand can also increase or decrease (shift) in response to: workers\u2019 level of education and training, technology, the number of companies, and availability and price of other inputs.\n\nThe main factors that can shift the supply curve for labor are: how desirable a job appears to workers relative to the alternatives, government policy that either restricts or encourages the quantity of workers trained for the job, the number of workers in the economy, and required education.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIn the labor market, what causes a movement along the demand curve? What causes a shift in the demand curve?\n\n\n\nChanges in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along the demand curve. A change in anything else that affects demand for labor (e.g., changes in output, changes in the production process that use more or less labor, government regulation) causes a shift in the demand curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the labor market, what causes a movement along the supply curve? What causes a shift in the supply curve?\n\n\n\nChanges in the wage rate (the price of labor) cause a movement along the supply curve. A change in anything else that affects supply of labor (e.g., changes in how desirable the job is perceived to be, government policy to promote training in the field) causes a shift in the supply curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is a living wage considered a price floor? Does imposing a living wage have the same outcome as a minimum wage?\n\n\n\nSince a living wage is a suggested minimum wage, it acts like a price floor (assuming, of course, that it is followed). If the living wage is binding, it will cause an excess supply of labor at that wage rate.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the \u201cprice\u201d commonly called in the labor market?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre households demanders or suppliers in the goods market? Are firms demanders or suppliers in the goods market? What about the labor market and the financial market?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName some factors that can cause a shift in the demand curve in labor markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName some factors that can cause a shift in the supply curve in labor markets.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nOther than the demand for labor, what would be another example of a \u201cderived demand?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that a 5% increase in the minimum wage causes a 5% reduction in employment. How would this affect employers and how would it affect workers? In your opinion, would this be a good policy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat assumption is made for a minimum wage to be a nonbinding price floor? What assumption is made for a living wage price floor to be binding?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nIdentify each of the following as involving either demand or supply.

Where did that savings go and what was it used for? Some of the savings ended up in banks, which in turn loaned the money to individuals or businesses that wanted to borrow money. Some was invested in private companies or loaned to government agencies that wanted to borrow money to raise funds for purposes like building roads or mass transit. Some firms reinvested their savings in their own businesses.\n\nIn this section, we will determine how the demand and supply model links those who wish to supply **financial capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} (i.e., savings) with those who demand financial capital (i.e., borrowing). Those who save money (or make financial investments, which is the same thing), whether individuals or businesses, are on the supply side of the financial market. Those who borrow money are on the demand side of the financial market. For a more detailed treatment of the different kinds of financial investments like bank accounts, stocks and bonds, see the [Financial Markets](/m48697) chapter.\n\n### Who Demands and Who Supplies in Financial Markets?\n\nIn any market, the price is what suppliers receive and what demanders pay. In financial markets, those who supply financial capital through saving expect to receive a rate of return, while those who demand financial capital by receiving funds expect to pay a rate of return. This rate of return can come in a variety of forms, depending on the type of investment.\n\nThe simplest example of a rate of return is the **interest rate**{: data-type=\"term\"}. For example, when you supply money into a savings account at a bank, you receive interest on your deposit. The interest paid to you as a percent of your deposits is the interest rate. Similarly, if you demand a loan to buy a car or a computer, you will need to pay interest on the money you borrow.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the market for borrowing money with credit cards. In 2014, almost 200 million Americans were cardholders. Credit cards allow you to borrow money from the card\\'s issuer, and pay back the borrowed amount plus interest, though most allow you a period of time in which you can repay the loan without paying interest. A typical credit card interest rate ranges from 12% to 18% per year. In 2014, Americans had about $793 billion outstanding in credit card debts. About half of U.S. families with credit cards report that they almost always pay the full balance on time, but one-quarter of U.S. families with credit cards say that they \u201chardly ever\u201d pay off the card in full. In fact, in 2014, 56% of consumers carried an unpaid balance in the last 12 months. Let\u2019s say that, on average, the annual interest rate for credit card borrowing is 15% per year. So, Americans pay tens of billions of dollars every year in interest on their credit cards\u2014plus basic fees for the credit card or fees for late payments.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_005) illustrates demand and supply in the financial market for credit cards. The horizontal axis of the financial market shows the quantity of money that is loaned or borrowed in this market. The vertical or price axis shows the rate of return, which in the case of credit card borrowing can be measured with an interest rate. [\\[link\\]](#Table_04_05) shows the quantity of financial capital that consumers demand at various interest rates and the quantity that credit card firms (often banks) are willing to supply.\n\n  for borrowing financial capital intersects the supply curve (S) for lending financial capital at equilibrium &#x20AC;. At the equilibrium, the interest rate (the &#x201C;price&#x201D; in this market) is 15% and the quantity of financial capital being loaned and borrowed is $600 billion. The equilibrium price is where the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied are equal. At an above-equilibrium interest rate like 21%, the quantity of financial capital supplied would increase to $750 billion, but the quantity demanded would decrease to $480 billion. At a below-equilibrium interest rate like 13%, the quantity of financial capital demanded would increase to $700 billion, but the quantity of financial capital supplied would decrease to $510 billion.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C04_005 data-title=\"Demand and Supply for Borrowing Money with Credit Cards \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_04_05\" summary=\"This table has three columns and six rows.

According to the **law of demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis}, a higher rate of return (that is, a higher price) will decrease the quantity demanded. As the interest rate rises, consumers will reduce the quantity that they borrow. According to the law of supply, a higher price increases the quantity supplied. Consequently, as the interest rate paid on credit card borrowing rises, more firms will be eager to issue credit cards and to encourage customers to use them. Conversely, if the interest rate on credit cards falls, the quantity of financial capital supplied in the credit card market will decrease and the quantity demanded will fall.\n\n### Equilibrium in Financial Markets\n\nIn the financial market for credit cards shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_005), the supply curve (S) and the demand curve (D) cross at the equilibrium point (E). The equilibrium occurs at an interest rate of 15%, where the quantity of funds demanded and the quantity supplied are equal at an equilibrium quantity of $600 billion.\n\nIf the interest rate (remember, this measures the \u201cprice\u201d in the financial market) is above the equilibrium level, then an excess supply, or a surplus, of financial capital will arise in this market. For example, at an interest rate of 21%, the quantity of funds supplied increases to $750 billion, while the quantity demanded decreases to $480 billion. At this above-equilibrium interest rate, firms are eager to supply loans to credit card borrowers, but relatively few people or businesses wish to borrow. As a result, some credit card firms will lower the interest rates (or other fees) they charge to attract more business. This strategy will push the interest rate down toward the equilibrium level.\n\nIf the interest rate is below the equilibrium, then excess demand or a shortage of funds occurs in this market. At an interest rate of 13%, the quantity of funds credit card borrowers demand increases to $700 billion; but the quantity credit card firms are willing to supply is only $510 billion. In this situation, credit card firms will perceive that they are overloaded with eager borrowers and conclude that they have an opportunity to raise interest rates or fees. The interest rate will face economic pressures to creep up toward the equilibrium level.\n\n### Shifts in Demand and Supply in Financial Markets\n\nThose who supply financial capital face two broad decisions: how much to save, and how to divide up their savings among different forms of financial investments. We will discuss each of these in turn.\n\nParticipants in financial markets must decide when they prefer to consume goods: now or in the future. Economists call this **intertemporal decision making**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} because it involves decisions across time. Unlike a decision about what to buy from the grocery store, decisions about investment or saving are made across a period of time, sometimes a long period.\n\nMost workers save for retirement because their income in the present is greater than their needs, while the opposite will be true once they retire. So they save today and supply financial markets. If their income increases, they save more. If their perceived situation in the future changes, they change the amount of their saving. For example, there is some evidence that Social Security, the program that workers pay into in order to qualify for government checks after retirement, has tended to reduce the quantity of financial capital that workers save. If this is true, Social Security has shifted the supply of financial capital at any interest rate to the left.\n\nBy contrast, many college students need money today when their income is low (or nonexistent) to pay their college expenses. As a result, they borrow today and demand from financial markets. Once they graduate and become employed, they will pay back the loans. Individuals borrow money to purchase homes or cars. A business seeks financial investment so that it has the funds to build a factory or invest in a research and development project that will not pay off for five years, ten years, or even more. So when consumers and businesses have greater confidence that they will be able to repay in the future, the quantity demanded of financial capital at any given interest rate will shift to the right.\n\nFor example, in the technology boom of the late 1990s, many businesses became extremely confident that investments in new technology would have a high rate of return, and their demand for financial capital shifted to the right. Conversely, during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009, their demand for financial capital at any given interest rate shifted to the left.\n\nTo this point, we have been looking at saving in total. Now let us consider what affects saving in different types of financial investments. In deciding between different forms of financial investments, suppliers of financial capital will have to consider the rates of return and the risks involved. Rate of return is a positive attribute of investments, but risk is a negative. If Investment A becomes more risky, or the return diminishes, then savers will shift their funds to Investment B\u2014and the supply curve of financial capital for Investment A will shift back to the left while the supply curve of capital for Investment B shifts to the right.\n\n### The United States as a Global Borrower\n\nIn the global economy, trillions of dollars of financial investment cross national borders every year. In the early 2000s, financial investors from foreign countries were investing several hundred billion dollars per year more in the U.S. economy than U.S. financial investors were investing abroad. The following Work It Out deals with one of the macroeconomic concerns for the U.S. economy in recent years.\n\n\n\nThe Effect of Growing U.S. Debt\n\nImagine that the U.S. economy became viewed as a less desirable place for foreign investors to put their money because of fears about the growth of the U.S. public debt. Using the four-step process for analyzing how changes in supply and demand affect equilibrium outcomes, how would increased U.S. public debt affect the equilibrium price and quantity for capital in U.S. financial markets?\n\nStep 1. Draw a diagram showing demand and supply for financial capital that represents the original scenario in which foreign investors are pouring money into the U.S. economy. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_014) shows a demand curve, D, and a supply curve, S, where the supply of capital includes the funds arriving from foreign investors. The original equilibrium E<sub>0</sub> occurs at interest rate R<sub>0</sub> and quantity of financial investment Q<sub>0</sub>.\n\n occurs at an equilibrium rate of return (R0) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q0.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C04_014 data-title=\"The United States as a Global Borrower Before U.S. Debt Uncertainty \"}\n\n\nStep 2. Will the diminished confidence in the U.S. economy as a place to invest affect demand or supply of financial capital? Yes, it will affect supply. Many foreign investors look to the U.S. financial markets to store their money in safe financial vehicles with low risk and stable returns. As the U.S. debt increases, debt servicing will increase\u2014that is, more current income will be used to pay the interest rate on past debt. Increasing U.S. debt also means that businesses may have to pay higher interest rates to borrow money, because business is now competing with the government for financial resources.\n\nStep 3. Will supply increase or decrease? When the enthusiasm of foreign investors\u2019 for investing their money in the U.S. economy diminishes, the supply of financial capital shifts to the left. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_006) shows the supply curve shift from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>.\n\n occurs at an equilibrium rate of return (R0) and the equilibrium quantity is at Q0.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C04_006 data-title=\"The United States as a Global Borrower Before and After U.S. Debt Uncertainty \"}\n\n\nStep 4. Thus, foreign investors\u2019 diminished enthusiasm leads to a new equilibrium, E<sub>1</sub>, which occurs at the higher interest rate, R<sub>1</sub>, and the lower quantity of financial investment, Q<sub>1</sub>.\n\n\n\nThe economy has experienced an enormous inflow of foreign capital. According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, by the third quarter of 2014, U.S. investors had accumulated $24.6 trillion of foreign assets, but foreign investors owned a total of $30.8 trillion of U.S. assets. If foreign investors were to pull their money out of the U.S. economy and invest elsewhere in the world, the result could be a significantly lower quantity of financial investment in the United States, available only at a higher interest rate. This reduced inflow of foreign financial investment could impose hardship on U.S. consumers and firms interested in borrowing.\n\nIn a modern, developed economy, financial capital often moves invisibly through electronic transfers between one bank account and another. Yet these flows of funds can be analyzed with the same tools of demand and supply as markets for goods or labor.\n\n### Price Ceilings in Financial Markets: Usury Laws\n\nAs we noted earlier, about 200 million Americans own credit cards, and their interest payments and fees total tens of billions of dollars each year. It is little wonder that political pressures sometimes arise for setting limits on the interest rates or fees that credit card companies charge. The firms that issue credit cards, including banks, oil companies, phone companies, and retail stores, respond that the higher interest rates are necessary to cover the losses created by those who borrow on their credit cards and who do not repay on time or at all. These companies also point out that cardholders can avoid paying interest if they pay their bills on time.\n\nConsider the credit card market as illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_007). In this financial market, the vertical axis shows the interest rate (which is the price in the financial market). Demanders in the credit card market are households and businesses; suppliers are the companies that issue credit cards. This figure does not use specific numbers, which would be hypothetical in any case, but instead focuses on the underlying economic relationships. Imagine a law imposes a price ceiling that holds the interest rate charged on credit cards at the rate Rc, which lies below the interest rate R<sub>0</sub> that would otherwise have prevailed in the market. The price ceiling is shown by the horizontal dashed line in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_007). The demand and supply model predicts that at the lower price ceiling interest rate, the quantity demanded of credit card debt will increase from its original level of Q<sub>0</sub> to Qd; however, the quantity supplied of credit card debt will decrease from the original Q<sub>0</sub> to Qs. At the price ceiling (Rc), quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied. Consequently, a number of people who want to have credit cards and are willing to pay the prevailing interest rate will find that companies are unwilling to issue cards to them. The result will be a credit shortage.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C04_007 data-title=\"Credit Card Interest Rates: Another Price Ceiling Example \"}\n\nMany states do have **usury laws**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which impose an upper limit on the interest rate that lenders can charge. However, in many cases these upper limits are well above the market interest rate. For example, if the interest rate is not allowed to rise above 30% per year, it can still fluctuate below that level according to market forces. A price ceiling that is set at a relatively high level is nonbinding, and it will have no practical effect unless the equilibrium price soars high enough to exceed the price ceiling.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nIn the demand and supply analysis of financial markets, the \u201cprice\u201d is the rate of return or the interest rate received. The quantity is measured by the money that flows from those who supply financial capital to those who demand it.\n\nTwo factors can shift the supply of financial capital to a certain investment: if people want to alter their existing levels of consumption, and if the riskiness or return on one investment changes relative to other investments. Factors that can shift demand for capital include business confidence and consumer confidence in the future\u2014since financial investments received in the present are typically repaid in the future.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIn the financial market, what causes a movement along the demand curve? What causes a shift in the demand curve?\n\n\n\nChanges in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital) cause a movement along the demand curve. A change in anything else (non-price variable) that affects demand for financial capital (e.g., changes in confidence about the future, changes in needs for borrowing) would shift the demand curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the financial market, what causes a movement along the supply curve? What causes a shift in the supply curve?\n\n\n\nChanges in the interest rate (i.e., the price of financial capital) cause a movement along the supply curve. A change in anything else that affects the supply of financial capital (a non-price variable) such as income or future needs would shift the supply curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a usury law limits interest rates to no more than 35%, what would the likely impact be on the amount of loans made and interest rates paid?\n\n\n\nIf market interest rates stay in their normal range, an interest rate limit of 35% would not be binding. If the equilibrium interest rate rose above 35%, the interest rate would be capped at that rate, and the quantity of loans would be lower than the equilibrium quantity, causing a shortage of loans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following changes in the financial market will lead to a decline in interest rates:\n\n1.  a rise in demand\n2.  a fall in demand\n3.  a rise in supply\n4.  a fall in supply\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\nb and c will lead to a fall in interest rates.

What would be the likely impact on U.S. financial markets as part of the global economy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the government imposed a federal interest rate ceiling of 20% on all loans, who would gain and who would lose?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nPredict how each of the following economic changes will affect the equilibrium price and quantity in the financial market for home loans.

In all of these markets, prices serve as a remarkable social mechanism for collecting, combining, and transmitting information that is relevant to the market\u2014namely, the relationship between demand and supply\u2014and then serving as messengers to convey that information to buyers and sellers. In a market-oriented economy, no government agency or guiding intelligence oversees the set of responses and interconnections that result from a change in price. Instead, each consumer reacts according to that person\u2019s preferences and budget set, and each profit-seeking producer reacts to the impact on its expected profits. The following Clear It Up feature examines the **demand and supply models**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis}.\n\n\n\nWhy are demand and supply curves important?\n\nThe demand and supply model is the second fundamental diagram for this course. (The opportunity set model introduced in the [Choice in a World of Scarcity](/m48602){: .target-chapter} chapter was the first.) Just as it would be foolish to try to learn the arithmetic of long division by memorizing every possible combination of numbers that can be divided by each other, it would be foolish to try to memorize every specific example of demand and supply in this chapter, this textbook, or this course. Demand and supply is not primarily a list of examples; it is a model to analyze prices and quantities. Even though demand and supply diagrams have many labels, they are fundamentally the same in their logic. Your goal should be to understand the underlying model so you can use it to analyze *any* market.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_008) displays a generic demand and supply curve. The horizontal axis shows the different measures of quantity: a quantity of a good or service, or a quantity of labor for a given job, or a quantity of financial capital. The vertical axis shows a measure of price: the price of a good or service, the wage in the labor market, or the rate of return (like the interest rate) in the financial market.\n\nThe demand and supply model can explain the existing levels of prices, wages, and rates of return. To carry out such an analysis, think about the quantity that will be demanded at each price and the quantity that will be supplied at each price\u2014that is, think about the shape of the demand and supply curves\u2014and how these forces will combine to produce equilibrium.\n\nDemand and supply can also be used to explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return. There are only four possibilities: the change in any single event may cause the demand curve to shift right or to shift left; or it may cause the supply curve to shift right or to shift left. The key to analyzing the effect of an economic event on equilibrium prices and quantities is to determine which of these four possibilities occurred. The way to do this correctly is to think back to the list of factors that shift the demand and supply curves. Note that if more than one variable is changing at the same time, the overall impact will depend on the degree of the shifts; when there are multiple variables, economists isolate each change and analyze it independently.\n\n in the financial market. The demand and supply curves can be used to explain how economic events will cause changes in prices, wages, and rates of return.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C04_008 data-title=\"Demand and Supply Curves \"}\n\n\n\n\nAn increase in the price of some product signals consumers that there is a shortage and the product should perhaps be economized on. For example, if you are thinking about taking a plane trip to Hawaii, but the ticket turns out to be expensive during the week you intend to go, you might consider other weeks when the ticket might be cheaper. The price could be high because you were planning to travel during a holiday when demand for traveling is high. Or, maybe the cost of an input like jet fuel increased or the airline has raised the price temporarily to see how many people are willing to pay it. Perhaps all of these factors are present at the same time. You do not need to analyze the market and break down the price change into its underlying factors. You just have to look at the price of a ticket and decide whether and when to fly.\n\nIn the same way, price changes provide useful information to producers. Imagine the situation of a farmer who grows oats and learns that the price of oats has risen. The higher price could be due to an increase in demand caused by a new scientific study proclaiming that eating oats is especially healthful. Or perhaps the price of a substitute grain, like corn, has risen, and people have responded by buying more oats. But the oat farmer does not need to know the details. The farmer only needs to know that the price of oats has risen and that it will be profitable to expand production as a result.\n\nThe actions of individual consumers and producers as they react to prices overlap and interlock in markets for goods, labor, and financial capital. A change in any single market is transmitted through these multiple interconnections to other markets. The vision of the role of flexible prices helping markets to reach equilibrium and linking different markets together helps to explain why **price controls**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} can be so counterproductive. Price controls are government laws that serve to regulate prices rather than allow the various markets to determine prices. There is an old proverb: \u201cDon\u2019t kill the messenger.\u201d In ancient times, messengers carried information between distant cities and kingdoms. When they brought bad news, there was an emotional impulse to kill the messenger. But killing the messenger did not kill the bad news. Moreover, killing the messenger had an undesirable side effect: Other messengers would refuse to bring news to that city or kingdom, depriving its citizens of vital information.\n\nThose who seek price controls are trying to kill the messenger\u2014or at least to stifle an unwelcome message that prices are bringing about the equilibrium level of price and quantity. But price controls do nothing to affect the underlying forces of demand and supply, and this can have serious repercussions. During China\u2019s \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d in the late 1950s, food prices were kept artificially low, with the result that 30 to 40 million people died of starvation because the low prices depressed farm production. Changes in demand and supply will continue to reveal themselves through consumers\u2019 and producers\u2019 behavior. Immobilizing the price messenger through price controls will deprive everyone in the economy of critical information. Without this information, it becomes difficult for everyone\u2014buyers and sellers alike\u2014to react in a flexible and appropriate manner as changes occur throughout the economy.\n\n\n\nBaby Boomers Come of Age\n\nThe theory of supply and demand can explain what happens in the labor markets and suggests that the demand for nurses will increase as healthcare needs of baby boomers increase, as [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_015) shows. The impact of that increase will result in an average salary higher than the $67,930 earned in 2012 referenced in the first part of this case. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) will be at the new equilibrium price (Pe<sub>1</sub>).Equilibrium quantity will also increase from Qe<sub>0</sub> to Qe<sub>1</sub>.\n\n and the equilibrium quantity of nurses increases from Qe0 to Qe1. The equilibrium salary increases from Pe0 to Pe1.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C04_015 data-title=\"Impact of Increasing Demand for Nurses 2012-2022\"}\n\n\nSuppose that as the demand for nurses increases, the supply shrinks due to an increasing number of nurses entering retirement and increases in the tuition of nursing degrees. The impact of a decreasing supply of nurses is captured by the leftward shift of the supply curve in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C04_016) The shifts in the two curves result in higher salaries for nurses, but the overall impact in the quantity of nurses is uncertain, as it depends on the relative shifts of supply and demand.\n\n, causes a leftward shift of the supply curve resulting in even higher salaries for nurses, at Pe2, but an uncertain outcome for the equilibrium quantity of nurses, which in this representation is less than Qe1, but more than the initial Qe0.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C04_016 data-title=\"Impact of Decreasing Supply of Nurses between 2012 and 2022\"}\n\n\nWhile we do not know if the number of nurses will increase or decrease relative to their initial employment, we know they will have higher salaries. The situation of the labor market for nurses described in the beginning of the chapter is different from this example, because instead of a shrinking supply, we had the supply growing at a lower rate than the growth in demand. Since both curves were shifting to the right, we would have an unequivocal increase in the quantity of nurses. And because the shift in the demand curve was larger than the one in the supply, we would expect higher wages as a result.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe market price system provides a highly efficient mechanism for disseminating information about relative scarcities of goods, services, labor, and financial capital. Market participants do not need to know why prices have changed, only that the changes require them to revisit previous decisions they made about supply and demand. Price controls hide information about the true scarcity of products and thereby cause misallocation of resources.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIdentify the most accurate statement.

Instead of $3 for a cup of coffee, you will now be charged $2 for coffee, $1 for creamer, and $1 for your choice of sweetener. If you pay your usual $3 for a cup of coffee, you must choose between creamer and sweetener. If you want both, you now face an extra charge of $1. Sound absurd? Well, that is the situation Netflix customers found themselves in\u2014a 60% price hike to retain the same service in 2011.\n\nIn early 2011, Netflix consumers paid about $10 a month for a package consisting of streaming video and DVD rentals. In July 2011, the company announced a packaging change. Customers wishing to retain both streaming video and DVD rental would be charged $15.98 per month, a price increase of about 60%. In 2014, Netflix also raised its streaming video subscription price from $7.99 to $8.99 per month for new U.S. customers. The company also changed its policy of 4K streaming content from $9.00 to $12.00 per month that year.\n\nHow would customers of the 18-year-old firm react? Would they abandon Netflix? Would the ease of access to other venues make a difference in how consumers responded to the Netflix price change? The answers to those questions will be explored in this chapter: the change in quantity with respect to a change in price, a concept economists call elasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Elasticity\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Price Elasticity of Demand and Price Elasticity of Supply\n* Polar Cases of Elasticity and Constant Elasticity\n* Elasticity and Pricing\n* Elasticity in Areas Other Than Price\n\n\n\nAnyone who has studied economics knows the law of demand: a higher price will lead to a lower quantity demanded. What you may not know is how much lower the quantity demanded will be. Similarly, the law of supply shows that a higher price will lead to a higher quantity supplied. The question is: How much higher? This chapter will explain how to answer these questions and why they are critically important in the real world.\n\nTo find answers to these questions, we need to understand the concept of elasticity. **Elasticity**{: data-type=\"term\"} is an economics concept that measures responsiveness of one variable to changes in another variable. Suppose you drop two items from a second-floor balcony. The first item is a tennis ball. The second item is a brick. Which will bounce higher? Obviously, the tennis ball. We would say that the tennis ball has greater elasticity.\n\nConsider an economic example. Cigarette taxes are an example of a \u201csin tax,\u201d a tax on something that is bad for you, like alcohol. Cigarettes are taxed at the state and national levels. State taxes range from a low of 17 cents per pack in Missouri to $4.35 per pack in New York. The average state cigarette tax is $1.51 per pack. The 2014 federal tax rate on cigarettes was $1.01 per pack, but in 2015 the Obama Administration proposed raising the federal tax nearly a dollar to $1.95 per pack. The key question is: How much would cigarette purchases decline?\n\nTaxes on cigarettes serve two purposes: to raise tax revenue for government and to discourage consumption of cigarettes. However, if a higher cigarette tax discourages consumption by quite a lot, meaning a greatly reduced quantity of cigarettes is sold, then the cigarette tax on each pack will not raise much revenue for the government. Alternatively, a higher cigarette tax that does not discourage consumption by much will actually raise more tax revenue for the government. Thus, when a government agency tries to calculate the effects of altering its cigarette tax, it must analyze how much the tax affects the quantity of cigarettes consumed. This issue reaches beyond governments and taxes; every firm faces a similar issue. Every time a firm considers raising the price that it charges, it must consider how much a price increase will reduce the quantity demanded of what it sells. Conversely, when a firm puts its products on sale, it must expect (or hope) that the lower price will lead to a significantly higher quantity demanded.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

The **price elasticity of demand**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the percentage change in the quantity *demanded* of a good or service divided by the percentage change in the price. The **price elasticity of supply**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the percentage change in quantity *supplied* divided by the percentage change in price.\n\nElasticities can be usefully divided into three broad categories: elastic, inelastic, and unitary. An **elastic demand**{: data-type=\"term\"} or **elastic supply**{: data-type=\"term\"} is one in which the elasticity is greater than one, indicating a high responsiveness to changes in price. Elasticities that are less than one indicate low responsiveness to price changes and correspond to **inelastic demand**{: data-type=\"term\"} or **inelastic supply**{: data-type=\"term\"}. **Unitary elasticities**{: data-type=\"term\"} indicate proportional responsiveness of either demand or supply, as summarized in [\\[link\\]](#Table_05_01).\n\n<table id=\"Table_05_01\" summary=\"If percentage change in quantity is greater than percentage change in price then percentage change in quantity divided by percentage change in price is greater than 1, and it is called &#x201C;Elastic.&#x201D; If percentage change in quantity is equal to percentage change in price then percentage change in quantity divided by percentage change in price is equal to 1, and it is called &#x201C;Unitary.&#x201D; If percentage change in quantity is less than percentage change in price then percentage change in quantity divided by percentage change in price is less than 1, and it is called &#x201C;Inelastic.&#x201D;\"><caption>Elastic, Inelastic, and Unitary: Three Cases of Elasticity</caption><thead>\n<tr>\n\t<th>If . . .</th>\n\t<th>Then . . .</th>\n\t<th>And It Is Called . . .</th>\n\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity</mtext><mo>&gt;</mo><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0price</mtext></math></td>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mfrac><mrow><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0price</mtext></mrow></mfrac><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>1</mn></math></td>\n          <td> Elastic </td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0price</mtext></math></td>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mfrac><mrow><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0price</mtext></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></math></td>\n          <td> Unitary </td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity</mtext><mo>&lt;</mo><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0price</mtext></math></td>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mfrac><mrow><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0price</mtext></mrow></mfrac><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>1</mn></math></td>\n          <td> Inelastic </td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody></table>\n\n\nBefore we get into the nitty gritty of elasticity, enjoy this [article][1] on elasticity and ticket prices at the Super Bowl.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nTo calculate elasticity, instead of using simple percentage changes in quantity and price, economists use the average percent change in both quantity and price. This is called the Midpoint Method for Elasticity, and is represented in the following equations:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>% change in quantity</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Q</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2013</mo><mo /><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Q</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><mfenced><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Q</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mo> </mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Q</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></mfenced><mn>/2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mn>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>% change in price</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>\u2013</mo><mo> </mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><mfenced><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>+</mo><mo> </mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">P</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow></mfenced><mn>/2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mn>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo> </mo></math>\n\n\nThe advantage of the is **Midpoint Method**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is that one obtains the same elasticity between two price points whether there is a price increase or decrease. This is because the formula uses the same base for both cases.\n\n### Calculating Price Elasticity of Demand\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the elasticity between points A and B and between points G and H shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_003).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C05_003 data-title=\"Calculating the Price Elasticity of Demand \"}\n\nFirst, apply the formula to calculate the elasticity as price decreases from $70 at point B to $60 at point A:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>%\u00a0change in quantity</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mn>3,000</mn><mo>\u2013</mo><mn>2,800</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>3,000</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>2,800</mn><mo>)</mo><mo>/2</mo></mrow></mfrac><mn>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mn>200</mn><mn>2,900</mn></mfrac><mn>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>6.9</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>% change in price</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mn>60</mn><mo>\u2013</mo><mn>70</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>60</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>70</mn><mo>)</mo><mn>/2</mn></mrow></mfrac><mn>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mn>\u201310</mn></mrow><mn>65</mn></mfrac><mn>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>\u201315.4</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Price Elasticity of Demand</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mn>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.9%</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>\u201315.4%</mn></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>0.45</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nTherefore, the elasticity of demand between these two points is <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mfrac><mrow><mn>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06.9%</mn></mrow><mrow><mo /><mn>\u201315.4%</mn></mrow></mfrac></math>\n\n which is 0.45, an amount smaller than one, showing that the demand is inelastic in this interval. Price elasticities of demand are *always* negative since price and quantity demanded always move in opposite directions (on the demand curve). By convention, we always talk about elasticities as positive numbers. So mathematically, we take the absolute value of the result. We will ignore this detail from now on, while remembering to interpret elasticities as positive numbers.\n\nThis means that, along the demand curve between point B and A, if the price changes by 1%, the quantity demanded will change by 0.45%. A change in the price will result in a smaller percentage change in the quantity demanded. For example, a 10% *increase* in the price will result in only a 4.5% *decrease* in quantity demanded. A 10% *decrease* in the price will result in only a 4.5% *increase* in the quantity demanded. Price elasticities of demand are negative numbers indicating that the demand curve is downward sloping, but are read as absolute values. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through calculating the price elasticity of demand.\n\n\n\nFinding the Price Elasticity of Demand\n\nCalculate the price elasticity of demand using the data in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_003) for an increase in price from G to H. Has the elasticity increased or decreased?\n\nStep 1.

The magnitude of the elasticity has increased (in absolute value) as we moved up along the **demand curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} from points A to B. Recall that the elasticity between these two points was 0.45. Demand was inelastic between points A and B and elastic between points G and H. This shows us that price elasticity of demand changes at different points along a **straight-line demand curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\n\n\n### Calculating the Price Elasticity of Supply\n\nAssume that an apartment rents for $650 per month and at that price 10,000 units are rented as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_023). When the price increases to $700 per month, 13,000 units are supplied into the market. By what percentage does apartment supply increase? What is the price sensitivity?\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C05_023 data-title=\"Price Elasticity of Supply \"}\n\nUsing the **Midpoint Method**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis},\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mn>13,000</mn><mo>\u2013</mo><mn>10,000</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>13,000</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>10,000</mn><mo>)/2</mo></mrow></mfrac><mn>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mn>3,000</mn><mn>11,500</mn></mfrac><mn>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>26.1</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0price</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mn>$700</mn><mo>\u2013</mo><mn>$600</mn></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo><mn>$700</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>$650</mn><mo>)/2</mo></mrow></mfrac><mn>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mn>50</mn><mn>675</mn></mfrac><mn>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>7.4</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Price\u00a0Elasticity\u00a0of\u00a0Supply</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mn>26.1%</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>\u00a0\u00a07.4%</mn></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>3.53</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nAgain, as with the elasticity of demand, the elasticity of supply is not followed by any units. Elasticity is a ratio of one percentage change to another percentage change\u2014nothing more\u2014and is read as an absolute value. In this case, a 1% rise in price causes an increase in quantity supplied of 3.5%. The greater than one elasticity of supply means that the percentage change in quantity supplied will be greater than a one percent price change. If you\\'re starting to wonder if the concept of slope fits into this calculation, read the following Clear It Up box.\n\n\n\nIs the elasticity the slope?\n\nIt is a common mistake to confuse the slope of either the supply or demand curve with its elasticity. The slope is the rate of change in units along the curve, or the rise/run (change in y over the change in x). For example, in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_003), each point shown on the demand curve, price drops by $10 and the number of units demanded increases by 200. So the slope is \u201310/200 along the entire demand curve and does not change. The price elasticity, however, changes along the curve. Elasticity between points A and B was 0.45 and increased to 1.47 between points G and H. Elasticity is the *percentage* change, which is a different calculation from the slope and has a different meaning.\n\nWhen we are at the upper end of a demand curve, where price is high and the quantity demanded is low, a small change in the quantity demanded, even in, say, one unit, is pretty big in percentage terms. A change in price of, say, a dollar, is going to be much less important in percentage terms than it would have been at the bottom of the demand curve. Likewise, at the bottom of the demand curve, that one unit change when the quantity demanded is high will be small as a percentage.\n\nSo, at one end of the demand curve, where we have a large percentage change in quantity demanded over a small percentage change in price, the elasticity value would be high, or demand would be relatively elastic. Even with the same change in the price and the same change in the quantity demanded, at the other end of the demand curve the quantity is much higher, and the price is much lower, so the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller and the percentage change in price is much higher. That means at the bottom of the curve we\\'d have a small numerator over a large denominator, so the elasticity measure would be much lower, or inelastic.\n\nAs we move along the demand curve, the values for quantity and price go up or down, depending on which way we are moving, so the percentages for, say, a $1 difference in price or a one unit difference in quantity, will change as well, which means the ratios of those percentages will change.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nPrice elasticity measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded or supplied of a good to a change in its price. It is computed as the percentage change in quantity demanded (or supplied) divided by the percentage change in price. Elasticity can be described as elastic (or very responsive), unit elastic, or inelastic (not very responsive). Elastic demand or supply curves indicate that quantity demanded or supplied respond to price changes in a greater than proportional manner. An inelastic demand or supply curve is one where a given percentage change in price will cause a smaller percentage change in quantity demanded or supplied. A unitary elasticity means that a given percentage change in price leads to an equal percentage change in quantity demanded or supplied.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nFrom the data shown in [[link]](#Table_05_02) about demand for smart phones, calculate the price elasticity of demand from: point B to point C, point D to point E, and point G to point H.

A third case is that of constant unitary elasticity. We will describe each case. **Infinite elasticity**{: data-type=\"term\"} or **perfect elasticity**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded (Qd) or supplied (Qs) changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all. In both cases, the supply and the **demand curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} are horizontal as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_006). While perfectly elastic supply curves are unrealistic, goods with readily available inputs and whose production can be easily expanded will feature highly elastic supply curves. Examples include pizza, bread, books and pencils. Similarly, perfectly elastic demand is an extreme example. But luxury goods, goods that take a large share of individuals\u2019 income, and goods with many substitutes are likely to have highly elastic demand curves. Examples of such goods are Caribbean cruises and sports vehicles.\n\n elastic demand curve and supply curve. The quantity supplied or demanded is extremely responsive to price changes, moving from zero for prices close to P to infinite when price reach P.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C05_006 data-title=\"Infinite Elasticity \"}\n\n**Zero elasticity**{: data-type=\"term\"} or **perfect inelasticity**{: data-type=\"term\"}, as depicted in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_008) refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in quantity. While a perfectly inelastic supply is an extreme example, goods with limited supply of inputs are likely to feature highly inelastic supply curves. Examples include diamond rings or housing in prime locations such as apartments facing Central Park in New York City. Similarly, while perfectly inelastic demand is an extreme case, necessities with no close substitutes are likely to have highly inelastic demand curves. This is the case of life-saving drugs and gasoline.\n\n demanded or (b) supplied, regardless of the price.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C05_008 data-title=\"Zero Elasticity \"}\n\n**Constant unitary elasticity**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, in either a supply or demand curve, occurs when a price change of one percent results in a quantity change of one percent. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_016) shows a demand curve with constant unit elasticity. As we move down the demand curve from A to B, the price falls by 33% and quantity demanded rises by 33%; as you move from B to C, the price falls by 25% and the quantity demanded rises by 25%; as you move from C to D, the price falls by 16% and the quantity rises by 16%. Notice that in absolute value, the declines in price, as you step down the demand curve, are not identical. Instead, the price falls by $3 from A to B, by a smaller amount of $1.50 from B to C, and by a still smaller amount of $0.75 from C to D. As a result, a demand curve with constant unitary elasticity moves from a steeper slope on the left and a flatter slope on the right\u2014and a curved shape overall.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C05_016 data-title=\"A Constant Unitary Elasticity Demand Curve \"}\n\nUnlike the demand curve with unitary elasticity, the supply curve with unitary elasticity is represented by a straight line. In moving up the supply curve from left to right, each increase in quantity of 30, from 90 to 120 to 150 to 180, is equal in absolute value. However, in percentage value, the steps are decreasing, from 33.3% to 25% to 16.7%, because the original quantity points in each percentage calculation are getting larger and larger, which expands the denominator in the elasticity calculation.\n\nConsider the price changes moving up the supply curve in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_017). From points D to E to F and to G on the supply curve, each step of $1.50 is the same in absolute value. However, if the price changes are measured in percentage change terms, they are also decreasing, from 33.3% to 25% to 16.7%, because the original price points in each percentage calculation are getting larger and larger in value. Along the constant unitary elasticity supply curve, the percentage quantity increases on the horizontal axis exactly match the percentage price increases on the vertical axis\u2014so this supply curve has a constant unitary elasticity at all points.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C05_017 data-title=\"A Constant Unitary Elasticity Supply Curve \"}\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nInfinite or perfect elasticity refers to the extreme case where either the quantity demanded or supplied changes by an infinite amount in response to any change in price at all. Zero elasticity refers to the extreme case in which a percentage change in price, no matter how large, results in zero change in quantity. Constant unitary elasticity in either a supply or demand curve refers to a situation where a price change of one percent results in a quantity change of one percent.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhy is the demand curve with constant unitary elasticity concave?\n\n\n\nThe demand curve with constant unitary elasticity is concave because at high prices, a one percent decrease in price results in more than a one percent increase in quantity. As we move down the demand curve, price drops and the one percent decrease in price causes less than a one percent increase in quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the supply curve with constant unitary elasticity a straight line?\n\n\n\nThe constant unitary elasticity is a straight line because the curve slopes upward and both price and quantity are increasing proportionally.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nDescribe the general appearance of a demand or a supply curve with zero elasticity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the general appearance of a demand or a supply curve with infinite elasticity.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question\n\n\n\nCan you think of an industry (or product) with near infinite elasticity of supply in the short term?

To keep this example simple, assume that the band keeps all the money from ticket sales. Assume further that the band pays the costs for its appearance, but that these costs, like travel, setting up the stage, and so on, are the same regardless of how many people are in the audience. Finally, assume that all the tickets have the same price. (The same insights apply if ticket prices are more expensive for some seats than for others, but the calculations become more complicated.) The band knows that it faces a downward-sloping demand curve; that is, if the band raises the price of tickets, it will sell fewer tickets. How should the band set the price for tickets to bring in the most total revenue, which in this example, because costs are fixed, will also mean the highest profits for the band? Should the band sell more tickets at a lower price or fewer tickets at a higher price?\n\nThe key concept in thinking about collecting the most revenue is the price elasticity of demand. Total revenue is price times the quantity of tickets sold. Imagine that the band starts off thinking about a certain price, which will result in the sale of a certain quantity of tickets. The three possibilities are laid out in [\\[link\\]](#Table_05_05). If demand is elastic at that price level, then the band should cut the price, because the percentage drop in price will result in an even larger percentage increase in the quantity sold\u2014thus raising total revenue. However, if demand is inelastic at that original quantity level, then the band should raise the price of tickets, because a certain percentage increase in price will result in a smaller percentage decrease in the quantity sold\u2014and total revenue will rise. If demand has a unitary elasticity at that quantity, then a moderate percentage change in the price will be offset by an equal percentage change in quantity\u2014so the band will earn the same revenue whether it (moderately) increases or decreases the price of tickets.\n\n<table id=\"Table_05_05\" summary=\"If demand is Elastic then the percentage change in Qd is greater than the percentage in P. Therefore, a given percentage rise in P will be more than offset by a larger percentage fall in Q, so that total revenue (P &#xD7; Q) falls. If demand is Unitary then the percentage change in Qd is equal to the percentage change in P. Therefore, a given percentage rise in P will be exactly offset by an equal percentage fall in Q, so that total revenue (P &#xD7; Q) is unchanged. If demand is Inelastic then the percentage change in Qd is less than the percentage change in P. Therefore, a given percentage rise in P will cause a smaller percentage fall in Q, so that total revenue (P &#xD7; Q) rises.\"><caption>Will the Band Earn More Revenue by Changing Ticket Prices?</caption><thead>\n<tr>\n\t<th>If Demand Is . . .</th>\n\t<th>Then . . .</th>\n\t<th>Therefore . . .</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Elastic</td>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>%\u00a0</mo><mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0Qd</mtext><mo>&gt;</mo><mo>%\u00a0</mo><mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0P</mtext></math></td>\n          <td>A given % rise in P will be more than offset by a larger % fall in Q so that total revenue (P \u00d7 Q) falls.</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>Unitary</td>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>%\u00a0</mo><mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0Qd</mtext><mo>=</mo><mo>%\u00a0</mo><mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0P</mtext></math></td>\n          <td>A given % rise in P will be exactly offset by an equal % fall in Q so that total revenue (P \u00d7 Q) is unchanged.</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>Inelastic</td>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mo>%\u00a0</mo><mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0Qd</mtext><mo>&lt;</mo><mo>%\u00a0</mo><mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0P</mtext></math></td>\n          <td>A given % rise in P will cause a smaller % fall in Q so that total revenue (P \u00d7 Q) rises.</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody></table>\n\nWhat if the band keeps cutting price, because demand is elastic, until it reaches a level where all 15,000 seats in the available arena are sold? If demand remains elastic at that quantity, the band might try to move to a bigger arena, so that it could cut ticket prices further and see a larger percentage increase in the quantity of tickets sold. Of course, if the 15,000-seat arena is all that is available or if a larger arena would add substantially to costs, then this option may not work.\n\nConversely, a few bands are so famous, or have such fanatical followings, that demand for tickets may be inelastic right up to the point where the arena is full. These bands can, if they wish, keep raising the price of tickets. Ironically, some of the most popular bands could make more revenue by setting prices so high that the arena is not filled\u2014but those who buy the tickets would have to pay very high prices. However, bands sometimes choose to sell tickets for less than the absolute maximum they might be able to charge, often in the hope that fans will feel happier and spend more on recordings, T-shirts, and other paraphernalia.\n\n### Can Costs Be Passed on to Consumers?\n\nMost businesses face a day-to-day struggle to figure out ways to produce at a lower cost, as one pathway to their goal of earning higher profits. However, in some cases, the price of a key input over which the firm has no control may rise. For example, many chemical companies use petroleum as a **key input**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, but they have no control over the world market price for crude oil. Coffee shops use coffee as a key input, but they have no control over the world market price of coffee. If the cost of a key input rises, can the firm pass those higher costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices? Conversely, if new and less expensive ways of producing are invented, can the firm keep the benefits in the form of higher profits, or will the market pressure them to pass the gains along to consumers in the form of lower prices? The price elasticity of demand plays a key role in answering these questions.\n\nImagine that as a consumer of legal pharmaceutical products, you read a newspaper story that a technological breakthrough in the production of aspirin has occurred, so that every aspirin factory can now make aspirin more cheaply than it did before. What does this discovery mean to you? [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_019) illustrates two possibilities. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_019) (a), the demand curve is drawn as highly inelastic. In this case, a technological breakthrough that shifts supply to the right, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>, so that the equilibrium shifts from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>, creates a substantially lower price for the product with relatively little impact on the quantity sold. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_019) (b), the demand curve is drawn as highly elastic. In this case, the technological breakthrough leads to a much greater quantity being sold in the market at very close to the original price. Consumers benefit more, in general, when the demand curve is more inelastic because the shift in the supply results in a much lower price for consumers.\n\n, the result of this cost-saving technological improvement will be substantially lower prices. If demand is elastic, as in (b), the result will be only slightly lower prices. Consumers benefit in either case, from a greater quantity at a lower price, but the benefit is greater when demand is inelastic, as in (a).\"){: #CNX_Econ_C05_019 data-title=\"Passing along Cost Savings to Consumers \"}\n\nProducers of aspirin may find themselves in a nasty bind here. The situation shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_019), with extremely inelastic demand, means that a new invention may cause the price to drop dramatically while quantity changes little. As a result, the new production technology can lead to a drop in the revenue that firms earn from sales of aspirin. However, if strong competition exists between producers of aspirin, each producer may have little choice but to search for and implement any breakthrough that allows it to reduce production costs. After all, if one firm decides not to implement such a cost-saving technology, it can be driven out of business by other firms that do.\n\nSince demand for food is generally inelastic, farmers may often face the situation in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_019) (a). That is, a surge in production leads to a severe drop in price that can actually decrease the total revenue received by farmers. Conversely, poor weather or other conditions that cause a terrible year for farm production can sharply raise prices so that the total revenue received increases. The Clear It Up box discusses how these issues relate to coffee.\n\n\n\nHow do coffee prices fluctuate?\n\nCoffee is an international crop. The top five coffee-exporting nations are Brazil, Vietnam, Colombia, Indonesia, and Ethiopia. In these nations and others, 20 million families depend on selling coffee beans as their main source of income. These families are exposed to enormous risk, because the world price of coffee bounces up and down. For example, in 1993, the world price of coffee was about 50 cents per pound; in 1995 it was four times as high, at $2 per pound. By 1997 it had fallen by half to $1.00 per pound. In 1998 it leaped back up to $2 per pound. By 2001 it had fallen back to 46 cents a pound; by early 2011 it went back up to about $2.31 per pound. By the end of 2012, the price had fallen back to about $1.31 per pound.\n\nThe reason for these price bounces lies in a combination of inelastic demand and shifts in supply. The elasticity of coffee demand is only about 0.3; that is, a 10% rise in the price of coffee leads to a decline of about 3% in the quantity of coffee consumed. When a major frost hit the Brazilian coffee crop in 1994, coffee supply shifted to the left with an inelastic demand curve, leading to much higher prices. Conversely, when Vietnam entered the world coffee market as a major producer in the late 1990s, the supply curve shifted out to the right. With a highly inelastic demand curve, coffee prices fell dramatically. This situation is shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_019) (a).\n\n\n\nElasticity also reveals whether firms can pass higher costs that they incur on to consumers. Addictive substances tend to fall into this category. For example, the demand for cigarettes is relatively inelastic among regular smokers who are somewhat addicted; economic research suggests that increasing the price of cigarettes by 10% leads to about a 3% reduction in the quantity of cigarettes smoked by adults, so the elasticity of demand for cigarettes is 0.3. If society increases taxes on companies that make cigarettes, the result will be, as in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_020) (a), that the supply curve shifts from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>. However, as the equilibrium moves from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>, these taxes are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. These higher taxes on cigarettes will raise tax revenue for the government, but they will not much affect the quantity of smoking.\n\nIf the goal is to reduce the quantity of cigarettes demanded, it must be achieved by shifting this inelastic demand back to the left, perhaps with public programs to discourage the use of cigarettes or to help people to quit. For example, anti-smoking advertising campaigns have shown some ability to reduce smoking. However, if demand for cigarettes was more elastic, as in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_020) (b), then an increase in taxes that shifts supply from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub> and equilibrium from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> would reduce the quantity of cigarettes smoked substantially. Youth smoking seems to be more elastic than adult smoking\u2014that is, the quantity of youth smoking will fall by a greater percentage than the quantity of adult smoking in response to a given percentage increase in price.\n\n and (b). However, in (a), where demand is inelastic, the cost increase can largely be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices, without much of a decline in equilibrium quantity. In (b), demand is elastic, so the shift in supply results primarily in a lower equilibrium quantity. Consumers suffer in either case, but in (a), they suffer from paying a higher price for the same quantity, while in (b), they suffer from buying a lower quantity (and presumably needing to shift their consumption elsewhere).\"){: #CNX_Econ_C05_020 data-title=\"Passing along Higher Costs to Consumers \"}\n\n### Elasticity and Tax Incidence   {#eip-523}\n\nThe example of cigarette taxes showed that because demand is inelastic, taxes are not effective at reducing the equilibrium quantity of smoking, and they are mainly passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. The analysis, or manner, of how the burden of a tax is divided between consumers and producers is called **tax incidence**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Typically, the incidence, or burden, of a tax falls both on the consumers and producers of the taxed good. But if one wants to predict which group will bear most of the burden, all one needs to do is examine the elasticity of demand and supply. In the tobacco example, the tax burden falls on the most inelastic side of the market.\n\nIf demand is more inelastic than supply, consumers bear most of the tax burden, and if supply is more inelastic than demand, sellers bear most of the tax burden.\n\nThe intuition for this is simple. When the demand is inelastic, consumers are not very responsive to price changes, and the quantity demanded remains relatively constant when the tax is introduced. In the case of smoking, the demand is inelastic because consumers are addicted to the product. The government can then pass the tax burden along to consumers in the form of higher prices, without much of a decline in the equilibrium quantity.\n\nSimilarly, when a tax is introduced in a market with an inelastic supply, such as, for example, beachfront hotels, and sellers have no alternative than to accept lower prices for their business, taxes do not greatly affect the equilibrium quantity. The tax burden is now passed on to the sellers. If the supply was elastic and sellers had the possibility of reorganizing their businesses to avoid supplying the taxed good, the tax burden on the sellers would be much smaller. The tax would result in a much lower quantity sold instead of lower prices received. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_025) illustrates this relationship between the tax incidence and elasticity of demand and supply.\n\n and the price received by producers (Pp). (a) When the demand is more elastic than supply, the tax incidence on consumers Pc &#x2013; Pe is lower than the tax incidence on producers Pe &#x2013; Pp. (b) When the supply is more elastic than demand, the tax incidence on consumers Pc &#x2013; Pe is larger than the tax incidence on producers Pe &#x2013; Pp. The more elastic the demand and supply curves are, the lower the tax revenue. \"){: #CNX_Econ_C05_025 data-title=\" &#10;Elasticity and Tax Incidence\"}\n\nIn [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_025) (a), the supply is inelastic and the demand is elastic, such as in the example of beachfront hotels. While consumers may have other vacation choices, sellers can\u2019t easily move their businesses. By introducing a tax, the government essentially creates a wedge between the price paid by consumers Pc and the price received by producers Pp. In other words, of the total price paid by consumers, part is retained by the sellers and part is paid to the government in the form of a tax. The distance between Pc and Pp is the tax rate. The new market price is Pc, but sellers receive only Pp per unit sold, as they pay Pc-Pp to the government. Since a tax can be viewed as raising the costs of production, this could also be represented by a leftward shift of the supply curve, where the new supply curve would intercept the demand at the new quantity Qt. For simplicity, [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_025) omits the shift in the supply curve.\n\nThe tax revenue is given by the shaded area, which is obtained by multiplying the tax per unit by the total quantity sold Qt. The tax incidence on the consumers is given by the difference between the price paid Pc and the initial equilibrium price Pe. The tax incidence on the sellers is given by the difference between the initial equilibrium price Pe and the price they receive after the tax is introduced Pp. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_025) (a), the tax burden falls disproportionately on the sellers, and a larger proportion of the tax revenue (the shaded area) is due to the resulting lower price received by the sellers than by the resulting higher prices paid by the buyers. The example of the tobacco excise tax could be described by [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_025) (b) where the supply is more elastic than demand. The tax incidence now falls disproportionately on consumers, as shown by the large difference between the price they pay, Pc, and the initial equilibrium price, Pe. Sellers receive a lower price than before the tax, but this difference is much smaller than the change in consumers\u2019 price. From this analysis one can also predict whether a tax is likely to create a large revenue or not. The more elastic the demand curve, the easier it is for consumers to reduce quantity instead of paying higher prices. The more elastic the supply curve, the easier it is for sellers to reduce the quantity sold, instead of taking lower prices. In a market where both the demand and supply are very elastic, the imposition of an excise tax generates low revenue.\n\nExcise taxes tend to be thought to hurt mainly the specific industries they target. For example, the medical device excise tax, in effect since 2013, has been controversial for it can delay industry profitability and therefore hamper start-ups and medical innovation. But ultimately, whether the tax burden falls mostly on the medical device industry or on the patients depends simply on the elasticity of demand and supply.\n\n### Long-Run vs. Short-Run Impact\n\nElasticities are often lower in the short run than in the long run. On the demand side of the market, it can sometimes be difficult to change Qd in the short run, but easier in the long run. Consumption of energy is a clear example. In the short run, it is not easy for a person to make substantial changes in the energy consumption. Maybe you can carpool to work sometimes or adjust your home thermostat by a few degrees if the cost of energy rises, but that is about all. However, in the long-run you can purchase a car that gets more miles to the gallon, choose a job that is closer to where you live, buy more energy-efficient home appliances, or install more insulation in your home. As a result, the elasticity of demand for energy is somewhat inelastic in the short run, but much more elastic in the long run.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_021) is an example, based roughly on historical experience, for the responsiveness of Qd to price changes. In 1973, the price of crude oil was $12 per barrel and total consumption in the U.S. economy was 17 million barrels per day. That year, the nations who were members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cut off oil exports to the United States for six months because the Arab members of OPEC disagreed with the U.S. support for Israel. OPEC did not bring exports back to their earlier levels until 1975\u2014a policy that can be interpreted as a shift of the supply curve to the left in the U.S. petroleum market. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_021) (a) and [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_021) (b) show the same original equilibrium point and the same identical shift of a supply curve to the left from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>.\n\n between demand curve D and supply curve S0 is the same in both (a) and (b). The shift of supply to the left from S0 to S1 is identical in both (a) and (b). The new equilibrium (E1) has a higher price and a lower quantity than the original equilibrium (E0) in both (a) and (b). However, the shape of the demand curve D is different in (a) and (b). As a result, the shift in supply can result either in a new equilibrium with a much higher price and an only slightly smaller quantity, as in (a), or in a new equilibrium with only a small increase in price and a relatively larger reduction in quantity, as in (b).\"){: #CNX_Econ_C05_021 data-title=\"How a Shift in Supply Can Affect Price or Quantity \"}\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_021) (a) shows inelastic demand for oil in the short run similar to that which existed for the United States in 1973. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_021) (a), the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at a price of $25 per barrel, roughly double the price before the OPEC shock, and an equilibrium quantity of 16 million barrels per day. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C05_021) (b) shows what the outcome would have been if the U.S. demand for oil had been more elastic, a result more likely over the long term. This alternative equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) would have resulted in a smaller price increase to $14 per barrel and larger reduction in equilibrium quantity to 13 million barrels per day. In 1983, for example, U.S. petroleum consumption was 15.3 million barrels a day, which was lower than in 1973 or 1975. U.S. petroleum consumption was down even though the U.S. economy was about one-fourth larger in 1983 than it had been in 1973. The primary reason for the lower quantity was that higher energy prices spurred conservation efforts, and after a decade of home insulation, more fuel-efficient cars, more efficient appliances and machinery, and other fuel-conserving choices, the demand curve for energy had become more elastic.\n\nOn the supply side of markets, producers of goods and services typically find it easier to expand production in the long term of several years rather than in the short run of a few months. After all, in the short run it can be costly or difficult to build a new factory, hire many new workers, or open new stores. But over a few years, all of these are possible.\n\nIndeed, in most markets for goods and services, prices bounce up and down more than quantities in the short run, but quantities often move more than prices in the long run. The underlying reason for this pattern is that supply and demand are often inelastic in the short run, so that shifts in either demand or supply can cause a relatively greater change in prices. But since supply and demand are more elastic in the long run, the long-run movements in prices are more muted, while quantity adjusts more easily in the long run.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nIn the market for goods and services, quantity supplied and quantity demanded are often relatively slow to react to changes in price in the short run, but react more substantially in the long run. As a result, demand and supply often (but not always) tend to be relatively inelastic in the short run and relatively elastic in the long run. The tax incidence depends on the relative price elasticity of supply and demand. When supply is more elastic than demand, buyers bear most of the tax burden, and when demand is more elastic than supply, producers bear most of the cost of the tax. Tax revenue is larger the more inelastic the demand and supply are.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nThe federal government decides to require that automobile manufacturers install new anti-pollution equipment that costs $2,000 per car. Under what conditions can carmakers pass almost all of this cost along to car buyers? Under what conditions can carmakers pass very little of this cost along to car buyers?\n\n\n\nCarmakers can pass this cost along to consumers if the demand for these cars is inelastic. If the demand for these cars is elastic, then the manufacturer must pay for the equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you are in charge of sales at a pharmaceutical company, and your firm has a new drug that causes bald men to grow hair. Assume that the company wants to earn as much revenue as possible from this drug. If the elasticity of demand for your company\u2019s product at the current price is 1.4, would you advise the company to raise the price, lower the price, or to keep the price the same? What if the elasticity were 0.6? What if it were 1? Explain your answer.\n\n\n\nIf the elasticity is 1.4 at current prices, you would advise the company to lower its price on the product, since a decrease in price will be offset by the increase in the amount of the drug sold. If the elasticity were 0.6, then you would advise the company to increase its price. Increases in price will offset the decrease in number of units sold, but increase your total revenue. If elasticity is 1, the total revenue is already maximized, and you would advise that the company maintain its current price level.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nIf demand is elastic, will shifts in supply have a larger effect on equilibrium quantity or on price?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf demand is inelastic, will shifts in supply have a larger effect on equilibrium price or on quantity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf supply is elastic, will shifts in demand have a larger effect on equilibrium quantity or on price?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf supply is inelastic, will shifts in demand have a larger effect on equilibrium price or on quantity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you usually expect elasticity of demand or supply to be higher in the short run or in the long run?

For one year, the city charges a variety of different tolls and records information on how many drivers cross the bridge. The city thus gathers information about elasticity of demand. If the city wishes to raise as much revenue as possible from the tolls, where will the city decide to charge a toll: in the inelastic portion of the demand curve, the elastic portion of the demand curve, or the unit elastic portion? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a market where the supply curve is perfectly inelastic, how does an excise tax affect the price paid by consumers and the quantity bought and sold?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nAssume that the supply of low-skilled workers is fairly elastic, but the employers\u2019 demand for such workers is fairly inelastic. If the policy goal is to expand employment for low-skilled workers, is it better to focus on policy tools to shift the supply of unskilled labor or on tools to shift the demand for unskilled labor? What if the policy goal is to raise wages for this group?

{"module_id": "m48619", "module_title": "Economics - m48619", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48619", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Calculate the income elasticity of demand and the cross-price elasticity of demand\n* Calculate the elasticity in labor and financial capital markets through an understanding of the elasticity of labor supply and the elasticity of savings\n* Apply concepts of price elasticity to real-world situations\n\n\n\nThe basic idea of elasticity\u2014how a percentage change in one variable causes a percentage change in another variable\u2014does not just apply to the responsiveness of supply and demand to changes in the price of a product. Recall that quantity demanded (Qd) depends on income, tastes and preferences, the prices of related goods, and so on, as well as price. Similarly, quantity supplied (Qs) depends on the cost of production, and so on, as well as price. Elasticity can be measured for any determinant of supply and demand, not just the price.\n\n### Income Elasticity of Demand\n\nThe **income elasticity of demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Income\u00a0elasticity\u00a0of\u00a0demand</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mtext>% change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity\u00a0demanded</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>% change\u00a0in\u00a0income</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nFor most products, most of the time, the income elasticity of demand is positive: that is, a rise in income will cause an increase in the quantity demanded. This pattern is common enough that these goods are referred to as **normal goods**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. However, for a few goods, an increase in income means that one might purchase less of the good; for example, those with a higher income might buy fewer hamburgers, because they are buying more steak instead, or those with a higher income might buy less cheap wine and more imported beer. When the income elasticity of demand is negative, the good is called an **inferior good**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\nThe concepts of normal and inferior goods were introduced in [Demand and Supply](/m48628). A higher level of income for a normal good causes a demand curve to shift to the right for a normal good, which means that the income elasticity of demand is positive. How far the demand shifts depends on the income elasticity of demand. A higher income elasticity means a larger shift. However, for an inferior good, that is, when the income elasticity of demand is negative, a higher level of income would cause the demand curve for that good to shift to the left. Again, how much it shifts depends on how large the (negative) income elasticity is.\n\n### Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand\n\nA change in the price of one good can shift the quantity demanded for another good. If the two goods are complements, like bread and peanut butter, then a drop in the price of one good will lead to an increase in the quantity demanded of the other good. However, if the two goods are substitutes, like plane tickets and train tickets, then a drop in the price of one good will cause people to substitute toward that good, and to reduce consumption of the other good. Cheaper plane tickets lead to fewer train tickets, and vice versa.\n\nThe **cross-price elasticity of demand**{: data-type=\"term\"} puts some meat on the bones of these ideas. The term \u201ccross-price\u201d refers to the idea that the price of one good is affecting the quantity demanded of a different good. Specifically, the cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity of good A that is demanded as a result of a percentage change in the price of good B.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Cross-price\u00a0elasticity\u00a0of\u00a0demand</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0Qd\u00a0of\u00a0good\u00a0A</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0price\u00a0of\u00a0good\u00a0B</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nSubstitute goods have positive cross-price elasticities of demand: if good A is a substitute for good B, like coffee and tea, then a higher price for B will mean a greater quantity consumed of A. Complement goods have negative cross-price elasticities: if good A is a complement for good B, like coffee and sugar, then a higher price for B will mean a lower quantity consumed of A.\n\n### Elasticity in Labor and Financial Capital Markets\n\nThe concept of elasticity applies to any market, not just markets for goods and services. In the labor market, for example, the **wage elasticity of labor supply**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014that is, the percentage change in hours worked divided by the percentage change in wages\u2014will determine the shape of the labor supply curve. Specifically:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Elasticity\u00a0of\u00a0labor\u00a0supply</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mtext>% change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity\u00a0of\u00a0labor\u00a0supplied</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>% change\u00a0in\u00a0wage</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nThe wage elasticity of labor supply for teenage workers is generally thought to be fairly elastic: that is, a certain percentage change in wages will lead to a larger percentage change in the quantity of hours worked. Conversely, the wage elasticity of labor supply for adult workers in their thirties and forties is thought to be fairly inelastic. When wages move up or down by a certain percentage amount, the quantity of hours that adults in their prime earning years are willing to supply changes but by a lesser percentage amount.\n\nIn markets for financial capital, the **elasticity of savings**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014that is, the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates\u2014will describe the shape of the supply curve for financial capital. That is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Elasticity\u00a0of\u00a0savings</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mtext>% change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity\u00a0of\u00a0financial\u00a0savings</mtext></mrow><mrow><mtext>% change\u00a0in\u00a0interest\u00a0rate</mtext></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nSometimes laws are proposed that seek to increase the quantity of savings by offering tax breaks so that the return on savings is higher. Such a policy will increase the quantity if the supply curve for financial capital is elastic, because then a given percentage increase in the return to savings will cause a higher percentage increase in the quantity of savings. However, if the supply curve for financial capital is highly inelastic, then a percentage increase in the return to savings will cause only a small increase in the quantity of savings. The evidence on the supply curve of financial capital is controversial but, at least in the short run, the elasticity of savings with respect to the interest rate appears fairly inelastic.\n\n### Expanding the Concept of Elasticity\n\nThe elasticity concept does not even need to relate to a typical supply or demand curve at all. For example, imagine that you are studying whether the Internal Revenue Service should spend more money on auditing tax returns. The question can be framed in terms of the elasticity of tax collections with respect to spending on tax enforcement; that is, what is the percentage change in tax collections derived from a percentage change in spending on tax enforcement?\n\nWith all of the elasticity concepts that have just been described, some of which are listed in [\\[link\\]](#Table_05_08), the possibility of confusion arises. When you hear the phrases \u201celasticity of demand\u201d or \u201celasticity of supply,\u201d they refer to the elasticity with respect to price. Sometimes, either to be extremely clear or because a wide variety of elasticities are being discussed, the elasticity of demand or the demand elasticity will be called the price elasticity of demand or the \u201celasticity of demand with respect to price.\u201d Similarly, elasticity of supply or the supply elasticity is sometimes called, to avoid any possibility of confusion, the price elasticity of supply or \u201cthe elasticity of supply with respect to price.\u201d But in whatever context elasticity is invoked, the idea always refers to percentage change in one variable, almost always a price or money variable, and how it causes a percentage change in another variable, typically a quantity variable of some kind.\n\n<table id=\"Table_05_08\" summary=\"Income elasticity of demand = percentage change in Qd divided by percentage change in income. Cross-price = percentage change in Qd of good A divided by percentage change in price of good B. Wage elasticity of labor supply = percentage change in quantity of labor supplied divided by percentage change in wage. Wage elasticity of labor demand = percentage change in quantity of labor demanded divided by percentage change in wage. Interest rate elasticity of savings = percentage change in quantity of savings divided by percentage change in interest rate. Interest rate elasticity of borrowing = percentage change in quantity of borrowing divided by percentage change in interest rate.\"><caption>Formulas for Calculating Elasticity</caption><tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Income\u00a0elasticity\u00a0of\u00a0demand</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0Qd</mtext><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0income</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n         <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Cross-price elasticity of demand</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>% change in Qd of good A</mtext><mtext>% change in price of good B</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></td>\n                  </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Wage elasticity of labor supply</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>% change in quantity of labor supplied</mtext><mtext>% change in wage</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></td>\n        </tr>\n\n<tr>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Wage elasticity of labor demand</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>% change in quantity of labor demanded</mtext><mtext>% change in wage</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></td>\n        </tr>\n\n<tr>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Interest rate elasticity of savings</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>% change in quantity of savings</mtext><mtext>% change in interest rate</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></td>\n        </tr>\n\n<tr>\n          <td><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Interest rate elasticity of borrowing</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>% change in quantity of borrowing</mtext><mtext>% change in interest rate</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math></td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody></table>\n\n\n\nThat Will Be How Much?\n\nHow did the 60% price increase in 2011 end up for Netflix? It has been a very bumpy ride.\n\nBefore the price increase, there were about 24.6 million U.S. subscribers. After the price increase, 810,000 infuriated U.S. consumers canceled their Netflix subscriptions, dropping the total number of subscribers to 23.79 million. Fast forward to June 2013, when there were 36 million streaming Netflix subscribers in the United States. This was an increase of 11.4 million subscribers since the price increase\u2014an average per quarter growth of about 1.6 million. This growth is less than the 2 million per quarter increases Netflix experienced in the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011.\n\nDuring the first year after the price increase, the firm\u2019s stock price (a measure of future expectations for the firm) fell from about $300 per share to just under $54. In 2015, however, the stock price is at $448 per share. Today, Netflix has 57 million subscribers in fifty countries.\n\nWhat happened? Obviously, Netflix company officials understood the law of demand. Company officials reported, when announcing the price increase, this could result in the loss of about 600,000 existing subscribers. Using the elasticity of demand formula, it is easy to see company officials expected an inelastic response:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>\u2013600,000/[(24\u00a0million\u00a0+\u00a024.6\u00a0million)/2]</mtext><mtext>$6/[($10\u00a0+\u00a0$16)/2]</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>\u2013600,000/24.3\u00a0million</mtext><mtext>$6/$13</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>\u20130.025</mtext><mtext>0.46</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u20130.05</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nIn addition, Netflix officials had anticipated the price increase would have little impact on attracting new customers. Netflix anticipated adding up to 1.29 million new subscribers in the third quarter of 2011. It is true this was slower growth than the firm had experienced\u2014about 2 million per quarter.\n\nWhy was the estimate of customers leaving so far off? In the 18 years since Netflix had been founded, there was an increase in the number of close, but not perfect, substitutes. Consumers now had choices ranging from Vudu, Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Redbox, to retail stores. Jaime Weinman reported in *Maclean\u2019s* that Redbox kiosks are \u201ca five-minute drive for less from 68 percent of Americans, and it seems that many people still find a five-minute drive more convenient than loading up a movie online.\u201d It seems that in 2012, many consumers still preferred a physical DVD disk over streaming video.\n\nWhat missteps did the Netflix management make? In addition to misjudging the elasticity of demand, by failing to account for close substitutes, it seems they may have also misjudged customers\u2019 preferences and tastes. Yet, as the population increases, the preference for streaming video may overtake physical DVD disks. Netflix, the source of numerous late night talk show laughs and jabs in 2011, may yet have the last laugh.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nElasticity is a general term, referring to percentage change of one variable divided by percentage change of a related variable that can be applied to many economic connections. For instance, the income elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in income. The cross-price elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded of a good divided by the percentage change in the price of another good. Elasticity applies in labor markets and financial capital markets just as it does in markets for goods and services. The wage elasticity of labor supply is the percentage change in the quantity of hours supplied divided by the percentage change in the wage. The elasticity of savings with respect to interest rates is the percentage change in the quantity of savings divided by the percentage change in interest rates.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhat would the gasoline price elasticity of supply mean to UPS or FedEx?\n\n\n\nThe percentage change in quantity supplied as a result of a given percentage change in the price of gasoline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average annual income rises from $25,000 to $38,000, and the quantity of bread consumed in a year by the average person falls from 30 loaves to 22 loaves.

In too many countries, workers found themselves out of a job. In developed countries, unemployment compensation provided a safety net, but families still saw a marked decrease in disposable income and had to make tough spending decisions. Of course, non-essential, discretionary spending was the first to go.\n\nEven so, there was one particular category that saw a universal increase in spending world-wide during that time\u2014an 18% uptick in the United States, specifically. You might guess that consumers began eating more meals at home, increasing spending at the grocery store. But the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 Consumer Expenditure Survey, which tracks U.S. food spending over time, showed \u201creal total food spending by U.S. households declined five percent between 2006 and 2009.\u201d So, it was not groceries. Just what product would people around the world demand more of during tough economic times, and more importantly, why? (Find out at chapter\u2019s end.)\n\nThat question leads us to this chapter\u2019s topic\u2014analyzing how consumers make choices. For most consumers, using \u201ceeny, meeny, miney, moe\u201d is not how they make decisions; their decision-making processes have been educated far beyond a children\u2019s rhyme.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Consumer Choices\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Consumption Choices\n* How Changes in Income and Prices Affect Consumption Choices\n* Labor-Leisure Choices\n* Intertemporal Choices in Financial Capital Markets\n\n\n\nMicroeconomics seeks to understand the behavior of individual economic agents such as individuals and businesses. Economists believe that individuals\u2019 decisions, such as what goods and services to buy, can be analyzed as choices made within certain budget constraints. Generally, consumers are trying to get the most for their limited budget. In economic terms they are trying to maximize total utility, or satisfaction, given their budget constraint.\n\nEveryone has their own personal tastes and preferences. The French say: *Chacun \u00e0 son go\u00fbt*, or \u201cEach to his own taste.\u201d An old Latin saying states, *De gustibus non est disputandum* or \u201cThere\u2019s no disputing about taste.\u201d If people\u2019s decisions are based on their own tastes and personal preferences, however, then how can economists hope to analyze the choices consumers make?\n\nAn economic explanation for why people make different choices begins with accepting the proverbial wisdom that tastes are a matter of personal preference. But economists also believe that the choices people make are influenced by their incomes, by the prices of goods and services they consume, and by factors like where they live. This chapter introduces the economic theory of how consumers make choices about what to buy, how much to work, and how much to save.\n\nThe analysis in this chapter will build on the three budget constraints introduced in the [Choice in a World of Scarcity](/m48602){: .target-chapter} chapter. These were the consumption choice budget constraint, the labor-leisure budget constraint, and the intertemporal budget constraint. This chapter will also illustrate how economic theory provides a tool to systematically look at the full range of possible consumption choices to predict how consumption responds to changes in prices or incomes. After reading this chapter, consult the appendix [Indifference Curves](/m48833) to learn more about representing utility and choice through indifference curves.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

[\\[link\\]](#Table_06_01) shows spending patterns for the average U.S. household. The first row shows income and, after taxes and personal savings are subtracted, it shows that, in 2015, the average U.S. household spent $48,109 on consumption. The table then breaks down consumption into various categories. The average U.S. household spent roughly one-third of its consumption on shelter and other housing expenses, another one-third on food and vehicle expenses, and the rest on a variety of items, as shown. Of course, these patterns will vary for specific households by differing levels of family income, by geography, and by preferences.\n\n<table id=\"Table_06_01\" summary=\"This table has two columns and twelve rows.

In a budget constraint line, the quantity of one good is measured on the horizontal axis and the quantity of the other good is measured on the vertical axis. The budget constraint line shows the various combinations of two goods that are affordable given consumer income. Consider the situation of Jos\u00e9, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_001). Jos\u00e9 likes to collect T-shirts and watch movies.\n\nIn [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_001), the quantity of T-shirts is shown on the horizontal axis, while the quantity of movies is shown on the vertical axis. If Jos\u00e9 had unlimited income or goods were free, then he could consume without limit. But Jos\u00e9, like all of us, faces a **budget constraint**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Jos\u00e9 has a total of $56 to spend. The price of T-shirts is $14 and the price of movies is $7. Notice that the vertical intercept of the budget constraint line is at eight movies and zero T-shirts ($56/$7=8). The horizontal intercept of the budget constraint is four, where Jos\u00e9 spends of all of his money on T-shirts and no movies ($56/14=4). The slope of the budget constraint line is rise/run or \u20138/4=\u20132. The specific choices along the budget constraint line show the combinations of T-shirts and movies that are affordable.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C06_001 data-title=\"A Choice between Consumption Goods \"}\n\nJos\u00e9 wishes to choose the combination that will provide him with the greatest **utility**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which is the term economists use to describe a person\u2019s level of satisfaction or happiness with his or her choices.\n\nLet\u2019s begin with an assumption, which will be discussed in more detail later, that Jos\u00e9 can measure his own utility with something called *utils*. (It is important to note that you cannot make comparisons between the utils of individuals; if one person gets 20 utils from a cup of coffee and another gets 10 utils, this does not mean than the first person gets more enjoyment from the coffee than the other or that they enjoy the coffee twice as much.) [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_02) shows how Jos\u00e9\u2019s utility is connected with his consumption of T-shirts or movies. The first column of the table shows the quantity of T-shirts consumed. The second column shows the total utility, or total amount of satisfaction, that Jos\u00e9 receives from consuming that number of T-shirts. The most common pattern of total utility, as shown here, is that consuming additional goods leads to greater total utility, but at a decreasing rate. The third column shows **marginal utility**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption. This equation for marginal utility is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>MU</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0total\u00a0utility</mtext><mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nNotice that marginal utility diminishes as additional units are consumed, which means that each subsequent unit of a good consumed provides less *additional* utility. For example, the first T-shirt Jos\u00e9 picks is his favorite and it gives him an addition of 22 utils. The fourth T-shirt is just to something to wear when all his other clothes are in the wash and yields only 18 additional utils. This is an example of the law of **diminishing marginal utility**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which holds that the additional utility decreases with each unit added.\n\nThe rest of [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_02) shows the quantity of movies that Jos\u00e9 attends, and his total and marginal utility from seeing each movie. Total utility follows the expected pattern: it increases as the number of movies seen rises. Marginal utility also follows the expected pattern: each additional movie brings a smaller gain in utility than the previous one. The first movie Jos\u00e9 attends is the one he wanted to see the most, and thus provides him with the highest level of utility or satisfaction. The fifth movie he attends is just to kill time. Notice that total utility is also the sum of the marginal utilities. Read the next Work It Out feature for instructions on how to calculate total utility.\n\n<table id=\"Table_06_02\" summary=\"The table has columns quantity, total utility, and marginal utility for t-shirts and movies.

Observe that, at point Q (for example), Jos\u00e9 consumes three T-shirts and two movies.\n\nStep 2. Look at [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_02). You can see from the fourth row/second column that three T-shirts are worth 63 utils. Similarly, the second row/fifth column shows that two movies are worth 31 utils.\n\nStep 3. From this information, you can calculate that point Q has a total utility of 94 (63 + 31).\n\nStep 4. You can repeat the same calculations for each point on [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_03), in which the total utility numbers are shown in the last column.\n\n\n\nFor Jos\u00e9, the highest total utility for all possible combinations of goods occurs at point S, with a total utility of 103 from consuming one T-shirt and six movies.\n\n### Choosing with Marginal Utility\n\nMost people approach their utility-maximizing combination of choices in a step-by-step way. This step-by-step approach is based on looking at the tradeoffs, measured in terms of marginal utility, of consuming less of one good and more of another.\n\nFor example, say that Jos\u00e9 starts off thinking about spending all his money on T-shirts and choosing point P, which corresponds to four T-shirts and no movies, as illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_001). Jos\u00e9 chooses this starting point randomly; he has to start somewhere. Then he considers giving up the last T-shirt, the one that provides him the least marginal utility, and using the money he saves to buy two movies instead. [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_04) tracks the step-by-step series of decisions Jos\u00e9 needs to make (*Key*\\: T-shirts are $14, movies are $7, and income is $56). The following Work It Out feature explains how marginal utility can effect decision making.\n\n<table id=\"Table_06_04\" summary=\"The table has for columns.

From [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_02), Jos\u00e9 can see that the marginal utility of the fourth T-shirt is 18. If Jos\u00e9 gives up the fourth T-shirt, then he loses 18 utils.\n\nStep 2. Giving up the fourth T-shirt, however, frees up $14 (the price of a T-shirt), allowing Jos\u00e9 to buy the first two movies (at $7 each).\n\nStep 3. Jos\u00e9 knows that the marginal utility of the first movie is 16 and the marginal utility of the second movie is 15. Thus, if Jos\u00e9 moves from point P to point Q, he gives up 18 utils (from the T-shirt), but gains 31 utils (from the movies).\n\nStep 4. Gaining 31 utils and losing 18 utils is a net gain of 13. This is just another way of saying that the total utility at Q (94 according to the last column in [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_03)) is 13 more than the total utility at P (81).\n\nStep 5. So, for Jos\u00e9, it makes sense to give up the fourth T-shirt in order to buy two movies.\n\n\n\nJos\u00e9 clearly prefers point Q to point P. Now repeat this step-by-step process of decision making with marginal utilities. Jos\u00e9 thinks about giving up the third T-shirt and surrendering a marginal utility of 20, in exchange for purchasing two more movies that promise a combined marginal utility of 27. Jos\u00e9 prefers point R to point Q. What if Jos\u00e9 thinks about going beyond R to point S? Giving up the second T-shirt means a marginal utility loss of 21, and the marginal utility gain from the fifth and sixth movies would combine to make a marginal utility gain of 23, so Jos\u00e9 prefers point S to R.\n\nHowever, if Jos\u00e9 seeks to go beyond point S to point T, he finds that the loss of marginal utility from giving up the first T-shirt is 22, while the marginal utility gain from the last two movies is only a total of 19. If Jos\u00e9 were to choose point T, his utility would fall to 100. Through these stages of thinking about marginal tradeoffs, Jos\u00e9 again concludes that S, with one T-shirt and six movies, is the choice that will provide him with the highest level of total utility. This step-by-step approach will reach the same conclusion regardless of Jos\u00e9\u2019s starting point.\n\nAnother way to look at this is by focusing on satisfaction per dollar. **Marginal utility per dollar**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the amount of additional utility Jos\u00e9 receives given the price of the product. For Jos\u00e9\u2019s T-shirts and movies, the marginal utility per dollar is shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_05).\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>marginal\u00a0utility\u00a0per dollar</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>marginal\u00a0utility</mtext><mtext>price</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nJos\u00e9\u2019s first purchase will be a movie. Why? Because it gives him the highest marginal utility per dollar and it is affordable. Jos\u00e9 will continue to purchase the good which gives him the highest marginal utility per dollar until he exhausts the budget. Jos\u00e9 will keep purchasing movies because they give him a greater \u201cbang or the buck\u201d until the sixth movie is equivalent to a T-shirt purchase. Jos\u00e9 can afford to purchase that T-shirt. So Jos\u00e9 will choose to purchase six movies and one T-shirt.\n\n<table id=\"Table_06_05\" summary=\"The table has 8 columns and 7 rows of data.

Since the price of T-shirts is twice as high as the price of movies, to maximize utility the last T-shirt chosen needs to provide exactly twice the marginal utility (MU) of the last movie. If the last T-shirt provides less than twice the marginal utility of the last movie, then the T-shirt is providing less \u201cbang for the buck\u201d (i.e., marginal utility per dollar spent) than if the same money were spent on movies. If this is so, Jos\u00e9 should trade the T-shirt for more movies to increase his total utility. Marginal utility per dollar measures the additional utility that Jos\u00e9 will enjoy given what he has to pay for the good.\n\nIf the last T-shirt provides more than twice the marginal utility of the last movie, then the T-shirt is providing more \u201cbang for the buck\u201d or marginal utility per dollar, than if the money were spent on movies. As a result, Jos\u00e9 should buy more T-shirts. Notice that at Jos\u00e9\u2019s optimal choice of point S, the marginal utility from the first T-shirt, of 22 is exactly twice the marginal utility of the sixth movie, which is 11. At this choice, the marginal utility per dollar is the same for both goods. This is a tell-tale signal that Jos\u00e9 has found the point with highest total utility.\n\nThis argument can be written as a general rule: the utility-maximizing choice between consumption goods occurs where the marginal utility per dollar is the same for both goods.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mfrac><msub><mtext>MU</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mtext>P</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><msub><mtext>MU</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><msub><mtext>P</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nA sensible economizer will pay twice as much for something only if, in the marginal comparison, the item confers twice as much utility. Notice that the formula for the table above is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mfrac><mn>22</mn><mtext>$14</mtext></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mn>11</mn><mtext>$7</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>1.6</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>1.6</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nThe following Work It Out feature provides step by step guidance for this concept of utility-maximizing choices.\n\n\n\nMaximizing Utility\n\nThe general rule, <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mfrac><msub><mtext>MU</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mtext>P</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><msub><mtext>MU</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><msub><mtext>P</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n, means that the last dollar spent on each good provides exactly the same marginal utility. So:\n\nStep 1. If we traded a dollar more of movies for a dollar more of T-shirts, the marginal utility gained from T-shirts would exactly offset the marginal utility lost from fewer movies. In other words, the net gain would be zero.\n\nStep 2. Products, however, usually cost more than a dollar, so we cannot trade a dollar\u2019s worth of movies. The best we can do is trade two movies for another T-shirt, since in this example T-shirts cost twice what a movie does.\n\nStep 3. If we trade two movies for one T-shirt, we would end up at point R (two T-shirts and four movies).\n\nStep 4. Choice 4 in [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_04) shows that if we move to point S, we would lose 21 utils from one less T-shirt, but gain 23 utils from two more movies, so we would end up with more total utility at point S.\n\nIn short, the general rule shows us the utility-maximizing choice.\n\n\n\nThere is another, equivalent way to think about this. The general rule can also be expressed as *the ratio of the prices of the two goods should be equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities.* When the price of good 1 is divided by the price of good 2, at the utility-maximizing point this will equal the marginal utility of good 1 divided by the marginal utility of good 2. This rule, known as the **consumer equilibrium**{: data-type=\"term\"}, can be written in algebraic form:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mfrac><msub><mtext>P</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mtext>P</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><msub><mtext>MU</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mtext>MU</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nAlong the budget constraint, the total price of the two goods remains the same, so the ratio of the prices does not change. However, the marginal utility of the two goods changes with the quantities consumed. At the optimal choice of one T-shirt and six movies, point S, the ratio of marginal utility to price for T-shirts (22:14) matches the ratio of marginal utility to price for movies (of 11:7).\n\n### Measuring Utility with Numbers\n\nThis discussion of utility started off with an assumption that it is possible to place numerical values on utility, an assumption that may seem questionable. You can buy a thermometer for measuring temperature at the hardware store, but what store sells an \u201cutilimometer\u201d for measuring utility? However, while measuring utility with numbers is a convenient assumption to clarify the explanation, the key assumption is not that utility can be measured by an outside party, but only that individuals can decide which of two alternatives they prefer.\n\nTo understand this point, think back to the step-by-step process of finding the choice with highest total utility by comparing the marginal utility that is gained and lost from different choices along the budget constraint. As Jos\u00e9 compares each choice along his budget constraint to the previous choice, what matters is not the specific numbers that he places on his utility\u2014or whether he uses any numbers at all\u2014but only that he personally can identify which choices he prefers.\n\nIn this way, the step-by-step process of choosing the highest level of utility resembles rather closely how many people make consumption decisions. We think about what will make us the happiest; we think about what things cost; we think about buying a little more of one item and giving up a little of something else; we choose what provides us with the greatest level of satisfaction. The vocabulary of comparing the points along a budget constraint and total and marginal utility is just a set of tools for discussing this everyday process in a clear and specific manner. It is welcome news that specific utility numbers are not central to the argument, since a good utilimometer is hard to find. Do not worry\u2014while we cannot measure utils, by the end of the next module, we will have transformed our analysis into something we can measure\u2014demand.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nEconomic analysis of household behavior is based on the assumption that people seek the highest level of utility or satisfaction. Individuals are the only judge of their own utility. In general, greater consumption of a good brings higher total utility. However, the additional utility received from each unit of greater consumption tends to decline in a pattern of diminishing marginal utility.\n\nThe utility-maximizing choice on a consumption budget constraint can be found in several ways. You can add up total utility of each choice on the budget line and choose the highest total. You can choose a starting point at random and compare the marginal utility gains and losses of moving to neighboring points\u2014and thus eventually seek out the preferred choice. Alternatively, you can compare the ratio of the marginal utility to price of good 1 with the marginal utility to price of good 2 and apply the rule that at the optimal choice, the two ratios should be equal:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mfrac><msub><mtext>MU</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub><msub><mtext>P</mtext><mn>1</mn></msub></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><msub><mtext>MU</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub><msub><mtext>P</mtext><mn>2</mn></msub></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nJeremy is deeply in love with Jasmine. Jasmine lives where cell phone coverage is poor, so he can either call her on the land-line phone for five cents per minute or he can drive to see her, at a round-trip cost of $2 in gasoline money. He has a total of $10 per week to spend on staying in touch. To make his preferred choice, Jeremy uses a handy utilimometer that measures his total utility from personal visits and from phone minutes. Using the values given in [[link]](#Table_06_06), figure out the points on Jeremy\u2019s consumption choice budget constraint (it may be helpful to do a sketch) and identify his utility-maximizing point.\n\n<table id=\"Table_06_06\" summary=\"The table has four columns labeled &#x201C;round trips,&#x201D; &#x201C;total utility,&#x201D; phone minutes,&#x201D; and &#x201C;total utility.&#x201D; The first two columns represent the total utility for round trips in the car. 0 round trips = 0 total utility; 1 round trip = 80 total utility; 2 round trips = 150 total utility; 3 = 210; 4 = 260; 5 = 300; 6 = 330; 7 = 200; 8 = 180; 9 = 160; 10 = 140.

One of the choices listed in the problem, the six round trips, is not even available on the budget set. If Jeremy has only $10 to spend and a round trip costs $2 and phone calls cost $0.05 per minute, he could spend his entire budget on five round trips but no phone calls or 200 minutes of phone calls, but no round trips or any combination of the two in between. It is easy to see all of his budget options with a little algebra.

How would you describe your thinking before you made that purchase?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rules of politics are not always the same as the rules of economics. In discussions of setting budgets for government agencies, there is a strategy called \u201cclosing the Washington monument.\u201d When an agency faces the unwelcome prospect of a budget cut, it may decide to close a high-visibility attraction enjoyed by many people (like the Washington monument). Explain in terms of diminishing marginal utility why the Washington monument strategy is so misleading. *Hint*: If you are really trying to make the best of a budget cut, should you cut the items in your budget with the highest marginal utility or the lowest marginal utility? Does the Washington monument strategy cut the items with the highest marginal utility or the lowest marginal utility?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nPraxilla, who lived in ancient Greece, derives utility from reading poems and from eating cucumbers. Praxilla gets 30 units of marginal utility from her first poem, 27 units of marginal utility from her second poem, 24 units of marginal utility from her third poem, and so on, with marginal utility declining by three units for each additional poem. Praxilla gets six units of marginal utility for each of her first three cucumbers consumed, five units of marginal utility for each of her next three cucumbers consumed, four units of marginal utility for each of the following three cucumbers consumed, and so on, with marginal utility declining by one for every three cucumbers consumed. A poem costs three bronze coins but a cucumber costs only one bronze coin. Praxilla has 18 bronze coins. Sketch Praxilla\u2019s budget set between poems and cucumbers, placing poems on the vertical axis and cucumbers on the horizontal axis. Start off with the choice of zero poems and 18 cucumbers, and calculate the changes in marginal utility of moving along the budget line to the next choice of one poem and 15 cucumbers. Using this step-by-step process based on marginal utility, create a table and identify Praxilla\u2019s utility-maximizing choice. Compare the marginal utility of the two goods and the relative prices at the optimal choice to see if the expected relationship holds. *Hint*: Label the table columns: 1) Choice, 2) Marginal Gain from More Poems, 3) Marginal Loss from Fewer Cucumbers, 4) Overall Gain or Loss, 5) Is the previous choice optimal? Label the table rows: 1) 0 Poems and 18 Cucumbers, 2) 1 Poem and 15 Cucumbers, 3) 2 Poems and 12 Cucumbers, 4) 3 Poems and 9 Cucumbers, 5) 4 Poems and 6 Cucumbers, 6) 5 Poems and 3 Cucumbers, 7) 6 Poems and 0 Cucumbers.\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2015. \u201cConsumer Expenditures in 2013.\u201d Accessed March 11, 2015. http://www.bls.gov/cex/csxann13.pdf.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2015. \u201cEmployer Costs for Employee Compensation\u2014December 2014.\u201d Accessed March 11, 2015. http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecec.pdf.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2015. \u201cLabor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey.\u201d Accessed March 11, 2015. http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat22.htm.\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nbudget constraint line\n: shows the possible combinations of two goods that are affordable given a consumer\u2019s limited income\n^\n\nconsumer equilibrium\n: when the ratio of the prices of goods is equal to the ratio of the marginal utilities (point at which the consumer can get the most satisfaction)\n^\n\ndiminishing marginal utility\n: the common pattern that each marginal unit of a good consumed provides less of an addition to utility than the previous unit\n^\n\nmarginal utility\n: the additional utility provided by one additional unit of consumption\n^\n\nmarginal utility per dollar\n: the additional satisfaction gained from purchasing a good given the price of the product; MU/Price\n^\n\ntotal utility\n: satisfaction derived from consumer choices", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

Indeed, because the budget constraint framework can be used to analyze how quantities demanded change because of price movements, the budget constraint model can illustrate the underlying logic behind demand curves.\n\n### How Changes in Income Affect Consumer Choices\n\nLet\u2019s begin with a concrete example illustrating how changes in income level affect consumer choices. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_002) shows a **budget constraint**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} that represents Kimberly\u2019s choice between concert tickets at $50 each and getting away overnight to a bed-and-breakfast for $200 per night. Kimberly has $1,000 per year to spend between these two choices. After thinking about her total utility and marginal utility and applying the decision rule that the ratio of the marginal utilities to the prices should be equal between the two products, Kimberly chooses point M, with eight concerts and three overnight getaways as her utility-maximizing choice.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C06_002 data-title=\"How a Change in Income Affects Consumption Choices \"}\n\nNow, assume that the income Kimberly has to spend on these two items rises to $2,000 per year, causing her budget constraint to shift out to the right. How does this rise in income alter her utility-maximizing choice? Kimberly will again consider the utility and marginal utility that she receives from concert tickets and overnight getaways and seek her **utility-maximizing choice**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} on the new budget line. But how will her new choice relate to her original choice?\n\nThe possible choices along the new budget constraint can be divided into three groups, which are divided up by the dashed horizontal and vertical lines that pass through the original choice M in the figure. All choices on the upper left of the new budget constraint that are to the left of the vertical dashed line, like choice P with two overnight stays and 32 concert tickets, involve less of the good on the horizontal axis but much more of the good on the vertical axis. All choices to the right of the vertical dashed line and above the horizontal dashed line\u2014like choice N with five overnight getaways and 20 concert tickets\u2014have more consumption of both goods. Finally, all choices that are to the right of the vertical dashed line but below the horizontal dashed line, like choice Q with four concerts and nine overnight getaways, involve less of the good on the vertical axis but much more of the good on the horizontal axis.\n\nAll of these choices are theoretically possible, depending on Kimberly\u2019s personal preferences as expressed through the total and marginal utility she would receive from consuming these two goods. When income rises, the most common reaction is to purchase more of both goods, like choice N, which is to the upper right relative to Kimberly\u2019s original choice M, although exactly how much more of each good will vary according to personal taste. Conversely, when income falls, the most typical reaction is to purchase less of both goods. As defined in the chapter on [Demand and Supply](/m48628) and again in the chapter on [Elasticity](/m48611){: .target-chapter}, goods and services are called **normal goods**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} when a rise in income leads to a rise in the quantity consumed of that good and a fall in income leads to a fall in quantity consumed.\n\nHowever, depending on Kimberly\u2019s preferences, a rise in income could cause consumption of one good to increase while consumption of the other good declines. A choice like P means that a rise in income caused her quantity consumed of overnight stays to decline, while a choice like Q would mean that a rise in income caused her quantity of concerts to decline. Goods where demand declines as income rises (or conversely, where the demand rises as income falls) are called \u201cinferior goods.\u201d An **inferior good**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} occurs when people trim back on a good as income rises, because they can now afford the more expensive choices that they prefer. For example, a higher-income household might eat fewer hamburgers or be less likely to buy a used car, and instead eat more steak and buy a new car.\n\n### How Price Changes Affect Consumer Choices\n\nFor analyzing the possible effect of a change in price on consumption, let\u2019s again use a concrete example. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_003) represents the consumer choice of Sergei, who chooses between purchasing baseball bats and cameras. A price increase for baseball bats would have no effect on the ability to purchase cameras, but it would reduce the number of bats Sergei could afford to buy. Thus a price increase for baseball bats, the good on the horizontal axis, causes the budget constraint to rotate inward, as if on a hinge, from the vertical axis. As in the previous section, the point labeled M represents the originally preferred point on the original budget constraint, which Sergei has chosen after contemplating his total utility and marginal utility and the tradeoffs involved along the budget constraint. In this example, the units along the horizontal and vertical axes are not numbered, so the discussion must focus on whether more or less of certain goods will be consumed, not on numerical amounts.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C06_003 data-title=\"How a Change in Price Affects Consumption Choices \"}\n\nAfter the price increase, Sergei will make a choice along the new budget constraint. Again, his choices can be divided into three segments by the dashed vertical and horizontal lines. In the upper left portion of the new budget constraint, at a choice like H, Sergei consumes more cameras and fewer bats. In the central portion of the new budget constraint, at a choice like J, he consumes less of both goods. At the right-hand end, at a choice like L, he consumes more bats but fewer cameras.\n\nThe typical response to higher prices is that a person chooses to consume less of the product with the higher price. This occurs for two reasons, and both effects can occur simultaneously. The **substitution effect**{: data-type=\"term\"} occurs when a price changes and consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price. The **income effect**{: data-type=\"term\"} is that a higher price means, in effect, the buying power of income has been reduced (even though actual income has not changed), which leads to buying less of the good (when the good is normal). In this example, the higher price for baseball bats would cause Sergei to buy a fewer bats for both reasons. Exactly how much will a higher price for bats cause Sergei consumption of bats to fall? [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_003) suggests a range of possibilities. Sergei might react to a higher price for baseball bats by purchasing the same quantity of bats, but cutting his consumption of cameras. This choice is the point K on the new budget constraint, straight below the original choice M. Alternatively, Sergei might react by dramatically reducing his purchases of bats and instead buy more cameras.\n\nThe key is that it would be imprudent to assume that a change in the price of baseball bats will only or primarily affect the good whose price is changed, while the quantity consumed of other goods remains the same. Since Sergei purchases all his products out of the same budget, a change in the price of one good can also have a range of effects, either positive or negative, on the quantity consumed of other goods.\n\nIn short, a higher price typically causes reduced consumption of the good in question, but it can affect the consumption of other goods as well.\n\n\nRead this [article][1] about the potential of variable prices in vending machines.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### The Foundations of Demand Curves\n\nChanges in the price of a good lead the budget constraint to shift. A shift in the budget constraint means that when individuals are seeking their highest utility, the quantity that is demanded of that good will change. In this way, the logical foundations of demand curves\u2014which show a connection between prices and quantity demanded\u2014are based on the underlying idea of individuals seeking utility. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_004) (a) shows a budget constraint with a choice between housing and \u201ceverything else.\u201d (Putting \u201ceverything else\u201d on the vertical axis can be a useful approach in some cases, especially when the focus of the analysis is on one particular good.) The preferred choice on the original budget constraint that provides the highest possible utility is labeled M<sub>0</sub>. The other three budget constraints represent successively higher prices for housing of P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>, and P<sub>3</sub>. As the budget constraint rotates in, and in, and in again, the utility-maximizing choices are labeled M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, and M<sub>3</sub>, and the quantity demanded of housing falls from Q<sub>0</sub> to Q<sub>1</sub> to Q<sub>2</sub> to Q<sub>3</sub>.\n\n  As the price increases from P0 to P1 to P2 to P3, the budget constraint on the upper part of the diagram shifts to the left. The utility-maximizing choice changes from M0 to M1 to M2 to M3. As a result, the quantity demanded of housing shifts from Q0 to Q1 to Q2 to Q3, ceteris paribus. (b) The demand curve graphs each combination of the price of housing and the quantity of housing demanded, ceteris paribus. Indeed, the quantities of housing are the same at the points on both (a) and (b). Thus, the original price of housing (P0) and the original quantity of housing (Q0) appear on the demand curve as point E0. The higher price of housing (P1) and the corresponding lower quantity demanded of housing (Q1) appear on the demand curve as point E1.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C06_004 data-title=\"The Foundations of a Demand Curve: An Example of Housing \"}\n\nSo, as the price of housing rises, the budget constraint shifts to the left, and the quantity consumed of housing falls, *ceteris paribus* (meaning, with all other things being the same). This relationship\u2014the price of housing rising from P<sub>0</sub> to P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub> to P<sub>3</sub>, while the quantity of housing demanded falls from Q<sub>0</sub> to Q<sub>1</sub> to Q<sub>2</sub> to Q<sub>3</sub>\u2014is graphed on the demand curve in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_004) (b). Indeed, the vertical dashed lines stretching between the top and bottom of [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_004) show that the quantity of housing demanded at each point is the same in both (a) and (b). The shape of a demand curve is ultimately determined by the underlying choices about maximizing utility subject to a budget constraint. And while economists may not be able to measure \u201cutils,\u201d they can certainly measure price and quantity demanded.\n\n### Applications in Government and Business \n\nThe budget constraint framework for making utility-maximizing choices offers a reminder that people can react to a change in price or income in a range of different ways. For example, in the winter months of 2005, costs for heating homes increased significantly in many parts of the country as prices for natural gas and electricity soared, due in large part to the disruption caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Some people reacted by reducing the quantity demanded of energy; for example, by turning down the thermostats in their homes by a few degrees and wearing a heavier sweater inside. Even so, many home heating bills rose, so people adjusted their consumption in other ways, too. As you learned in the chapter on [Elasticity](/m48611){: .target-chapter}, the short run demand for home heating is generally inelastic. Each household cut back on what it valued least on the margin; for some it might have been some dinners out, or a vacation, or postponing buying a new refrigerator or a new car. Indeed, sharply higher energy prices can have effects beyond the energy market, leading to a widespread reduction in purchasing throughout the rest of the economy.\n\nA similar issue arises when the government imposes taxes on certain products, like it does on gasoline, cigarettes, and alcohol. Say that a tax on alcohol leads to a higher price at the liquor store, the higher price of alcohol causes the budget constraint to pivot left, and consumption of alcoholic beverages is likely to decrease. However, people may also react to the higher price of alcoholic beverages by cutting back on other purchases. For example, they might cut back on snacks at restaurants like chicken wings and nachos. It would be unwise to assume that the liquor industry is the only one affected by the tax on alcoholic beverages. Read the next Clear It Up to learn about how buying decisions are influenced by who controls the household income.\n\n\n\nDoes who controls household income make a difference?\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the United Kingdom made an interesting policy change in its \u201cchild allowance\u201d policy. This program provides a fixed amount of money per child to every family, regardless of family income. Traditionally, the child allowance had been distributed to families by withholding less in taxes from the paycheck of the family wage earner\u2014typically the father in this time period. The new policy instead provided the child allowance as a cash payment to the mother. As a result of this change, households have the same level of income and face the same prices in the market, but the money is more likely to be in the purse of the mother than in the wallet of the father.\n\nShould this change in policy alter household consumption patterns? Basic models of consumption decisions, of the sort examined in this chapter, assume that it does not matter whether the mother or the father receives the money, because both parents seek to maximize the utility of the family as a whole. In effect, this model assumes that everyone in the family has the same preferences.\n\nIn reality, the share of income controlled by the father or the mother does affect what the household consumes. When the mother controls a larger share of family income a number of studies, in the United Kingdom and in a wide variety of other countries, have found that the family tends to spend more on restaurant meals, child care, and women\u2019s clothing, and less on alcohol and tobacco. As the mother controls a larger share of household resources, children\u2019s health improves, too. These findings suggest that when providing assistance to poor families, in high-income countries and low-income countries alike, the monetary amount of assistance is not all that matters: it also matters which member of the family actually receives the money.\n\n\n\nThe budget constraint framework serves as a constant reminder to think about the full range of effects that can arise from changes in income or price, not just effects on the one product that might seem most immediately affected.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe budget constraint framework suggest that when income or price changes, a range of responses are possible. When income rises, households will demand a higher quantity of normal goods, but a lower quantity of inferior goods. When the price of a good rises, households will typically demand less of that good\u2014but whether they will demand a much lower quantity or only a slightly lower quantity will depend on personal preferences. Also, a higher price for one good can lead to more or less of the other good being demanded.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nExplain all the reasons why a decrease in the price of a product would lead to an increase in purchases of the product.\n\n\n\nThis is the opposite of the example explained in the text. A decrease in price has a substitution effect and an income effect. The substitution effect says that because the product is cheaper relative to other things the consumer purchases, he or she will tend to buy more of the product (and less of the other things). The income effect says that after the price decline, the consumer could purchase the same goods as before, and still have money left over to purchase more. For both reasons, a decrease in price causes an increase in quantity demanded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a college student you work at a part-time job, but your parents also send you a monthly \u201callowance.\u201d Suppose one month your parents forgot to send the check. Show graphically how your budget constraint is affected. Assuming you only buy normal goods, what would happen to your purchases of goods?\n\n\n\nThis is a negative income effect. Because your parents\u2019 check failed to arrive, your monthly income is less than normal and your budget constraint shifts in toward the origin. If you only buy normal goods, the decrease in your income means you will buy less of every product.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nAs a general rule, is it safe to assume that a change in the price of a good will always have its most significant impact on the quantity demanded of that good, rather than on the quantity demanded of other goods? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does a change in income cause a parallel shift in the budget constraint?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nIncome effects depend on the income elasticity of demand for each good that you buy. If one of the goods you buy has a negative income elasticity, that is, it is an inferior good, what must be true of the income elasticity of the other good you buy?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nIf a 10% decrease in the price of one product that you buy causes an 8% increase in quantity demanded of that product, will another 10% decrease in the price cause another 8% increase (no more and no less) in quantity demanded?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nincome effect\n: a higher price means that, in effect, the buying power of income has been reduced, even though actual income has not changed; always happens simultaneously with a substitution effect\n^\n\nsubstitution effect\n: when a price changes, consumers have an incentive to consume less of the good with a relatively higher price and more of the good with a relatively lower price; always happens simultaneously with an income effect\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/vending", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

They also obtain utility from leisure time. Leisure time is time not spent at work.

Choices made along the **labor-leisure budget constraint**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, as wages shift, provide the logical underpinning for the labor supply curve. The discussion also offers some insights about the range of possible reactions when people receive higher wages, and specifically about the claim that if people are paid higher wages, they will work a greater quantity of hours\u2014assuming that they have a say in the matter.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. workers averaged 38.6 hours per week on the job in 2014. This average includes part-time workers; for full-time workers only, the average was 42.5 hours per week.

Wages and salaries are about three-quarters of total compensation received by workers; the rest is in the form of health insurance, vacation pay, and other benefits. The compensation workers receive differs for many reasons, including experience, education, skill, talent, membership in a labor union, and the presence of discrimination against certain groups in the labor market.

Again, let\u2019s proceed with a concrete example. The economic logic is precisely the same as in the case of a **consumption choice budget constraint**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, but the labels are different on a labor-leisure budget constraint.\n\nVivian has 70 hours per week that she could devote either to work or to leisure, and her wage is $10/hour. The lower budget constraint in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_005) shows Vivian\u2019s possible choices. The horizontal axis of this diagram measures both leisure and labor, by showing how Vivian\u2019s time is divided between leisure and labor. Hours of leisure are measured from left to right on the horizontal axis, while hours of labor are measured from right to left. Vivian will compare choices along this budget constraint, ranging from 70 hours of leisure and no income at point S to zero hours of leisure and $700 of income at point L. She will choose the point that provides her with the highest total utility. For this example, let\u2019s assume that Vivian\u2019s utility-maximizing choice occurs at O, with 30 hours of leisure, 40 hours of work, and $400 in weekly income.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C06_005 data-title=\"How a Rise in Wages Alters the Utility-Maximizing Choice \"}\n\nFor Vivian to discover the labor-leisure choice that will maximize her utility, she does not have to place numerical values on the total and marginal utility that she would receive from every level of income and leisure. All that really matters is that Vivian can compare, in her own mind, whether she would prefer more leisure or more income, given the tradeoffs she faces. If Vivian can say to herself: \u201cI\u2019d really rather work a little less and have more leisure, even if it means less income,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d be willing to work more hours to make some extra income,\u201d then as she gradually moves in the direction of her preferences, she will seek out the utility-maximizing choice on her labor-leisure budget constraint.\n\nNow imagine that Vivian\u2019s wage level increases to $12/hour. A higher wage will mean a new budget constraint that tilts up more steeply; conversely, a lower wage would have led to a new budget constraint that was flatter. How will a change in the wage and the corresponding shift in the budget constraint affect Vivian\u2019s decisions about how many hours to work?\n\nVivian\u2019s choices of quantity of hours to work and income along her new budget constraint can be divided into several categories, using the dashed horizontal and vertical lines in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_005) that go through her original choice (O). One set of choices in the upper-left portion of the new budget constraint involves more hours of work (that is, less leisure) and more income, at a point like A with 20 hours of leisure, 50 hours of work, and $600 of income (that is, 50 hours of work multiplied by the new wage of $12 per hour). A second choice would be to work exactly the same 40 hours, and to take the benefits of the higher wage in the form of income that would now be $480, at choice B. A third choice would involve more leisure and the same income at point C (that is, 33-1/3 hours of work multiplied by the new wage of $12 per hour equals $400 of total income). A fourth choice would involve less income and much more leisure at a point like D, with a choice like 50 hours of leisure, 20 hours of work, and $240 in income.\n\nIn effect, Vivian can choose whether to receive the benefits of her wage increase in the form of more income, or more leisure, or some mixture of these two. With this range of possibilities, it would be unwise to assume that Vivian (or anyone else) will necessarily react to a wage increase by working substantially more hours. Maybe they will; maybe they will not.\n\n### Applications of Utility Maximizing with the Labor-Leisure Budget Constraint\n\nThe theoretical insight that higher wages will sometimes cause an increase in hours worked, sometimes cause hours worked not to change by much, and sometimes cause hours worked to decline, has led to labor supply curves that look like the one in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_006). The bottom-left portion of the labor supply curve slopes upward, which reflects the situation of a person who reacts to a higher wage by supplying a greater quantity of labor. The middle, close-to-vertical portion of the labor supply curve reflects the situation of a person who reacts to a higher wage by supplying about the same quantity of labor. The very top portion of the labor supply curve is called a **backward-bending supply curve for labor**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is the situation of high-wage people who can earn so much that they respond to a still-higher wage by working fewer hours. Read the following Clear It Up feature for more on the number of hours the average person works each year.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C06_006 data-title=\"A Backward-Bending Supply Curve of Labor \"}\n\n\n\nIs America a nation of workaholics?\n\nAmericans work a lot. [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_12) shows average hours worked per year in the United States, Canada, Japan, and several European countries, with data from 2013. To get a perspective on these numbers, someone who works 40 hours per week for 50 weeks per year, with two weeks off, would work 2,000 hours per year. The gap in hours worked is a little astonishing; the 250 to 300 hour gap between how much Americans work and how much Germans or the French work amounts to roughly six to seven weeks less of work per year. Economists who study these international patterns debate the extent to which average Americans and Japanese have a preference for working more than, say, Germans, or whether German workers and employers face particular kinds of taxes and regulations that lead to fewer hours worked. Many countries have laws that regulate the work week and dictate holidays and the standards of \u201cnormal\u201d vacation time vary from country to country. It is also interesting to take the amount of time spent working in context; it is estimated that in the late nineteenth century in the United States, the average work week was over 60 hours per week\u2014leaving little to no time for leisure.\n\n<table id=\"Table_06_12\" summary=\"The table shows the average annual hours actually worked per employed person in various countries. The United States = 1,824. Spain = 1,799. Japan = 1,759. Canada = 1,751. The United Kingdom = 1,669. Sweden = 1,585. German = 1,443.

Many full-time workers have jobs where the number of hours is held relatively fixed, partly by their own choice and partly by their employer\u2019s practices. These workers do not much change their hours worked as wages rise or fall, so their supply curve of labor is inelastic. However, part-time workers and younger workers tend to be more flexible in their hours, and more ready to increase hours worked when wages are high or cut back when wages fall.\n\nThe backward-bending supply curve for labor, when workers react to higher wages by working fewer hours and having more income, is not observed often in the short run. However, some well-paid professionals, like dentists or accountants, may react to higher wages by choosing to limit the number of hours, perhaps by taking especially long vacations, or taking every other Friday off. Over a long-term perspective, the backward-bending supply curve for labor is common. Over the last century, Americans have reacted to gradually rising wages by working fewer hours; for example, the length of the average work-week has fallen from about 60 hours per week in 1900 to the present average of less than 40 hours per week.\n\nRecognizing that workers have a range of possible reactions to a change in wages casts some fresh insight on a perennial political debate: the claim that a reduction in income taxes\u2014which would, in effect, allow people to earn more per hour\u2014will encourage people to work more. The leisure-income budget set points out that this connection will not hold true for all workers. Some people, especially part-timers, may react to higher wages by working more. Many will work the same number of hours. Some people, especially those whose incomes are already high, may react to the tax cut by working *fewer* hours. Of course, cutting taxes may be a good or a bad idea for a variety of reasons, not just because of its impact on work incentives, but the specific claim that tax cuts will lead people to work more hours is only likely to hold for specific groups of workers and will depend on how and for whom taxes are cut.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nWhen making a choice along the labor-leisure budget constraint, a household will choose the combination of labor, leisure, and income that provides the most utility. The result of a change in wage levels can be higher work hours, the same work hours, or lower work hours.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nSiddhartha has 50 hours per week to devote to work or leisure.

Household decisions about the quantity of financial savings show the same underlying pattern of logic as the consumption choice decision and the labor-leisure decision.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C06_009 data-title=\"Personal Savings as a Percentage of Personal Income \"}\n\nThe discussion of financial saving here will not focus on the specific financial investment choices, like bank accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or owning a house or gold coins. The characteristics of these specific financial investments, along with the risks and tradeoffs they pose, are detailed in the [Labor and Financial Markets](/m48636){: .target-chapter} chapter. Here, the focus is saving in total\u2014that is, on how a household determines how much to consume in the present and how much to save, given the expected rate of return (or interest rate), and how the quantity of saving alters when the rate of return changes.\n\n### Using Marginal Utility to Make Intertemporal Choices\n\nSavings behavior varies considerably across households. One factor is that households with higher incomes tend to save a larger percentage of their income. This pattern makes intuitive sense; a well-to-do family has the flexibility in its budget to save 20\u201325% of income, while a poor family struggling to keep food on the table will find it harder to put money aside.\n\nAnother factor that causes personal saving to vary is personal preferences. Some people may prefer to consume more now, and let the future look after itself. Others may wish to enjoy a lavish retirement, complete with expensive vacations, or to pile up money that they can pass along to their grandchildren. There are savers and spendthrifts among the young, middle-aged, and old, and among those with high, middle, and low income levels.\n\nConsider this example: Yelberton is a young man starting off at his first job. He thinks of the \u201cpresent\u201d as his working life and the \u201cfuture\u201d as after retirement. Yelberton\u2019s plan is to save money from ages 30 to 60, retire at age 60, and then live off his retirement money from ages 60 to 85. On average, therefore, he will be saving for 30 years. If the rate of return that he can receive is 6% per year, then $1 saved in the present would build up to $5.74 after 30 years (using the formula for compound interest, $1(1 + 0.06)<sup>30</sup> = $5.74). Say that Yelberton will earn $1,000,000 over the 30 years from age 30 to age 60 (this amount is approximately an annual salary of $33,333 multiplied by 30 years). The question for Yelberton is how much of those lifetime earnings to consume during his working life, and how much to put aside until after retirement. This example is obviously built on simplifying assumptions, but it does convey the basic life-cycle choice of saving during working life for future consumption after retirement.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_008) and [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_16) show Yelberton\u2019s **intertemporal budget constraint**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Yelberton\u2019s choice involves comparing the utility of present consumption during his working life and future consumption after retirement. The rate of return that determines the slope of the intertemporal budget line between present consumption and future consumption in this example is the annual interest rate that he would earn on his savings, compounded over the 30 years of his working life. (For simplicity, we are assuming that any savings from current income will compound for 30 years.) Thus, in the lower budget constraint line on the figure, future consumption grows by increments of $574,000, because each time $100,000 is saved in the present, it compounds to $574,000 after 30 years at a 6% interest rate. If some of the numbers on the future consumption axis look bizarrely large, remember that this occurs because of the power of compound interest over substantial periods of time, and because the figure is grouping together all of Yelberton\u2019s saving for retirement over his lifetime.\n\n, the same present saving and higher future consumption (K), more present consumption and more future consumption (L), or more present consumption and the same future consumption (M).\"){: #CNX_Econ_C06_008 data-title=\"Yelberton&#x2019;s Choice: The Intertemporal Budget Set \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_06_16\" summary=\"The table shows the &#x201C;present consumption&#x201D; (column 1), &#x201C;present savings&#x201D; (column 2), &#x201C;future consumption (6% annual return)&#x201D; (column 3), and &#x201C;future consumption (9% annual return)&#x201D; (column 4).

For example, he will compare the utility he would receive from a choice like point A, with consumption of $1 million in the present, zero savings, and zero future consumption; point B, with present consumption of $800,000, savings of $200,000, and future consumption of $1,148,000; point C, with present consumption of $600,000, savings of $400,000, and future consumption of $2,296,000; or even choice D, with present consumption of zero, savings of $1,000,000, and future consumption of $5,740,000. Yelberton will also ask himself questions like these: \u201cWould I prefer to consume a little less in the present, save more, and have more future consumption?\u201d or \u201cWould I prefer to consume a little more in the present, save less, and have less future consumption?\u201d By considering marginal changes toward more or less consumption, he can seek out the choice that will provide him with the highest level of utility.\n\nLet us say that Yelberton\u2019s preferred choice is B. Imagine that Yelberton\u2019s annual rate of return raises from 6% to 9%. In this case, each time he saves $100,000 in the present, it will be worth $1,327,000 in 30 years from now (using the formula for compound interest that $100,000 (1 + 0.09)<sup>30</sup> = $1,327,000). A change in rate of return alters the slope of the intertemporal budget constraint: a higher rate of return or interest rate will cause the budget line to pivot upward, while a lower rate of return will cause it to pivot downward. If Yelberton were to consume nothing in the present and save all $1,000,000, with a 9% rate of return, his future consumption would be $13,270,000, as shown on [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_008).\n\nAs the rate of return rises, Yelberton considers a range of choices on the new intertemporal budget constraint. The dashed vertical and horizontal lines running through the original choice B help to illustrate his range of options. One choice is to reduce present consumption (that is, to save more) and to have considerably higher future consumption at a point like J above and to the left of his original choice B. A second choice would be to keep the level of present consumption and savings the same, and to receive the benefits of the higher rate of return entirely in the form of higher future consumption, which would be choice K.\n\nAs a third choice Yelberton could have both more present consumption\u2014that is, less savings\u2014but still have higher future consumption because of the higher interest rate, which would be choice like L, above and to the right of his original choice B. Thus, the higher rate of return might cause Yelberton to save more, or less, or the same amount, depending on his own preferences. A fourth choice would be that Yelberton could react to the higher rate of return by increasing his current consumption and leaving his future consumption unchanged, as at point M directly to the right of his original choice B. The actual choice of what quantity to save and how saving will respond to changes in the rate of return will vary from person to person, according to the choice that will maximize each person\u2019s utility.\n\n### Applications of the Model of Intertemporal Choice\n\nThe theoretical model of the intertemporal budget constraint suggests that when the rate of return rises, the quantity of saving may rise, fall, or remain the same, depending on the preferences of individuals. For the U.S. economy as a whole, the most common pattern seems to be that the quantity of savings does not adjust much to changes in the rate of return. As a practical matter, many households either save at a fairly steady pace, by putting regular contributions into a retirement account or by making regular payments as they buy a house, or they do not save much at all. Of course, some people will have preferences that cause them to react to a higher rate of return by increasing their quantity of saving; others will react to a higher rate of return by noticing that with a higher rate of return, they can save less in the present and still have higher future consumption.\n\nOne prominent example in which a higher rate of return leads to a lower savings rate occurs when firms save money because they have promised to pay workers a certain fixed level of pension benefits after retirement. When rates of return rise, those companies can save less money in the present in their pension fund and still have enough to pay the promised retirement benefits in the future.\n\nThis insight suggests some skepticism about political proposals to encourage higher savings by providing savers with a higher rate of return. For example, **Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **401(k)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} accounts are special savings accounts where the money going into the account is not taxed until it is taken out many years later, after retirement. The main difference between these accounts is that an IRA is usually set up by an individual, while a 401(k) needs to be set up through an employer. By not taxing savings in the present, the effect of an IRA or a 401(k) is to increase the return to saving in these accounts.\n\nIRA and 401(k) accounts have attracted a large quantity of savings since they became common in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In fact, the amount of IRAs rose from $239 million in 1992 to $3.7 billion in 2005 to over $5 billion in 2012, as per the Investment Company Institute, a national association of U.S. investment companies. However, overall U.S. personal savings, as discussed earlier, actually dropped from low to lower in the late 1990s and into the 2000s. Evidently, the larger amounts in these retirement accounts are being offset, in the economy as a whole, either by less savings in other kinds of accounts, or by a larger amount of borrowing (that is, negative savings). The following Clear It Up further explores America\\'s saving rates.\n\nA rise in interest rates makes it easier for people to enjoy higher future consumption. But it also allows them to enjoy higher present consumption, if that is what these individuals desire. Again, a change in prices\u2014in this case, in interest rates\u2014leads to a range of possible outcomes.\n\n\n\nHow does America\u2019s saving rates compare to other countries?\n\nBy international standards, Americans do not save a high proportion of their income, as [\\[link\\]](#Table_06_17) shows. The rate of gross national saving includes saving by individuals, businesses, and government. By this measure, U.S. national savings amount to 17% of the size of the U.S. GDP, which measures the size of the U.S. economy. The comparable world average rate of savings is 22%.\n\n<table id=\"Table_06_17\" summary=\"Alt text: This table has two columns and eleven rows.

The flexible and powerful terminology of utility-maximizing gives economists a vocabulary for bringing these elements together.\n\nNot even economists believe that people walk around mumbling about their marginal utilities before they walk into a shopping mall, accept a job, or make a deposit in a savings account. However, economists do believe that individuals seek their own satisfaction or utility and that people often decide to try a little less of one thing and a little more of another. If these assumptions are accepted, then the idea of utility-maximizing households facing budget constraints becomes highly plausible.\n\n### Behavioral Economics: An Alternative Viewpoint    {#eip-369}\n\nAs we know, people sometimes make decisions that seem \u201cirrational\u201d and not in their own best interest. People\u2019s decisions can seem inconsistent from one day to the next and they even deliberately ignore ways to save money or time. The traditional economic models assume rationality, which means that people take all available information and make consistent and informed decisions that are in their best interest. (In fact, economics professors often delight in pointing out so-called \u201cirrational behavior\u201d each semester to their new students, and present economics as a way to become more rational.)\n\nBut a new group of economists, known as behavioral economists, argue that the traditional method leaves out something important: people\u2019s state of mind. For example, one can think differently about money if one is feeling revenge, optimism, or loss. These are not necessarily irrational states of mind, but part of a range of emotions that can affect anyone on a given day. And what\u2019s more, actions under these conditions are indeed predictable, if the underlying environment is better understood. So, **behavioral economics**{: data-type=\"term\"} seeks to enrich the understanding of decision-making by integrating the insights of psychology into economics. It does this by investigating how given dollar amounts can mean different things to individuals depending on the situation. This can lead to decisions that appear outwardly inconsistent, or irrational, to the outside observer.\n\nThe way the mind works, according to this view, may seem inconsistent to traditional economists but is actually far more complex than an unemotional cost-benefit adding machine. For example, a traditional economist would say that if you lost a $10 bill today, and also got an extra $10 in your paycheck, you should feel perfectly neutral. After all, \u2013$10 + $10 = $0. You are the same financially as you were before. However, behavioral economists have done research that shows many people will feel some negative emotion\u2014anger, frustration, and so forth\u2014after those two things happen. We tend to focus more on the loss than the gain. This is known as **loss aversion**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, where a $1 loss pains us 2.25 times more than a $1 gain helps us, according to the economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a famous 1979 article in the journal *Econometrica*. This insight has implications for investing, as people tend to \u201coverplay\u201d the stock market by reacting more to losses than to gains. Indeed, this behavior looks irrational to traditional economists, but is consistent once we understand better how the mind works, these economists argue.\n\nTraditional economists also assume human beings have complete self-control. But, for instance, people will buy cigarettes by the pack instead of the carton even though the carton saves them money, to keep usage down. They purchase locks for their refrigerators and overpay on taxes to force themselves to save. In other words, we protect ourselves from our worst temptations but pay a price to do so. One way behavioral economists are responding to this is by setting up ways for people to keep themselves free of these temptations. This includes what are called \u201cnudges\u201d toward more rational behavior rather than mandatory regulations from government. For example, up to 20 percent of new employees do not enroll in retirement savings plans immediately, because of procrastination or feeling overwhelmed by the different choices. Some companies are now moving to a new system, where employees are automatically enrolled unless they \u201copt out.\u201d Almost no-one opts out in this program and employees begin saving at the early years, which are most critical for retirement.\n\nAnother area that seems illogical is the idea of mental accounting, or putting dollars in different mental categories where they take different values. Economists typically consider dollars to be **fungible**{: data-type=\"term\"}, or having equal value to the individual, regardless of the situation.\n\nYou might, for instance, think of the $25 you found in the street differently from the $25 you earned from three hours working in a fast food restaurant. The street money might well be treated as \u201cmad money\u201d with little rational regard to getting the best value. This is in one sense strange, since it is still equivalent to three hours of hard work in the restaurant. Yet the \u201ceasy come-easy go\u201d mentality replaces the rational economizer because of the situation, or context, in which the money was attained.\n\nIn another example of mental accounting that seems inconsistent to a traditional economist, a person could carry a credit card debt of $1,000 that has a 15% yearly interest cost, and simultaneously have a $2,000 savings account that pays only 2% per year. That means she pays $150 a year to the credit card company, while collecting only $40 annually in bank interest, so she loses $130 a year. That doesn\u2019t seem wise.\n\nThe \u201crational\u201d decision would be to pay off the debt, since a $1,000 savings account with $0 in debt is the equivalent net worth, and she would now net $20 per year. But curiously, it is not uncommon for people to ignore this advice, since they will treat a loss to their savings account as higher than the benefit of paying off their credit card. The dollars are not being treated as fungible so it looks irrational to traditional economists.\n\nWhich view is right, the behavioral economists\u2019 or the traditional view? Both have their advantages, but behavioral economists have at least shed a light on trying to describe and explain behavior that has historically been dismissed as irrational. If most of us are engaged in some \u201cirrational behavior,\u201d perhaps there are deeper underlying reasons for this behavior in the first place.\n\n\n\n\"Eeny, Meeny, Miney, Moe\"\u2014Making Choices\n\nIn what category did consumers worldwide increase their spending during the recession? Higher education. According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), enrollment in colleges and universities rose one-third in China and almost two-thirds in Saudi Arabia, nearly doubled in Pakistan, tripled in Uganda, and surged by three million\u201418 percent\u2014in the United States. Why were consumers willing to spend on education during lean times? Both individuals and countries view higher education as the way to prosperity. Many feel that increased earnings are a significant benefit of attending college.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics data from May 2012 supports this view, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C06_010). They show a positive correlation between earnings and education. The data also indicate that unemployment rates fall with higher levels of education and training.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C06_010 data-title=\"The Impact of Education on Earnings and Unemployment Rates, 2012 \"}\n\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nWhen making a choice along the intertemporal budget constraint, a household will choose the combination of present consumption, savings, and future consumption that provides the most utility. The result of a higher rate of return (or higher interest rates) can be a higher quantity of saving, the same quantity of saving, or a lower quantity of saving, depending on preferences about present and future consumption. Behavioral economics is a branch of economics that seeks to understand and explain the \\\"human\\\" factors that drive what traditional economists see as people\\'s irrational spending decisions.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nHow would an increase in expected income over one\u2019s lifetime affect one\u2019s intertemporal budget constraint? How would it affect one\u2019s consumption/saving decision?\n\n\n\nAn increase in expected income would cause an outward shift in the intertemporal budget constraint. This would likely increase both current consumption and saving, but the answer would depend on one\u2019s time preference, that is, how much one is willing to wait to forgo current consumption. Children are notoriously bad at this, which is to say they might simply consume more, and not save any. Adults, because they think about the future, are generally better at time preference\u2014that is, they are more willing to wait to receive a reward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would a decrease in expected interest rates over one\u2019s working life affect one\u2019s intertemporal budget constraint? How would it affect one\u2019s consumption/saving decision?\n\n\n\nLower interest rates would make lending cheaper and saving less rewarding. This would be reflected in a flatter intertemporal budget line, a rotation around the amount of current income. This would likely cause a decrease in saving and an increase in current consumption, though the results for any individual would depend on time preference.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nAccording to the model of intertemporal choice, what are the major factors which determine how much saving an individual will do? What factors might a behavioral economist use to explain savings decisions?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a general rule, is it safe to assume that a lower interest rate will encourage significantly lower financial savings for all individuals?

Prior to Amazon, books were primarily sold through independent bookstores with limited inventories in small retail locations. There were exceptions, of course; Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble offered larger stores in urban areas. In the last decade, however, independent bookstores have become few and far between, Borders has gone out of business, and Barnes &amp; Noble is struggling. Online delivery and purchase of books has indeed overtaken the more traditional business models. How has Amazon changed the book selling industry? How has it managed to crush its competition?\n\nA major reason for the giant retailer\u2019s success is its production model and cost structure, which has enabled Amazon to undercut the prices of its competitors even when factoring in the cost of shipping. Read on to see how firms great (like Amazon) and small (like your corner deli) determine what to sell, at what output and price.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Cost and Industry Structure\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Explicit and Implicit Costs, and Accounting and Economic Profit\n* The Structure of Costs in the Short Run\n* The Structure of Costs in the Long Run\n\n\n\nThis chapter is the first of four chapters that explore the *theory of the firm*. This theory explains that firms behave in much the same way as consumers behave. What does that mean? Let\u2019s define what is meant by the firm. A **firm**{: data-type=\"term\"} (or business) combines inputs of labor, capital, land, and raw or finished component materials to produce outputs. If the firm is successful, the outputs are more valuable than the inputs. This activity of **production**{: data-type=\"term\"} goes beyond manufacturing (i.e., making things). It includes any process or service that creates value, including transportation, distribution, wholesale and retail sales. Production involves a number of important decisions that define the behavior of firms. These decisions include, but are not limited to:\n\n* What product or products should the firm produce?\n* How should the products be produced (i.e., what production process should be used)?\n* How much output should the firm produce?\n* What price should the firm charge for its products?\n* How much labor should the firm employ?\n\nThe answers to these questions depend on the production and cost conditions facing each firm. The answers also depend on the structure of the market for the product(s) in question. Market structure is a multidimensional concept that involves how competitive the industry is. It is defined by questions such as these:\n\n* How much market power does each firm in the industry possess?\n* How similar is each firm\u2019s product to the products of other firms in the industry?\n* How difficult is it for new firms to enter the industry?\n* Do firms compete on the basis of price, advertising, or other product differences?\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_001) illustrates the range of different market structures, which we will explore in [Perfect Competition](/m48645){: .target-chapter}, [Monopoly](/m48650){: .target-chapter}, and [Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly](/m48658){: .target-chapter}.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C07_001 data-title=\"The Spectrum of Competition \"}\n\nFirst let\u2019s take a look at how firms determine their costs and desired profit levels.

When people think of businesses, often giants like Wal-Mart, Microsoft, or General Motors come to mind. But firms come in all sizes, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_07_01). The vast majority of American firms have fewer than 20 employees. As of 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau counted 5.7 million firms with employees in the U.S. economy. Slightly less than half of all the workers in private firms are at the 17,000 large firms, meaning they employ more than 500 workers. Another 35% of workers in the U.S. economy are at firms with fewer than 100 workers. These small-scale businesses include everything from dentists and lawyers to businesses that mow lawns or clean houses. Indeed, [\\[link\\]](#Table_07_01) does not include a separate category for the millions of small \u201cnon-employer\u201d businesses where a single owner or a few partners are not officially paid wages or a salary, but simply receive whatever they can earn.\n\n<table id=\"Table_07_01\" summary=\"U.S. firms with 0-9 employees make up 79.2% of firms and pay 11% of total employment.

It is calculated by multiplying the price of the product times the quantity of output sold:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Total\u00a0Revenue</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Price \u00d7 Quantity</mtext></math>\n\n\nWe will see in the following chapters that revenue is a function of the demand for the firm\u2019s products.\n\nWe can distinguish between two types of cost: explicit and implicit. **Explicit costs**{: data-type=\"term\"} are out-of-pocket costs, that is, payments that are actually made. Wages that a firm pays its employees or rent that a firm pays for its office are explicit costs. **Implicit costs**{: data-type=\"term\"} are more subtle, but just as important. They represent the opportunity cost of using resources already owned by the firm. Often for small businesses, they are resources contributed by the owners; for example, working in the business while not getting a formal salary, or using the ground floor of a home as a retail store. Implicit costs also allow for depreciation of goods, materials, and equipment that are necessary for a company to operate. (See the Work it Out feature for an extended example.)\n\nThese two definitions of cost are important for distinguishing between two conceptions of profit, accounting profit and economic profit. **Accounting profit**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a cash concept. It means total revenue minus explicit costs\u2014the difference between dollars brought in and dollars paid out. **Economic profit**{: data-type=\"term\"} is total revenue minus total cost, including both explicit and implicit costs. The difference is important because even though a business pays income taxes based on its accounting profit, whether or not it is economically successful depends on its economic profit.\n\n\n\nCalculating Implicit Costs\n\nConsider the following example. Fred currently works for a corporate law firm. He is considering opening his own legal practice, where he expects to earn $200,000 per year once he gets established. To run his own firm, he would need an office and a law clerk. He has found the perfect office, which rents for $50,000 per year. A law clerk could be hired for $35,000 per year. If these figures are accurate, would Fred\u2019s legal practice be profitable?\n\nStep 1. First you have to calculate the costs. You can take what you know about explicit costs and total them:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnalign=\"left center\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Office\u00a0rental</mtext><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0\u00a0 $50,000</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Law\u00a0clerk's\u00a0salary</mtext><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><munder><mtext>+$35,000</mtext><mtext>\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_</mtext></munder></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Total\u00a0explicit\u00a0costs</mtext><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$85,000</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 2. Subtracting the explicit costs from the revenue gives you the accounting profit.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnalign=\"left center\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Revenues</mtext><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>$200,000</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Explicit\u00a0costs</mtext><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><munder><mtext>\u2013$85,000</mtext><mtext>\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_</mtext></munder></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Accounting\u00a0profit</mtext><mo>:</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>$115,000</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nBut these calculations consider only the explicit costs. To open his own practice, Fred would have to quit his current job, where he is earning an annual salary of $125,000. This would be an implicit cost of opening his own firm.\n\nStep 3. You need to subtract both the explicit and implicit costs to determine the true economic profit:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Economic\u00a0profit</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>total\u00a0revenues\u00a0\u2013\u00a0explicit\u00a0costs\u00a0\u2013\u00a0implicit\u00a0costs</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>$200,000\u00a0\u2013\u00a0$85,000\u00a0\u2013\u00a0$125,000</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u2013$10,000\u00a0per\u00a0year</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nFred would be losing $10,000 per year. That does not mean he would not want to open his own business, but it does mean he would be earning $10,000 less than if he worked for the corporate firm.\n\nImplicit costs can include other things as well. Maybe Fred values his leisure time, and starting his own firm would require him to put in more hours than at the corporate firm. In this case, the lost leisure would also be an implicit cost that would subtract from economic profits.\n\n\n\nNow that we have an idea about the different types of costs, let\u2019s look at cost structures. A firm\u2019s cost structure in the long run may be different from that in the short run. We turn to that distinction in the next section.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nPrivately owned firms are motivated to earn profits. Profit is the difference between revenues and costs. While accounting profit considers only explicit costs, economic profit considers both explicit and implicit costs.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nA firm had sales revenue of $1 million last year. It spent $600,000 on labor, $150,000 on capital and $200,000 on materials. What was the firm\u2019s accounting profit?\n\n\n\nAccounting profit = total revenues minus explicit costs = $1,000,000 \u2013 ($600,000 + $150,000 + $200,000) = $50,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing from [[link]](#fs-idm18450688), the firm\u2019s factory sits on land owned by the firm that could be rented out for $30,000 per year. What was the firm\u2019s economic profit last year?\n\n\n\nEconomic profit = accounting profit minus implicit cost = $50,000 \u2013 $30,000 = $20,000.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are explicit and implicit costs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould an interest payment on a loan to a firm be considered an explicit or implicit cost?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between accounting and economic profit?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nSmall \u201cMom and Pop firms,\u201d like inner city grocery stores, sometimes exist even though they do not earn economic profits. How can you explain this?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nA firm is considering an investment that will earn a 6% rate of return. If it were to borrow the money, it would have to pay 8% interest on the loan, but it currently has the cash, so it will not need to borrow. Should the firm make the investment?

A list of the costs involved in producing cars will look very different from the costs involved in producing computer software or haircuts or fast-food meals. However, the cost structure of all firms can be broken down into some common underlying patterns. When a firm looks at its **total costs**{: data-type=\"term\"} of production in the short run, a useful starting point is to divide total costs into two categories: fixed costs that cannot be changed in the short run and variable costs that can be changed.\n\n### Fixed and Variable Costs\n\n**Fixed costs**{: data-type=\"term\"} are expenditures that do not change regardless of the level of production, at least not in the short term. Whether you produce a lot or a little, the fixed costs are the same. One example is the rent on a factory or a retail space. Once you sign the lease, the rent is the same regardless of how much you produce, at least until the lease runs out. Fixed costs can take many other forms: for example, the cost of machinery or equipment to produce the product, research and development costs to develop new products, even an expense like advertising to popularize a brand name. The level of fixed costs varies according to the specific line of business: for instance, manufacturing computer chips requires an expensive factory, but a local moving and hauling business can get by with almost no fixed costs at all if it rents trucks by the day when needed.\n\n**Variable costs**{: data-type=\"term\"}, on the other hand, are incurred in the act of producing\u2014the more you produce, the greater the variable cost. Labor is treated as a variable cost, since producing a greater quantity of a good or service typically requires more workers or more work hours. Variable costs would also include raw materials.\n\nAs a concrete example of fixed and variable costs, consider the barber shop called \u201cThe Clip Joint\u201d shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_002). The data for output and costs are shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_07_02). The fixed costs of operating the barber shop, including the space and equipment, are $160 per day. The variable costs are the costs of hiring barbers, which in our example is $80 per barber each day. The first two columns of the table show the quantity of haircuts the barbershop can produce as it hires additional barbers. The third column shows the fixed costs, which do not change regardless of the level of production. The fourth column shows the variable costs at each level of output. These are calculated by taking the amount of labor hired and multiplying by the wage. For example, two barbers cost: 2 \u00d7 $80 = $160. Adding together the fixed costs in the third column and the variable costs in the fourth column produces the total costs in the fifth column. So, for example, with two barbers the total cost is: $160 + $160 = $320.\n\n<table id=\"Table_07_02\" summary=\"This table has 5 columns and 7 rows of data. The following information reflects the data within each column from top to bottom. Column 1 shows Labor 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Column 2 shows Quantity 16, 40, 60, 72, 80, 84, 82.

The fixed costs are always shown as the vertical intercept of the total cost curve; that is, they are the costs incurred when output is zero so there are no variable costs.\n\nYou can see from the graph that once production starts, total costs and variable costs rise. While variable costs may initially increase at a decreasing rate, at some point they begin increasing at an increasing rate. This is caused by diminishing marginal returns, discussed in the chapter on [Choice in a World of Scarcity](/m48602){: .target-chapter}, which is easiest to see with an example. As the number of barbers increases from zero to one in the table, output increases from 0 to 16 for a marginal gain of 16; as the number rises from one to two barbers, output increases from 16 to 40, a marginal gain of 24. From that point on, though, the marginal gain in output diminishes as each additional barber is added. For example, as the number of barbers rises from two to three, the marginal output gain is only 20; and as the number rises from three to four, the marginal gain is only 12.\n\nTo understand the reason behind this pattern, consider that a one-man barber shop is a very busy operation. The single barber needs to do everything: say hello to people entering, answer the phone, cut hair, sweep up, and run the cash register. A second barber reduces the level of disruption from jumping back and forth between these tasks, and allows a greater division of labor and specialization. The result can be greater increasing marginal returns. However, as other barbers are added, the advantage of each additional barber is less, since the specialization of labor can only go so far. The addition of a sixth or seventh or eighth barber just to greet people at the door will have less impact than the second one did. This is the pattern of diminishing marginal returns. As a result, the total costs of production will begin to rise more rapidly as output increases. At some point, you may even see negative returns as the additional barbers begin bumping elbows and getting in each other\u2019s way. In this case, the addition of still more barbers would actually cause output to decrease, as shown in the last row of [\\[link\\]](#Table_07_02).\n\nThis pattern of **diminishing marginal returns**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is common in production. As another example, consider the problem of irrigating a crop on a farmer\u2019s field. The plot of land is the fixed factor of production, while the water that can be added to the land is the key variable cost. As the farmer adds water to the land, output increases. But adding more and more water brings smaller and smaller increases in output, until at some point the water floods the field and actually reduces output. Diminishing marginal returns occur because, at a given level of fixed costs, each additional input contributes less and less to overall production.\n\n### Average Total Cost, Average Variable Cost, Marginal Cost\n\nThe breakdown of total costs into fixed and variable costs can provide a basis for other insights as well. The first five columns of [\\[link\\]](#Table_07_03) duplicate the previous table, but the last three columns show average total costs, average variable costs, and marginal costs. These new measures analyze costs on a per-unit (rather than a total) basis and are reflected in the curves shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_003).\n\n is calculated by dividing total cost by the total quantity produced. The average total cost curve is typically U-shaped. Average variable cost (AVC) is calculated by dividing variable cost by the quantity produced. The average variable cost curve lies below the average total cost curve and is typically U-shaped or upward-sloping. Marginal cost (MC) is calculated by taking the change in total cost between two levels of output and dividing by the change in output. The marginal cost curve is upward-sloping.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C07_003 data-title=\"Cost Curves at the Clip Joint \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_07_03\" summary=\"\"><caption><span data-type=\"title\">Different Types of Costs</span></caption><thead>\n<tr>\n\t<th>Labor</th>\n\t<th>Quantity</th>\n\t<th>Fixed Cost</th>\n\t<th>Variable Cost</th>\n\t<th>Total Cost</th>\n\t<th>Marginal Cost</th>\n\t<th>Average Total Cost</th>\n\t<th>Average Variable Cost</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td>1</td>\n          <td>16</td>\n          <td>$160</td>\n          <td>$80</td>\n          <td>$240</td>\n          <td>$5.00</td>\n          <td>$15.00</td>\n          <td>$5.00</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>2</td>\n          <td>40</td>\n          <td>$160</td>\n          <td>$160</td>\n          <td>$320</td>\n          <td>$3.30</td>\n          <td>$8.00</td>\n          <td>$4.00</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>3</td>\n          <td>60</td>\n          <td>$160</td>\n          <td>$240</td>\n          <td>$400</td>\n          <td>$4.00</td>\n          <td>$6.60</td>\n          <td>$4.00</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>4</td>\n          <td>72</td>\n          <td>$160</td>\n          <td>$320</td>\n          <td>$480</td>\n          <td>$6.60</td>\n          <td>$6.60</td>\n          <td>$4.40</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>5</td>\n          <td>80</td>\n          <td>$160</td>\n          <td>$400</td>\n          <td>$560</td>\n          <td>$10.00</td>\n          <td>$7.00</td>\n          <td>$5.00</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>6</td>\n          <td>84</td>\n          <td>$160</td>\n          <td>$480</td>\n          <td>$640</td>\n          <td>$20.00</td>\n          <td>$7.60</td>\n          <td>$5.70</td>\n        </tr>\n\n\n      </tbody></table>\n\n**Average total cost**{: data-type=\"term\"} (sometimes referred to simply as average cost) is total cost divided by the quantity of output. Since the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $320, the average total cost for producing each of 40 haircuts is $320/40, or $8 per haircut. Average cost curves are typically U-shaped, as [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_003) shows. Average total cost starts off relatively high, because at low levels of output total costs are dominated by the fixed cost; mathematically, the denominator is so small that average total cost is large. Average total cost then declines, as the fixed costs are spread over an increasing quantity of output. In the average cost calculation, the rise in the numerator of total costs is relatively small compared to the rise in the denominator of quantity produced. But as output expands still further, the average cost begins to rise. At the right side of the average cost curve, total costs begin rising more rapidly as diminishing returns kick in.\n\n**Average variable cost**{: data-type=\"term\"} obtained when variable cost is divided by quantity of output. For example, the variable cost of producing 80 haircuts is $400, so the average variable cost is $400/80, or $5 per haircut. Note that at any level of output, the average variable cost curve will always lie below the curve for average total cost, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_003). The reason is that average total cost includes average variable cost and average fixed cost. Thus, for Q = 80 haircuts, the average total cost is $8 per haircut, while the average variable cost is $5 per haircut. However, as output grows, fixed costs become relatively less important (since they do not rise with output), so average variable cost sneaks closer to average cost.\n\nAverage total and variable costs measure the average costs of producing some quantity of output. Marginal cost is somewhat different. **Marginal cost**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output. So it is not the cost per unit of *all* units being produced, but only the next one (or next few). Marginal cost can be calculated by taking the change in total cost and dividing it by the change in quantity. For example, as quantity produced increases from 40 to 60 haircuts, total costs rise by 400 \u2013 320, or 80. Thus, the marginal cost for each of those marginal 20 units will be 80/20, or $4 per haircut. The marginal cost curve is generally upward-sloping, because diminishing marginal returns implies that additional units are more costly to produce. A small range of increasing marginal returns can be seen in the figure as a dip in the marginal cost curve before it starts rising. There is a point at which marginal and average costs meet, as the following Clear it Up feature discusses.\n\n\n\nWhere do marginal and average costs meet?\n\nThe marginal cost line intersects the average cost line exactly at the bottom of the average cost curve\u2014which occurs at a quantity of 72 and cost of $6.60 in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_003). The reason why the intersection occurs at this point is built into the economic meaning of marginal and average costs. If the marginal cost of production is below the average cost for producing previous units, as it is for the points to the left of where MC crosses ATC, then producing one more additional unit will reduce average costs overall\u2014and the ATC curve will be downward-sloping in this zone. Conversely, if the marginal cost of production for producing an additional unit is above the average cost for producing the earlier units, as it is for points to the right of where MC crosses ATC, then producing a marginal unit will increase average costs overall\u2014and the ATC curve must be upward-sloping in this zone. The point of transition, between where MC is pulling ATC down and where it is pulling it up, must occur at the minimum point of the ATC curve.\n\nThis idea of the marginal cost \u201cpulling down\u201d the average cost or \u201cpulling up\u201d the average cost may sound abstract, but think about it in terms of your own grades. If the score on the most recent quiz you take is lower than your average score on previous quizzes, then the marginal quiz pulls down your average. If your score on the most recent quiz is higher than the average on previous quizzes, the marginal quiz pulls up your average. In this same way, low marginal costs of production first pull down average costs and then higher marginal costs pull them up.\n\n\n\nThe numerical calculations behind average cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost will change from firm to firm. However, the general patterns of these curves, and the relationships and economic intuition behind them, will not change.\n\n### Lessons from Alternative Measures of Costs\n\nBreaking down total costs into fixed cost, marginal cost, average total cost, and average variable cost is useful because each statistic offers its own insights for the firm.\n\nWhatever the firm\u2019s quantity of production, total revenue must exceed total costs if it is to earn a profit. As explored in the chapter [Choice in a World of Scarcity](/m48602){: .target-chapter}, fixed costs are often **sunk costs**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} that cannot be recouped. In thinking about what to do next, sunk costs should typically be ignored, since this spending has already been made and cannot be changed. However, variable costs can be changed, so they convey information about the firm\u2019s ability to cut costs in the present and the extent to which costs will increase if production rises.\n\n\n\nWhy are total cost and average cost not on the same graph?\n\nTotal cost, fixed cost, and variable cost each reflect different aspects of the cost of production over the entire quantity of output being produced. These costs are measured in dollars. In contrast, marginal cost, average cost, and average variable cost are costs per unit. In the previous example, they are measured as cost per haircut. Thus, it would not make sense to put all of these numbers on the same graph, since they are measured in different units ($ versus $ per unit of output).\n\nIt would be as if the vertical axis measured two different things. In addition, as a practical matter, if they were on the same graph, the lines for marginal cost, average cost, and average variable cost would appear almost flat against the horizontal axis, compared to the values for total cost, fixed cost, and variable cost. Using the figures from the previous example, the total cost of producing 40 haircuts is $320. But the average cost is $320/40, or $8. If you graphed both total and average cost on the same axes, the average cost would hardly show.\n\n\n\nAverage cost tells a firm whether it can earn profits given the current price in the market. If we divide profit by the quantity of output produced we get **average profit**{: data-type=\"term\"}, also known as the firm\u2019s *profit margin*. Expanding the equation for profit gives:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px 2px 2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>average\u00a0profit</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>profit</mtext><mtext>quantity\u00a0produced</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>total\u00a0revenue\u00a0\u2013\u00a0total\u00a0cost</mtext><mtext>quantity\u00a0produced</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>total\u00a0revenue</mtext><mtext>quantity\u00a0produced</mtext></mfrac><mo>\u2013</mo><mfrac><mtext>total\u00a0cost</mtext><mtext>quantity\u00a0produced</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>average\u00a0revenue\u00a0\u2013\u00a0average\u00a0cost</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nBut note that:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px 2px 2px\" columnalign=\"left center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>average\u00a0revenue</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>price\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0quantity\u00a0produced</mtext><mtext>quantity\u00a0produced</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>price</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nThus:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>average\u00a0profit</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mtext>price \u2013 average\u00a0cost</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nThis is the firm\u2019s **profit margin**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. This definition implies that if the market price is above average cost, average profit, and thus total profit, will be positive; if price is below average cost, then profits will be negative.\n\nThe marginal cost of producing an additional unit can be compared with the marginal revenue gained by selling that additional unit to reveal whether the additional unit is adding to total profit\u2014or not. Thus, marginal cost helps producers understand how profits would be affected by increasing or decreasing production.\n\n### A Variety of Cost Patterns\n\nThe pattern of costs varies among industries and even among firms in the same industry. Some businesses have high fixed costs, but low marginal costs. Consider, for example, an Internet company that provides medical advice to customers. Such a company might be paid by consumers directly, or perhaps hospitals or healthcare practices might subscribe on behalf of their patients. Setting up the website, collecting the information, writing the content, and buying or leasing the computer space to handle the web traffic are all fixed costs that must be undertaken before the site can work. However, when the website is up and running, it can provide a high quantity of service with relatively low variable costs, like the cost of monitoring the system and updating the information. In this case, the total cost curve might start at a high level, because of the high fixed costs, but then might appear close to flat, up to a large quantity of output, reflecting the low variable costs of operation. If the website is popular, however, a large rise in the number of visitors will overwhelm the website, and increasing output further could require a purchase of additional computer space.\n\nFor other firms, fixed costs may be relatively low. For example, consider firms that rake leaves in the fall or shovel snow off sidewalks and driveways in the winter. For fixed costs, such firms may need little more than a car to transport workers to homes of customers and some rakes and shovels. Still other firms may find that diminishing marginal returns set in quite sharply. If a manufacturing plant tried to run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, little time remains for routine maintenance of the equipment, and marginal costs can increase dramatically as the firm struggles to repair and replace overworked equipment.\n\nEvery firm can gain insight into its task of earning profits by dividing its total costs into fixed and variable costs, and then using these calculations as a basis for average total cost, average variable cost, and marginal cost. However, making a final decision about the profit-maximizing quantity to produce and the price to charge will require combining these perspectives on cost with an analysis of sales and revenue, which in turn requires looking at the market structure in which the firm finds itself. Before we turn to the analysis of market structure in other chapters, we will analyze the firm\u2019s cost structure from a long-run perspective.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nIn a short-run perspective, a firm\u2019s total costs can be divided into fixed costs, which a firm must incur before producing any output, and variable costs, which the firm incurs in the act of producing. Fixed costs are sunk costs; that is, because they are in the past and cannot be altered, they should play no role in economic decisions about future production or pricing. Variable costs typically show diminishing marginal returns, so that the marginal cost of producing higher levels of output rises.\n\nMarginal cost is calculated by taking the change in total cost (or the change in variable cost, which will be the same thing) and dividing it by the change in output, for each possible change in output. Marginal costs are typically rising. A firm can compare marginal cost to the additional revenue it gains from selling another unit to find out whether its marginal unit is adding to profit.\n\nAverage total cost is calculated by taking total cost and dividing by total output at each different level of output. Average costs are typically U-shaped on a graph. If a firm\u2019s average cost of production is lower than the market price, a firm will be earning profits.\n\nAverage variable cost is calculated by taking variable cost and dividing by the total output at each level of output. Average variable costs are typically U-shaped. If a firm\u2019s average variable cost of production is lower than the market price, then the firm would be earning profits if fixed costs are left out of the picture.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nThe WipeOut Ski Company manufactures skis for beginners.

What will be the company\u2019s profits or losses?\n2.  How can you tell at a glance whether the company is making or losing money at this price by looking at average cost?\n3.  At the given quantity and price, is the marginal unit produced adding to profits?\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  Total revenues in this example will be a quantity of five units multiplied by the price of $25/unit, which equals $125. Total costs when producing five units are $130. Thus, at this level of quantity and output the firm experiences losses (or negative profits) of $5.\n2.  If price is less than average cost, the firm is not making a profit. At an output of five units, the average cost is $26/unit. Thus, at a glance you can see the firm is making losses. At a second glance, you can see that it must be losing $1 for each unit produced (that is, average cost of $26/unit minus the price of $25/unit). With five units produced, this observation implies total losses of $5.\n3.  When producing five units, marginal costs are $30/unit. Price is $25/unit. Thus, the marginal unit is not adding to profits, but is actually subtracting from profits, which suggests that the firm should reduce its quantity produced.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between fixed costs and variable costs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there fixed costs in the long-run?

The long run depends on the specifics of the firm in question\u2014it is not a precise period of time. If you have a one-year lease on your factory, then the long run is any period longer than a year, since after a year you are no longer bound by the lease. No costs are fixed in the long run. A firm can build new factories and purchase new machinery, or it can close existing facilities. In planning for the long run, the firm will compare alternative **production technologies**{: data-type=\"term\"} (or processes).\n\nIn this context, technology refers to all alternative methods of combining inputs to produce outputs. It does not refer to a specific new invention like the tablet computer. The firm will search for the production technology that allows it to produce the desired level of output at the lowest cost. After all, lower costs lead to higher profits\u2014at least if total revenues remain unchanged. Moreover, each firm must fear that if it does not seek out the lowest-cost methods of production, then it may lose sales to competitor firms that find a way to produce and sell for less.\n\n### Choice of Production Technology\n\nMany tasks can be performed with a range of combinations of labor and physical capital. For example, a firm can have human beings answering phones and taking messages, or it can invest in an automated voicemail system. A firm can hire file clerks and secretaries to manage a system of paper folders and file cabinets, or it can invest in a computerized recordkeeping system that will require fewer employees. A firm can hire workers to push supplies around a factory on rolling carts, it can invest in motorized vehicles, or it can invest in robots that carry materials without a driver. Firms often face a choice between buying a many small machines, which need a worker to run each one, or buying one larger and more expensive machine, which requires only one or two workers to operate it. In short, physical capital and labor can often substitute for each other.\n\nConsider the example of a private firm that is hired by local governments to clean up public parks. Three different combinations of labor and physical capital for cleaning up a single average-sized park appear in [\\[link\\]](#Table_07_06). The first production technology is heavy on workers and light on machines, while the next two technologies substitute machines for workers. Since all three of these production methods produce the same thing\u2014one cleaned-up park\u2014a profit-seeking firm will choose the production technology that is least expensive, given the prices of labor and machines.\n\n<table id=\"Table_07_06\" summary=\"Production technology 1 has 10 workers and 2 machines.

In this case, technology 1 is the low-cost production technology. In example B, wages rise to $55, while the cost of machines does not change, in which case technology 2 is the low-cost production technology. If wages keep rising up to $90, while the cost of machines remains unchanged, then technology 3 clearly becomes the low-cost form of production, as shown in example C.\n\nThis example shows that as an input becomes more expensive (in this case, the labor input), firms will attempt to conserve on using that input and will instead shift to other inputs that are relatively less expensive. This pattern helps to explain why the demand curve for labor (or any input) slopes down; that is, as labor becomes relatively more expensive, profit-seeking firms will seek to substitute the use of other inputs. When a multinational employer like Coca-Cola or McDonald\u2019s sets up a bottling plant or a restaurant in a high-wage economy like the United States, Canada, Japan, or Western Europe, it is likely to use production technologies that conserve on the number of workers and focuses more on machines. However, that same employer is likely to use production technologies with more workers and less machinery when producing in a lower-wage country like Mexico, China, or South Africa.\n\n### Economies of Scale\n\nOnce a firm has determined the least costly production technology, it can consider the optimal scale of production, or quantity of output to produce. Many industries experience economies of scale. **Economies of scale**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} refers to the situation where, as the quantity of output goes up, the cost per unit goes down. This is the idea behind \u201cwarehouse stores\u201d like Costco or Walmart. In everyday language: a larger factory can produce at a lower average cost than a smaller factory.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_004) illustrates the idea of economies of scale, showing the average cost of producing an alarm clock falling as the quantity of output rises. For a small-sized factory like S, with an output level of 1,000, the average cost of production is $12 per alarm clock. For a medium-sized factory like M, with an output level of 2,000, the average cost of production falls to $8 per alarm clock. For a large factory like L, with an output of 5,000, the average cost of production declines still further to $4 per alarm clock.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C07_004 data-title=\"Economies of Scale \"}\n\nThe average cost curve in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_004) may appear similar to the average cost curves presented earlier in this chapter, although it is downward-sloping rather than U-shaped. But there is one major difference. The economies of scale curve is a long-run average cost curve, because it allows all factors of production to change. The short-run average cost curves presented earlier in this chapter assumed the existence of fixed costs, and only variable costs were allowed to change.\n\nOne prominent example of economies of scale occurs in the chemical industry. Chemical plants have a lot of pipes. The cost of the materials for producing a pipe is related to the circumference of the pipe and its length. However, the volume of chemicals that can flow through a pipe is determined by the cross-section area of the pipe. The calculations in [\\[link\\]](#Table_07_08) show that a pipe which uses twice as much material to make (as shown by the circumference of the pipe doubling) can actually carry four times the volume of chemicals because the cross-section area of the pipe rises by a factor of four (as shown in the Area column).\n\n<table id=\"Table_07_08\" summary=\"A 4-inch pipe has a circumference (2 x pi x r) of 12.5 inches and an area (pi x r squared) of 12.5 square inches. An 8-inch pipe has a circumference of 25.1 inches and an area of 50.2 square inches. A 16-inch pip has a circumference of 50.2 inches and an area of 201.1 square inches. \"><caption><span data-type=\"title\">Comparing Pipes: Economies of Scale in the Chemical Industry</span></caption><thead>\n<tr>\n\t<th />\n\t<th>Circumference (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mn>2</mn><mi>\u03c0</mi><mi>r</mi></math>)</th>\n\t<th>Area (<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>\u03c0</mi><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></math>)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td>4-inch pipe</td>\n          <td>12.5 inches</td>\n          <td>12.5 square inches</td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>8-inch pipe</td>\n          <td>25.1 inches</td>\n          <td>50.2 square inches</td>\n        </tr>\n\n\n        <tr>\n          <td>16-inch pipe</td>\n          <td>50.2 inches</td>\n          <td>201.1 square inches</td>\n        </tr>\n\n      </tbody></table>\n\nA doubling of the cost of producing the pipe allows the chemical firm to process four times as much material. This pattern is a major reason for economies of scale in chemical production, which uses a large quantity of pipes. Of course, economies of scale in a chemical plant are more complex than this simple calculation suggests. But the chemical engineers who design these plants have long used what they call the \u201csix-tenths rule,\u201d a rule of thumb which holds that increasing the quantity produced in a chemical plant by a certain percentage will increase total cost by only six-tenths as much.\n\n### Shapes of Long-Run Average Cost Curves\n\nWhile in the short run firms are limited to operating on a single average cost curve (corresponding to the level of fixed costs they have chosen), in the long run when all costs are variable, they can choose to operate on any average cost curve. Thus, the **long-run average cost (LRAC) curve**{: data-type=\"term\"} is actually based on a group of **short-run average cost (SRAC) curves**{: data-type=\"term\"}, each of which represents one specific level of fixed costs. More precisely, the long-run average cost curve will be the least expensive average cost curve for any level of output. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_005) shows how the long-run average cost curve is built from a group of short-run average cost curves. Five short-run-average cost curves appear on the diagram. Each SRAC curve represents a different level of fixed costs. For example, you can imagine SRAC<sub>1</sub> as a small factory, SRAC<sub>2</sub> as a medium factory, SRAC<sub>3</sub> as a large factory, and SRAC<sub>4</sub> and SRAC<sub>5</sub> as very large and ultra-large. Although this diagram shows only five SRAC curves, presumably there are an infinite number of other SRAC curves between the ones that are shown. This family of short-run average cost curves can be thought of as representing different choices for a firm that is planning its level of investment in fixed cost physical capital\u2014knowing that different choices about capital investment in the present will cause it to end up with different short-run average cost curves in the future.\n\n curves each represents a different level of fixed costs, from the low level of fixed costs at SRAC1 to the high level of fixed costs at SRAC5. Other SRAC curves, not shown in the diagram, lie between the ones that are shown here. The long-run average cost (LRAC) curve shows the lowest cost for producing each quantity of output when fixed costs can vary, and so it is formed by the bottom edge of the family of SRAC curves. If a firm wished to produce quantity Q3, it would choose the fixed costs associated with SRAC3.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C07_005 data-title=\"From Short-Run Average Cost Curves to Long-Run Average Cost Curves \"}\n\nThe long-run average cost curve shows the cost of producing each quantity in the long run, when the firm can choose its level of fixed costs and thus choose which short-run average costs it desires. If the firm plans to produce in the long run at an output of Q<sub>3</sub>, it should make the set of investments that will lead it to locate on SRAC<sub>3</sub>, which allows producing q<sub>3</sub> at the lowest cost. A firm that intends to produce Q<sub>3</sub> would be foolish to choose the level of fixed costs at SRAC<sub>2</sub> or SRAC<sub>4</sub>. At SRAC<sub>2</sub> the level of fixed costs is too low for producing Q<sub>3</sub> at lowest possible cost, and producing q<sub>3</sub> would require adding a very high level of variable costs and make the average cost very high. At SRAC<sub>4</sub>, the level of fixed costs is too high for producing q<sub>3</sub> at lowest possible cost, and again average costs would be very high as a result.\n\nThe shape of the long-run cost curve, as drawn in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_005), is fairly common for many industries. The left-hand portion of the long-run average cost curve, where it is downward- sloping from output levels Q<sub>1</sub> to Q<sub>2</sub> to Q<sub>3</sub>, illustrates the case of economies of scale. In this portion of the long-run average cost curve, larger scale leads to lower average costs. This pattern was illustrated earlier in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_004).\n\nIn the middle portion of the long-run average cost curve, the flat portion of the curve around Q<sub>3</sub>, economies of scale have been exhausted. In this situation, allowing all inputs to expand does not much change the average cost of production, and it is called **constant returns to scale**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In this range of the LRAC curve, the average cost of production does not change much as scale rises or falls. The following Clear it Up feature explains where diminishing marginal returns fit into this analysis.\n\n\n\nHow do economies of scale compare to diminishing marginal returns?\n\nThe concept of economies of scale, where average costs decline as production expands, might seem to conflict with the idea of diminishing marginal returns, where marginal costs rise as production expands. But diminishing marginal returns refers only to the short-run average cost curve, where one variable input (like labor) is increasing, but other inputs (like capital) are fixed. Economies of scale refers to the long-run average cost curve where all inputs are being allowed to increase together. Thus, it is quite possible and common to have an industry that has both diminishing marginal returns when only one input is allowed to change, and at the same time has increasing or constant economies of scale when all inputs change together to produce a larger-scale operation.\n\n\n\nFinally, the right-hand portion of the long-run average cost curve, running from output level Q<sub>4</sub> to Q<sub>5</sub>, shows a situation where, as the level of output and the scale rises, average costs rise as well. This situation is called **diseconomies of scale**{: data-type=\"term\"}. A firm or a factory can grow so large that it becomes very difficult to manage, resulting in unnecessarily high costs as many layers of management try to communicate with workers and with each other, and as failures to communicate lead to disruptions in the flow of work and materials. Not many overly large factories exist in the real world, because with their very high production costs, they are unable to compete for long against plants with lower average costs of production. However, in some planned economies, like the economy of the old Soviet Union, plants that were so large as to be grossly inefficient were able to continue operating for a long time because government economic planners protected them from competition and ensured that they would not make losses.\n\nDiseconomies of scale can also be present across an entire firm, not just a large factory. The **leviathan effect**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} can hit firms that become too large to run efficiently, across the entirety of the enterprise. Firms that shrink their operations are often responding to finding itself in the diseconomies region, thus moving back to a lower average cost at a lower output level.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read an article about the complexity of the belief that banks can be \u201ctoo-big-to-fail.\u201d\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### The Size and Number of Firms in an Industry\n\nThe shape of the long-run average cost curve has implications for how many firms will compete in an industry, and whether the firms in an industry have many different sizes, or tend to be the same size. For example, say that one million dishwashers are sold every year at a price of $500 each and the long-run average cost curve for dishwashers is shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_008) (a). In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_008) (a), the lowest point of the LRAC curve occurs at a quantity of 10,000 produced. Thus, the market for dishwashers will consist of 100 different manufacturing plants of this same size. If some firms built a plant that produced 5,000 dishwashers per year or 25,000 dishwashers per year, the average costs of production at such plants would be well above $500, and the firms would not be able to compete.\n\n Low-cost firms will produce at output level R. When the LRAC curve has a clear minimum point, then any firm producing a different quantity will have higher costs. In this case, a firm producing at a quantity of 10,000 will produce at a lower average cost than a firm producing, say, 5,000 or 20,000 units. (b) Low-cost firms will produce between output levels R and S. When the LRAC curve has a flat bottom, then firms producing at any quantity along this flat bottom can compete. In this case, any firm producing a quantity between 5,000 and 20,000 can compete effectively, although firms producing less than 5,000 or more than 20,000 would face higher average costs and be unable to compete.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C07_008 data-title=\"The LRAC Curve and the Size and Number of Firms \"}\n\n\n\nHow can cities be viewed as examples of economies of scale?\n\nWhy are people and economic activity concentrated in cities, rather than distributed evenly across a country? The fundamental reason must be related to the idea of economies of scale\u2014that grouping economic activity is more productive in many cases than spreading it out. For example, cities provide a large group of nearby customers, so that businesses can produce at an efficient economy of scale. They also provide a large group of workers and suppliers, so that business can hire easily and purchase whatever specialized inputs they need. Many of the attractions of cities, like sports stadiums and museums, can operate only if they can draw on a large nearby population base. Cities are big enough to offer a wide variety of products, which is what many shoppers are looking for.\n\nThese factors are not exactly economies of scale in the narrow sense of the production function of a single firm, but they are related to growth in the overall size of population and market in an area. Cities are sometimes called \u201cagglomeration economies.\u201d\n\nThese agglomeration factors help to explain why every economy, as it develops, has an increasing proportion of its population living in urban areas. In the United States, about 80% of the population now lives in metropolitan areas (which include the suburbs around cities), compared to just 40% in 1900. However, in poorer nations of the world, including much of Africa, the proportion of the population in urban areas is only about 30%. One of the great challenges for these countries as their economies grow will be to manage the growth of the great cities that will arise.\n\nIf cities offer economic advantages that are a form of economies of scale, then why don\u2019t all or most people live in one giant city? At some point, agglomeration economies must turn into diseconomies. For example, traffic congestion may reach a point where the gains from being geographically nearby are counterbalanced by how long it takes to travel. High densities of people, cars, and factories can mean more garbage and air and water pollution. Facilities like parks or museums may become overcrowded. There may be economies of scale for negative activities like crime, because high densities of people and businesses, combined with the greater impersonality of cities, make it easier for illegal activities as well as legal ones. The future of cities, both in the United States and in other countries around the world, will be determined by their ability to benefit from the economies of agglomeration and to minimize or counterbalance the corresponding diseconomies.\n\n\n\nA more common case is illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_008) (b), where the LRAC curve has a flat-bottomed area of constant returns to scale. In this situation, any firm with a level of output between 5,000 and 20,000 will be able to produce at about the same level of average cost. Given that the market will demand one million dishwashers per year at a price of $500, this market might have as many as 200 producers (that is, one million dishwashers divided by firms making 5,000 each) or as few as 50 producers (one million dishwashers divided by firms making 20,000 each). The producers in this market will range in size from firms that make 5,000 units to firms that make 20,000 units. But firms that produce below 5,000 units or more than 20,000 will be unable to compete, because their average costs will be too high. Thus, if we see an industry where almost all plants are the same size, it is likely that the long-run average cost curve has a unique bottom point as in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_008) (a). However, if the long-run average cost curve has a wide flat bottom like [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_008) (b), then firms of a variety of different sizes will be able to compete with each other.\n\nThe flat section of the long-run average cost curve in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_008) (b) can be interpreted in two different ways. One interpretation is that a single manufacturing plant producing a quantity of 5,000 has the same average costs as a single manufacturing plant with four times as much capacity that produces a quantity of 20,000. The other interpretation is that one firm owns a single manufacturing plant that produces a quantity of 5,000, while another firm owns four separate manufacturing plants, which each produce a quantity of 5,000. This second explanation, based on the insight that a single firm may own a number of different manufacturing plants, is especially useful in explaining why the long-run average cost curve often has a large flat segment\u2014and thus why a seemingly smaller firm may be able to compete quite well with a larger firm. At some point, however, the task of coordinating and managing many different plants raises the cost of production sharply, and the long-run average cost curve slopes up as a result.\n\nIn the examples to this point, the quantity demanded in the market is quite large (one million) compared with the quantity produced at the bottom of the long-run average cost curve (5,000, 10,000 or 20,000). In such a situation, the market is set for competition between many firms. But what if the bottom of the long-run average cost curve is at a quantity of 10,000 and the total market demand at that price is only slightly higher than that quantity\u2014or even somewhat lower?\n\nReturn to [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_008) (a), where the bottom of the long-run average cost curve is at 10,000, but now imagine that the total quantity of dishwashers demanded in the market at that price of $500 is only 30,000. In this situation, the total number of firms in the market would be three. A handful of firms in a market is called an \u201coligopoly,\u201d and the chapter on [Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly](/m48658){: .target-chapter} will discuss the range of competitive strategies that can occur when oligopolies compete.\n\nAlternatively, consider a situation, again in the setting of [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C07_008) (a), where the bottom of the long-run average cost curve is 10,000, but total demand for the product is only 5,000. (For simplicity, imagine that this demand is highly inelastic, so that it does not vary according to price.) In this situation, the market may well end up with a single firm\u2014a monopoly\u2014producing all 5,000 units. If any firm tried to challenge this monopoly while producing a quantity lower than 5,000 units, the prospective competitor firm would have a higher average cost, and so it would not be able to compete in the longer term without losing money. The chapter on [Monopoly](/m48650){: .target-chapter} discusses the situation of a monopoly firm.\n\nThus, the shape of the long-run average cost curve reveals whether competitors in the market will be different sizes. If the LRAC curve has a single point at the bottom, then the firms in the market will be about the same size, but if the LRAC curve has a flat-bottomed segment of constant returns to scale, then firms in the market may be a variety of different sizes.\n\nThe relationship between the quantity at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve and the quantity demanded in the market at that price will predict how much competition is likely to exist in the market. If the quantity demanded in the market far exceeds the quantity at the minimum of the LRAC, then many firms will compete. If the quantity demanded in the market is only slightly higher than the quantity at the minimum of the LRAC, a few firms will compete. If the quantity demanded in the market is less than the quantity at the minimum of the LRAC, a single-producer monopoly is a likely outcome.\n\n### Shifting Patterns of Long-Run Average Cost\n\nNew developments in production technology can shift the long-run average cost curve in ways that can alter the size distribution of firms in an industry.\n\nFor much of the twentieth century, the most common change has been to see alterations in technology, like the assembly line or the large department store, where large-scale producers seemed to gain an advantage over smaller ones. In the long-run average cost curve, the downward-sloping economies of scale portion of the curve stretched over a larger quantity of output.\n\nHowever, new production technologies do not inevitably lead to a greater average size for firms. For example, in recent years some new technologies for generating electricity on a smaller scale have appeared. The traditional coal-burning electricity plants needed to produce 300 to 600 megawatts of power to exploit economies of scale fully. However, high-efficiency turbines to produce electricity from burning natural gas can produce electricity at a competitive price while producing a smaller quantity of 100 megawatts or less. These new technologies create the possibility for smaller companies or plants to generate electricity as efficiently as large ones. Another example of a technology-driven shift to smaller plants may be taking place in the tire industry. A traditional mid-size tire plant produces about six million tires per year. However, in 2000, the Italian company Pirelli introduced a new tire factory that uses many robots. The Pirelli tire plant produced only about one million tires per year, but did so at a lower average cost than a traditional mid-sized tire plant.\n\nControversy has simmered in recent years over whether the new information and communications technologies will lead to a larger or smaller size for firms. On one side, the new technology may make it easier for small firms to reach out beyond their local geographic area and find customers across a state, or the nation, or even across international boundaries. This factor might seem to predict a future with a larger number of small competitors. On the other side, perhaps the new information and communications technology will create \u201cwinner-take-all\u201d markets where one large company will tend to command a large share of total sales, as Microsoft has done in the production of software for personal computers or Amazon has done in online bookselling. Moreover, improved information and communication technologies might make it easier to manage many different plants and operations across the country or around the world, and thus encourage larger firms. This ongoing battle between the forces of smallness and largeness will be of great interest to economists, businesspeople, and policymakers.\n\n\n\nAmazon\n\nTraditionally, bookstores have operated in retail locations with inventories held either on the shelves or in the back of the store. These retail locations were very pricey in terms of rent. Amazon has no retail locations; it sells online and delivers by mail. Amazon offers almost any book in print, convenient purchasing, and prompt delivery by mail. Amazon holds its inventories in huge warehouses in low-rent locations around the world. The warehouses are highly computerized using robots and relatively low-skilled workers, making for low average costs per sale. Amazon demonstrates the significant advantages economies of scale can offer to a firm that exploits those economies.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA production technology refers to a specific combination of labor, physical capital, and technology that makes up a particular method of production.\n\nIn the long run, firms can choose their production technology, and so all costs become variable costs. In making this choice, firms will try to substitute relatively inexpensive inputs for relatively expensive inputs where possible, so as to produce at the lowest possible long-run average cost.\n\nEconomies of scale refers to a situation where as the level of output increases, the average cost decreases. Constant returns to scale refers to a situation where average cost does not change as output increases. Diseconomies of scale refers to a situation where as output increases, average costs increase also.\n\nThe long-run average cost curve shows the lowest possible average cost of production, allowing all the inputs to production to vary so that the firm is choosing its production technology. A downward-sloping LRAC shows economies of scale; a flat LRAC shows constant returns to scale; an upward-sloping LRAC shows diseconomies of scale. If the long-run average cost curve has only one quantity produced that results in the lowest possible average cost, then all of the firms competing in an industry should be the same size. However, if the LRAC has a flat segment at the bottom, so that a range of different quantities can be produced at the lowest average cost, the firms competing in the industry will display a range of sizes. The market demand in conjunction with the long-run average cost curve determines how many firms will exist in a given industry.\n\nIf the quantity demanded in the market of a certain product is much greater than the quantity found at the bottom of the long-run average cost curve, where the cost of production is lowest, the market will have many firms competing. If the quantity demanded in the market is less than the quantity at the bottom of the LRAC, there will likely be only one firm.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nReturn to the problem explained in [[link]](#Table_07_06) and [[link]](#Table_07_07). If the cost of labor remains at $40, but the cost of a machine decreases to $50, what would be the total cost of each method of production? Which method should the firm use, and why?\n\n\n\nThe new table should look like this:\n\n<table id=\"Table_07_09\" summary=\"For technology 1, labor cost is $400, machine cost is $100, total cost is $500. For technology 2, labor cost is $280, machine cost is $200, total cost is $480.

This makes sense since, with cheaper machine hours, one would expect a shift in the direction of more machines and less labor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose the cost of machines increases to $55, while the cost of labor stays at $40. How would that affect the total cost of the three methods? Which method should the firm choose now?\n\n\n\n<table id=\"Table_07_10\" summary=\"For technology 1, labor cost is $400, machine cost is $110, total cost is $510.

Because the cost of machines increased (relative to the previous question), you would expect a shift toward less capital and more labor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutomobile manufacturing is an industry subject to significant economies of scale. Suppose there are four domestic auto manufacturers, but the demand for domestic autos is no more than 2.5 times the quantity produced at the bottom of the long-run average cost curve. What do you expect will happen to the domestic auto industry in the long run?\n\n\n\nThis is the situation that existed in the United States in the 1970s. Since there is only demand enough for 2.5 firms to reach the bottom of the average cost curve, you would expect one firm will not be around in the long run, and at least one firm will be struggling.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat shapes would you generally expect each of the following cost curves to have: fixed costs, variable costs, marginal costs, average total costs, and average variable costs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a production technology?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn choosing a production technology, how will firms react if one input becomes relatively more expensive?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a long-run average cost curve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between economies of scale, constant returns to scale, and diseconomies of scale?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat shape of a long-run average cost curve illustrates economies of scale, constant returns to scale, and diseconomies of scale?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy will firms in most markets be located at or close to the bottom of the long-run average cost curve?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nIt is clear that businesses operate in the short run, but do they ever operate in the long run? Discuss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would an improvement in technology, like the high-efficiency gas turbines or Pirelli tire plant, affect the long-run average cost curve of a firm? Can you draw the old curve and the new one on the same axes? How might such an improvement affect other firms in the industry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you think that the taxicab industry in large cities would be subject to significant economies of scale? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nA small company that shovels sidewalks and driveways has 100 homes signed up for its services this winter. It can use various combinations of capital and labor: lots of labor with hand shovels, less labor with snow blowers, and still less labor with a pickup truck that has a snowplow on front. To summarize, the method choices are:\n\nMethod 1: 50 units of labor, 10 units of capital\n\nMethod 2: 20 units of labor, 40 units of capital\n\nMethod 3: 10 units of labor, 70 units of capital\n\nIf hiring labor for the winter costs $100/unit and a unit of capital costs $400, what production method should be chosen? What method should be chosen if the cost of labor rises to $200/unit?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nconstant returns to scale\n: expanding all inputs proportionately does not change the average cost of production\n^\n\ndiseconomies of scale\n: the long-run average cost of producing each individual unit increases as total output increases\n^\n\nlong-run average cost (LRAC) curve\n: shows the lowest possible average cost of production, allowing all the inputs to production to vary so that the firm is choosing its production technology\n^\n\nproduction technologies\n: alternative methods of combining inputs to produce output\n^\n\nshort-run average cost (SRAC) curve\n: the average total cost curve in the short term; shows the total of the average fixed costs and the average variable costs\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/Toobig", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

If so, you faced stiff competition from a lot of other competitors who offered identical services. There was nothing to stop others from offering their services too.\n\nAll of you charged the \u201cgoing rate.\u201d If you tried to charge more, your customers would simply buy from someone else. These conditions are very similar to the conditions agricultural growers face.\n\nGrowing a crop may be more difficult to start than a babysitting or lawn mowing service, but growers face the same fierce competition. In the grand scale of world agriculture, farmers face competition from thousands of others because they sell an identical product. After all, winter wheat is winter wheat. But it is relatively easy for farmers to leave the marketplace for another crop. In this case, they do not sell the family farm, they switch crops.\n\nTake the case of the upper Midwest region of the United States\u2014for many generations the area was called \u201cKing Wheat.\u201d According to the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, statistics by state, in 1997, 11.6 million acres of wheat and 780,000 acres of corn were planted in North Dakota. In the intervening 15 or so years has the mix of crops changed? Since it is relatively easy to switch crops, did farmers change what was planted as the relative crop prices changed? We will find out at chapter\u2019s end.\n\nIn the meantime, let\\'s consider the topic of this chapter\u2014the perfectly competitive market. This is a market in which entry and exit are relatively easy and competitors are \u201ca dime a dozen.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Perfect Competition\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Perfect Competition and Why It Matters\n* How Perfectly Competitive Firms Make Output Decisions\n* Entry and Exit Decisions in the Long Run\n* Efficiency in Perfectly Competitive Markets\n\n\n\nAll businesses face two realities: no one is required to buy their products, and even customers who might want those products may buy from other businesses instead. Firms that operate in perfectly competitive markets face this reality. In this chapter, you will learn how such firms make decisions about how much to produce, how much profit they make, whether to stay in business or not, and many others. Industries differ from one another in terms of how many sellers there are in a specific market, how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter, and the type of products that are sold. This is referred to as the **market structure**{: data-type=\"term\"} of the industry. In this chapter, we focus on perfect competition. However, in other chapters we will examine other industry types: [Monopoly](/m48650){: .target-chapter} and [Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly](/m48658){: .target-chapter}.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48646", "module_title": "Economics - m48646", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48646", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Explain the characteristics of a perfectly competitive market\n* Discuss how perfectly competitive firms react in the short run and in the long run\n\n\n\nFirms are said to be in **perfect competition**{: data-type=\"term\"} when the following conditions occur: (1) many firms produce identical products; (2) many buyers are available to buy the product, and many sellers are available to sell the product; (3) sellers and buyers have all relevant information to make rational decisions about the product being bought and sold; and (4) firms can enter and leave the market without any restrictions\u2014in other words, there is free entry and exit into and out of the market.\n\nA **perfectly competitive firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is known as a **price taker**{: data-type=\"term\"}, because the pressure of competing firms forces them to accept the prevailing equilibrium price in the market. If a firm in a perfectly competitive market raises the price of its product by so much as a penny, it will lose all of its sales to competitors. When a wheat grower, as discussed in the Bring it Home feature, wants to know what the going price of wheat is, he or she has to go to the computer or listen to the radio to check. The market price is determined solely by supply and demand in the entire market and not the individual farmer. Also, a perfectly competitive firm must be a very small player in the overall market, so that it can increase or decrease output without noticeably affecting the overall quantity supplied and price in the market.\n\nA perfectly competitive market is a hypothetical extreme; however, producers in a number of industries do face many competitor firms selling highly similar goods, in which case they must often act as price takers. Agricultural markets are often used as an example. The same crops grown by different farmers are largely interchangeable. According to the United States Department of Agriculture monthly reports, in 2015, U.S. corn farmers received an average price of $6.00 per bushel and wheat farmers received an average price of $6.00 per bushel. A corn farmer who attempted to sell at $7.00 per bushel, or a wheat grower who attempted to sell for $8.00 per bushel, would not have found any buyers. A perfectly competitive firm will not sell below the equilibrium price either. Why should they when they can sell all they want at the higher price? Other examples of agricultural markets that operate in close to perfectly competitive markets are small roadside produce markets and small organic farmers.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] that reveals the current value of various commodities.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch08mod01_qr01\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nThis chapter examines how profit-seeking firms decide how much to produce in perfectly competitive markets. Such firms will analyze their costs as discussed in the chapter on [Cost and Industry Structure](/m48620){: .target-chapter}. In the short run, the perfectly competitive firm will seek the quantity of output where profits are highest or, if profits are not possible, where losses are lowest. In this example, the \u201cshort run\u201d refers to a situation in which firms are producing with one fixed input and incur fixed costs of production. (In the real world, firms can have many fixed inputs.)\n\nIn the long run, perfectly competitive firms will react to profits by increasing production. They will respond to losses by reducing production or exiting the market. Ultimately, a long-run *equilibrium* will be attained when no new firms want to enter the market and existing firms do not want to leave the market, as economic profits have been driven down to zero.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch08mod01_summ}\n\nA perfectly competitive firm is a price taker, which means that it must accept the equilibrium price at which it sells goods. If a perfectly competitive firm attempts to charge even a tiny amount more than the market price, it will be unable to make any sales. In a perfectly competitive market there are thousands of sellers, easy entry, and identical products. A short-run production period is when firms are producing with some fixed inputs. Long-run equilibrium in a perfectly competitive industry occurs after all firms have entered and exited the industry and seller profits are driven to zero.\n\nPerfect competition means that there are many sellers, there is easy entry and exiting of firms, products are identical from one seller to another, and sellers are price takers.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch08mod01_sques}\n\n\n\nFirms in a perfectly competitive market are said to be \u201cprice takers\u201d\u2014that is, once the market determines an equilibrium price for the product, firms must accept this price. If you sell a product in a perfectly competitive market, but you are not happy with its price, would you raise the price, even by a cent?\n\n\n\nNo, you would not raise the price. Your product is exactly the same as the product of the many other firms in the market. If your price is greater than that of your competitors, then your customers would switch to them and stop buying from you. You would lose all your sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould independent trucking fit the characteristics of a perfectly competitive industry?\n\n\n\nPossibly. Independent truckers are by definition small and numerous. All that is required to get into the business is a truck (not an inexpensive asset, though) and a commercial driver\u2019s license. To exit, one need only sell the truck. All trucks are essentially the same, providing transportation from point A to point B. (We\u2019re assuming we not talking about specialized trucks.) Independent truckers must take the going rate for their service, so independent trucking does seem to have most of the characteristics of perfect competition.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch08mod01_rques}\n\n\n\nA single firm in a perfectly competitive market is relatively small compared to the rest of the market. What does this mean? How \u201csmall\u201d is \u201csmall\u201d?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the four basic assumptions of perfect competition? Explain in words what they imply for a perfectly competitive firm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a \u201cprice taker\u201d firm?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#ch08mod01_ctques}\n\n\n\nFinding a life partner is a complicated process that may take many years. It is hard to think of this process as being part of a very complex market, with a demand and a supply for partners. Think about how this market works and some of its characteristics, such as search costs. Would you consider it a perfectly competitive market?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you name five examples of perfectly competitive markets? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nmarket structure\n: {: #ch08mod01_gl01m} the conditions in an industry, such as number of sellers, how easy or difficult it is for a new firm to enter, and the type of products that are sold\n{: #ch08mod01_gl01}\n\nperfect competition\n: {: #ch08mod01_gl02m} each firm faces many competitors that sell identical products\n{: #ch08mod01_gl02}\n\nprice taker\n: {: #ch08mod01_gl03m} a firm in a perfectly competitive market that must take the prevailing market price as given\n{: #ch08mod01_gl03}\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/commodities", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

To understand why this is so, consider a different way of writing out the basic definition of **profit**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\\:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"> <mrow> <mtable columnalign=\"left\"> <mtr columnalign=\"left\"> <mtd columnalign=\"left\"> <mrow> <mtext>Profit</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Total\u00a0revenue</mtext><mo>\u2212</mo><mtext>Total\u00a0cost</mtext> </mrow> </mtd> </mtr> <mtr columnalign=\"left\"> <mtd columnalign=\"left\"> <mrow> <mtext>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</mtext><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mtext>Price</mtext><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mtext>Quantity\u00a0produced</mtext><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>\u2212</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mtext>Average\u00a0cost</mtext><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mtext>Quantity\u00a0produced</mtext><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo> </mrow> </mtd> </mtr> </mtable> </mrow> </math>\n\n\n\n\nSince a perfectly competitive firm must accept the price for its output as determined by the product\u2019s market demand and supply, it cannot choose the price it charges. This is already determined in the profit equation, and so the perfectly competitive firm can sell any number of units at exactly the same price. It implies that the firm faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product: buyers are willing to buy any number of units of output from the firm at the market price. When the perfectly competitive firm chooses what quantity to produce, then this quantity\u2014along with the prices prevailing in the market for output and inputs\u2014will determine the firm\u2019s total revenue, total costs, and ultimately, level of profits.\n\n### Determining the Highest Profit by Comparing Total Revenue and Total Cost   {#ch08mod02_01}\n\nA perfectly competitive firm can sell as large a quantity as it wishes, as long as it accepts the prevailing market price. Total revenue is going to increase as the firm sells more, depending on the price of the product and the number of units sold. If you increase the number of units sold at a given price, then total revenue will increase. If the price of the product increases for every unit sold, then total revenue also increases. As an example of how a perfectly competitive firm decides what quantity to produce, consider the case of a small farmer who produces raspberries and sells them frozen for $4 per pack. Sales of one pack of raspberries will bring in $4, two packs will be $8, three packs will be $12, and so on. If, for example, the price of frozen raspberries doubles to $8 per pack, then sales of one pack of raspberries will be $8, two packs will be $16, three packs will be $24, and so on.\n\n**Total revenue**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **total costs**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} for the raspberry farm, broken down into fixed and variable costs, are shown in [\\[link\\]](#ch08mod02_tab01) and also appear in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_001). The horizontal axis shows the quantity of frozen raspberries produced in packs; the vertical axis shows both total revenue and total costs, measured in dollars. The total cost curve intersects with the vertical axis at a value that shows the level of fixed costs, and then slopes upward. All these cost curves follow the same characteristics as the curves covered in the [Cost and Industry Structure](/m48620){: .target-chapter} chapter.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C08_001 data-title=\"Total Cost and Total Revenue at the Raspberry Farm\"}\n\n<table id=\"ch08mod02_tab01\" summary=\"The table shows the total cost and total revenue at the raspberry farm.

At any given quantity, total revenue minus total cost will equal profit. One way to determine the most profitable quantity to produce is to see at what quantity total revenue exceeds total cost by the largest amount. On [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_001), the vertical gap between total revenue and total cost represents either profit (if total revenues are greater that total costs at a certain quantity) or losses (if total costs are greater that total revenues at a certain quantity). In this example, total costs will exceed total revenues at output levels from 0 to 40, and so over this range of output, the firm will be making losses. At output levels from 50 to 80, total revenues exceed total costs, so the firm is earning profits. But then at an output of 90 or 100, total costs again exceed total revenues and the firm is making losses. Total profits appear in the final column of [\\[link\\]](#ch08mod02_tab01). The highest total profits in the table, as in the figure that is based on the table values, occur at an output of 70\u201380, when profits will be $56.\n\nA higher price would mean that total revenue would be higher for every quantity sold. A lower price would mean that total revenue would be lower for every quantity sold. What happens if the price drops low enough so that the total revenue line is completely below the total cost curve; that is, at every level of output, total costs are higher than total revenues? In this instance, the best the firm can do is to suffer losses. But a profit-maximizing firm will prefer the quantity of output where total revenues come closest to total costs and thus where the losses are smallest.\n\n(Later we will see that sometimes it will make sense for the firm to shutdown, rather than stay in operation producing output.)\n\n### Comparing Marginal Revenue and Marginal Costs   {#ch08mod02_02}\n\nFirms often do not have the necessary data they need to draw a complete total cost curve for all levels of production. They cannot be sure of what total costs would look like if they, say, doubled production or cut production in half, because they have not tried it. Instead, firms experiment. They produce a slightly greater or lower quantity and observe how profits are affected. In economic terms, this practical approach to maximizing profits means looking at how changes in production affect marginal revenue and marginal cost.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_002) presents the marginal revenue and marginal cost curves based on the total revenue and total cost in [\\[link\\]](#ch08mod02_tab01). The **marginal revenue**{: data-type=\"term\"} curve shows the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit. As mentioned before, a firm in perfect competition faces a perfectly elastic demand curve for its product\u2014that is, the firm\u2019s demand curve is a horizontal line drawn at the market price level. This also means that the firm\u2019s marginal revenue curve is the same as the firm\u2019s demand curve: Every time a consumer demands one more unit, the firm sells one more unit and revenue goes up by exactly the same amount equal to the market price. In this example, every time a pack of frozen raspberries is sold, the firm\u2019s revenue increases by $4. [\\[link\\]](#ch08mod02_tab02) shows an example of this. This condition only holds for price taking firms in perfect competition where:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"> <mrow> <mtext>marginal\u00a0revenue\u00a0=\u00a0price</mtext> </mrow> </math>\n\n\nThe formula for marginal revenue is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow> <mtext>marginal\u00a0revenue\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext><mfrac> <mrow> <mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0total\u00a0revenue</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>\n\n\n| Price | Quantity | Total Revenue | Marginal Revenue |\n|----------\n| $4 | 1 | $4 | - |\n| $4 | 2 | $8 | $4 |\n| $4 | 3 | $12 | $4 |\n| $4 | 4 | $16 | $4 |\n{: #ch08mod02_tab02 summary=\"Column 1 shows the price (P); column 2 shows the quantity (Q); column 3 shows the total revenue (TR); column 4 shows marginal revenue (MR).

Row 4: P = $4, Q = 4, TR =  6, MR = $4.\"}\n\nNotice that marginal revenue does not change as the firm produces more output. That is because the price is determined by supply and demand and does not change as the farmer produces more (keeping in mind that, due to the relative small size of each firm, increasing their supply has no impact on the total market supply where price is determined).\n\nSince a perfectly competitive firm is a price taker, it can sell whatever quantity it wishes at the market-determined price. Marginal cost, the cost per additional unit sold, is calculated by dividing the change in total cost by the change in quantity. The formula for marginal cost is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow> <mtext>marginal\u00a0cost\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext><mfrac> <mrow> <mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0total\u00a0cost</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>\n\n\nOrdinarily, marginal cost changes as the firm produces a greater quantity.\n\nIn the raspberry farm example, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_002), [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_015) and [\\[link\\]](#ch08mod02_tab03), marginal cost at first declines as production increases from 10 to 20 to 30 packs of raspberries\u2014which represents the area of increasing marginal returns that is not uncommon at low levels of production. But then marginal costs start to increase, displaying the typical pattern of diminishing marginal returns. If the firm is producing at a quantity where MR &gt; MC, like 40 or 50 packs of raspberries, then it can increase profit by increasing output because the marginal revenue is exceeding the marginal cost. If the firm is producing at a quantity where MC &gt; MR, like 90 or 100 packs, then it can increase profit by reducing output because the reductions in marginal cost will exceed the reductions in marginal revenue. The firm\u2019s profit-maximizing choice of output will occur where MR = MC (or at a choice close to that point). You will notice that what occurs on the production side is exemplified on the cost side. This is referred to as duality.\n\n curve is a horizontal straight line because it is equal to the price of the good, which is determined by the market, shown in [link]. The marginal cost (MC) curve is sometimes first downward-sloping, if there is a region of increasing marginal returns at low levels of output, but is eventually upward-sloping at higher levels of output as diminishing marginal returns kick in.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C08_002 data-title=\"Marginal Revenues and Marginal Costs at the Raspberry Farm: Individual Farmer\"}\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C08_015 data-title=\"Marginal Revenues and Marginal Costs at the Raspberry Farm: Raspberry Market\"}\n\n<table id=\"ch08mod02_tab03\" summary=\"The table shows the marginal revenues and marginal costs at the raspberry farm.

If the farmer started out producing at a level of 60, and then experimented with increasing production to 70, marginal revenues from the increase in production would exceed marginal costs\u2014and so profits would rise. The farmer has an incentive to keep producing. From a level of 70 to 80, marginal cost and marginal revenue are equal so profit doesn\u2019t change. If the farmer then experimented further with increasing production from 80 to 90, he would find that marginal costs from the increase in production are greater than marginal revenues, and so profits would decline.\n\nThe profit-maximizing choice for a perfectly competitive firm will occur where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost\u2014that is, where MR = MC. A profit-seeking firm should keep expanding production as long as MR &gt; MC. But at the level of output where MR = MC, the firm should recognize that it has achieved the highest possible level of economic profits. (In the example above, the profit maximizing output level is between 70 and 80 units of output, but the firm will not know they\u2019ve maximized profit until they reach 80, where MR = MC.) Expanding production into the zone where MR &lt; MC will only reduce economic profits. Because the marginal revenue received by a perfectly competitive firm is equal to the price P, so that P = MR, the profit-maximizing rule for a perfectly competitive firm can also be written as a recommendation to produce at the quantity where P = MC.\n\n### Profits and Losses with the Average Cost Curve   {#ch08mod02_03}\n\nDoes maximizing profit (producing where MR = MC) imply an actual economic profit? The answer depends on the relationship between price and average total cost. If the price that a firm charges is higher than its average cost of production for that quantity produced, then the firm will earn profits. Conversely, if the price that a firm charges is lower than its average cost of production, the firm will suffer losses. You might think that, in this situation, the farmer may want to shut down immediately. Remember, however, that the firm has already paid for fixed costs, such as equipment, so it may continue to produce and incur a loss. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_014) illustrates three situations: (a) where price intersects marginal cost at a level above the average cost curve, (b) where price intersects marginal cost at a level equal to the average cost curve, and (c) where price intersects marginal cost at a level below the average cost curve.\n\n , price intersects marginal cost above the average cost curve. Since price is greater than average cost, the firm is making a profit. In (b), price intersects marginal cost at the minimum point of the average cost curve. Since price is equal to average cost, the firm is breaking even. In (c), price intersects marginal cost below the average cost curve. Since price is less than average cost, the firm is making a loss.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C08_014 data-title=\"Price and Average Cost at the Raspberry Farm\"}\n\nFirst consider a situation where the price is equal to $5 for a pack of frozen raspberries. The rule for a profit-maximizing perfectly competitive firm is to produce the level of output where Price= MR = MC, so the raspberry farmer will produce a quantity of 90, which is labeled as e in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_014) (a). Remember that the area of a rectangle is equal to its base multiplied by its height. The farm\u2019s total revenue at this price will be shown by the large shaded rectangle from the origin over to a quantity of 90 packs (the base) up to point E\\' (the height), over to the price of $5, and back to the origin.

The answer is that shutting down can reduce variable costs to zero, but in the short run, the firm has already paid for fixed costs. As a result, if the firm produces a quantity of zero, it would still make losses because it would still need to pay for its fixed costs. So, when a firm is experiencing losses, it must face a question: should it continue producing or should it shut down?\n\nAs an example, consider the situation of the Yoga Center, which has signed a contract to rent space that costs $10,000 per month. If the firm decides to operate, its marginal costs for hiring yoga teachers is $15,000 for the month. If the firm shuts down, it must still pay the rent, but it would not need to hire labor. [\\[link\\]](#ch08mod02_tab05) shows three possible scenarios. In the first scenario, the Yoga Center does not have any clients, and therefore does not make any revenues, in which case it faces losses of $10,000 equal to the fixed costs. In the second scenario, the Yoga Center has clients that earn the center revenues of $10,000 for the month, but ultimately experiences losses of $15,000 due to having to hire yoga instructors to cover the classes. In the third scenario, the Yoga Center earns revenues of $20,000 for the month, but experiences losses of $5,000.\n\nIn all three cases, the Yoga Center loses money. In all three cases, when the rental contract expires in the long run, assuming revenues do not improve, the firm should exit this business. In the short run, though, the decision varies depending on the level of losses and whether the firm can cover its variable costs. In scenario 1, the center does not have any revenues, so hiring yoga teachers would increase variable costs and losses, so it should shut down and only incur its fixed costs. In scenario 2, the center\u2019s losses are greater because it does not make enough revenue to offset the increased variable costs plus fixed costs, so it should shut down immediately. If price is below the minimum average variable cost, the firm must shut down. In contrast, in scenario 3 the revenue that the center can earn is high enough that the losses diminish when it remains open, so the center should remain open in the short run.\n\n<table id=\"ch08mod02_tab05\" summary=\"The table shows three scenarios for determining whether a yoga center should shut down now or later.

Let\u2019s return now to our raspberry farm. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_012) illustrates this lesson by adding the average variable cost curve to the marginal cost and average cost curves. At a price of $2.20 per pack, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_012) (a), the farm produces at a level of 50. It is making losses of $56 (as explained earlier), but price is above average variable cost and so the firm continues to operate. However, if the price declined to $1.80 per pack, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_012) (b), and if the firm applied its rule of producing where P = MR = MC, it would produce a quantity of 40. This price is below average variable cost for this level of output. If the farmer cannot pay workers (the variable costs), then it has to shut down. At this price and output, total revenues would be $72 (quantity of 40 times price of $1.80) and total cost would be $144, for overall losses of $72. If the farm shuts down, it must pay only its fixed costs of $62, so shutting down is preferable to selling at a price of $1.80 per pack.\n\n , the farm produces at a level of 50.

If the perfectly competitive firm can charge a price above the shutdown point, then the firm is at least covering its average variable costs. It is also making enough revenue to cover at least a portion of fixed costs, so it should limp ahead even if it is making losses in the short run, since at least those losses will be smaller than if the firm shuts down immediately and incurs a loss equal to total fixed costs. However, if the firm is receiving a price below the price at the shutdown point, then the firm is not even covering its variable costs. In this case, staying open is making the firm\u2019s losses larger, and it should shut down immediately. To summarize, if:\n\n* price &lt; minimum average variable cost, then firm shuts down\n* price = minimum average variable cost, then firm stays in business\n\n### Short-Run Outcomes for Perfectly Competitive Firms   {#ch08mod02_05}\n\nThe average cost and average variable cost curves divide the marginal cost curve into three segments, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_008). At the market price, which the perfectly competitive firm accepts as given, the profit-maximizing firm chooses the output level where price or marginal revenue, which are the same thing for a perfectly competitive firm, is equal to marginal cost: P = MR = MC.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C08_008 data-title=\"Profit, Loss, Shutdown\"}\n\nFirst consider the upper zone, where prices are above the level where marginal cost (MC) crosses average cost (AC) at the zero profit point. At any price above that level, the firm will earn profits in the short run. If the price falls exactly on the zero profit point where the MC and AC curves cross, then the firm earns zero profits. If a price falls into the zone between the zero profit point, where MC crosses AC, and the shutdown point, where MC crosses AVC, the firm will be making losses in the short run\u2014but since the firm is more than covering its variable costs, the losses are smaller than if the firm shut down immediately. Finally, consider a price at or below the shutdown point where MC crosses AVC. At any price like this one, the firm will shut down immediately, because it cannot even cover its variable costs.\n\n### Marginal Cost and the Firm\u2019s Supply Curve   {#ch08mod02_06}\n\nFor a perfectly competitive firm, the marginal cost curve is identical to the firm\u2019s supply curve starting from the minimum point on the average variable cost curve. To understand why this perhaps surprising insight holds true, first think about what the supply curve means. A firm checks the market price and then looks at its supply curve to decide what quantity to produce. Now, think about what it means to say that a firm will maximize its profits by producing at the quantity where P = MC. This rule means that the firm checks the market price, and then looks at its marginal cost to determine the quantity to produce\u2014and makes sure that the price is greater than the minimum average variable cost. In other words, the marginal cost curve above the minimum point on the average variable cost curve becomes the firm\u2019s supply curve.\n\n\nWatch this [video][1] that addresses how drought in the United States can impact food prices across the world. (Note that the story on the drought is the second one in the news report; you need to let the video play through the first story in order to watch the story on the drought.)\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch08mod02_qr01\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nAs discussed in the chapter on [Demand and Supply](/m48628){: .target-chapter}, many of the reasons that supply curves shift relate to underlying changes in costs. For example, a lower price of key inputs or new technologies that reduce production costs cause supply to shift to the right; in contrast, bad weather or added government regulations can add to costs of certain goods in a way that causes supply to shift to the left. These shifts in the firm\u2019s supply curve can also be interpreted as shifts of the marginal cost curve. A shift in costs of production that increases marginal costs at all levels of output\u2014and shifts MC to the left\u2014will cause a perfectly competitive firm to produce less at any given market price. Conversely, a shift in costs of production that decreases marginal costs at all levels of output will shift MC to the right and as a result, a competitive firm will choose to expand its level of output at any given price. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through an example.\n\n\n\nAt What Price Should the Firm Continue Producing in the Short Run?\n\nTo determine the short-run economic condition of a firm in perfect competition, follow the steps outlined below.

Once you have determined the profit-maximizing output level (in this case, output quantity 5), you can look at the amount of profits made (in this case, $40).\n\nStep 6. If the firm is making economic losses, the firm needs to determine whether it produces the output level where price equals marginal revenue and equals marginal cost or it shuts down and only incurs its fixed costs.\n\nStep 7. For the output level where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost, check if the market price is greater than the average variable cost of producing that output level.\n\n* If P &gt; AVC but P &lt; ATC, then the firm continues to produce in the short-run, making economic losses.\n* If P &lt; AVC, then the firm stops producing and only incurs its fixed costs.\n\nIn this example, the price of $28 is greater than the AVC ($16.40) of producing 5 units of output, so the firm continues producing.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch08mod02_summ}\n\nAs a perfectly competitive firm produces a greater quantity of output, its total revenue steadily increases at a constant rate determined by the given market price. Profits will be highest (or losses will be smallest) at the quantity of output where total revenues exceed total costs by the greatest amount (or where total revenues fall short of total costs by the smallest amount). Alternatively, profits will be highest where marginal revenue, which is price for a perfectly competitive firm, is equal to marginal cost. If the market price faced by a perfectly competitive firm is above average cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm is making profits. If the market price is below average cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm is making losses.\n\nIf the market price is equal to average cost at the profit-maximizing level of output, then the firm is making zero profits. The point where the marginal cost curve crosses the average cost curve, at the minimum of the average cost curve, is called the \u201czero profit point.\u201d If the market price faced by a perfectly competitive firm is below average variable cost at the profit-maximizing quantity of output, then the firm should shut down operations immediately. If the market price faced by a perfectly competitive firm is above average variable cost, but below average cost, then the firm should continue producing in the short run, but exit in the long run. The point where the marginal cost curve crosses the average variable cost curve is called the shutdown point.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch08mod02_sques}\n\n\n\nLook at [[link]](#ch08mod02_tab12).

It varies according to the specific business. The distinction between the short run and the long run is therefore more technical: in the short run, firms cannot change the usage of fixed inputs, while in the long run, the firm can adjust all factors of production.\n\nIn a competitive market, profits are a red cape that incites businesses to charge. If a business is making a profit in the short run, it has an incentive to expand existing factories or to build new ones. New firms may start production, as well. When new firms enter the industry in response to increased industry profits it is called **entry**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nLosses are the black thundercloud that causes businesses to flee. If a business is making losses in the short run, it will either keep limping along or just shut down, depending on whether its revenues are covering its variable costs. But in the long run, firms that are facing losses will shut down at least some of their output, and some firms will cease production altogether. The long-run process of reducing production in response to a sustained pattern of losses is called **exit**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The following Clear It Up feature discusses where some of these losses might come from, and the reasons why some firms go out of business.\n\n\n\nWhy do firms cease to exist?\n\nCan we say anything about what causes a firm to exit an industry? Profits are the measurement that determines whether a business stays operating or not. Individuals start businesses with the purpose of making profits. They invest their money, time, effort, and many other resources to produce and sell something that they hope will give them something in return. Unfortunately, not all businesses are successful, and many new startups soon realize that their \u201cbusiness adventure\u201d must eventually end.\n\nIn the model of perfectly competitive firms, those that consistently cannot make money will \u201cexit,\u201d which is a nice, bloodless word for a more painful process. When a business fails, after all, workers lose their jobs, investors lose their money, and owners and managers can lose their dreams. Many businesses fail. The U.S. Small Business Administration indicates that in 2011, 409,040 new firms \\\"entered,\\\" and 470,376 firms failed.\n\nSometimes a business fails because of poor management or workers who are not very productive, or because of tough domestic or foreign competition. Businesses also fail from a variety of causes that might best be summarized as bad luck. For example, conditions of demand and supply in the market shift in an unexpected way, so that the prices that can be charged for outputs fall or the prices that need to be paid for inputs rise. With millions of businesses in the U.S. economy, even a small fraction of them failing will affect many people\u2014and business failures can be very hard on the workers and managers directly involved. But from the standpoint of the overall economic system, business exits are sometimes a necessary evil if a market-oriented system is going to offer a flexible mechanism for satisfying customers, keeping costs low, and inventing new products.\n\n\n\n### How Entry and Exit Lead to Zero Profits in the Long Run   {#ch08mod03_01}\n\nNo **perfectly competitive firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} acting alone can affect the market price. However, the combination of many firms entering or exiting the market will affect overall supply in the market. In turn, a shift in supply for the market as a whole will affect the market price. Entry and exit to and from the market are the driving forces behind a process that, in the long run, pushes the price down to minimum average total costs so that all firms are earning a zero profit.\n\nTo understand how short-run profits for a perfectly competitive firm will evaporate in the long run, imagine the following situation. The market is in **long-run equilibrium**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where all firms earn zero economic profits producing the output level where P = MR = MC and P = AC. No firm has the incentive to enter or leave the market. Let\u2019s say that the product\u2019s demand increases, and with that, the market price goes up. The existing firms in the industry are now facing a higher price than before, so they will increase production to the new output level where P = MR = MC.\n\nThis will temporarily make the market price rise above the average cost curve, and therefore, the existing firms in the market will now be earning economic profits. However, these economic profits attract other firms to enter the market. Entry of many new firms causes the market supply curve to shift to the right. As the supply curve shifts to the right, the market price starts decreasing, and with that, economic profits fall for new and existing firms. As long as there are still profits in the market, entry will continue to shift supply to the right. This will stop whenever the market price is driven down to the zero-profit level, where no firm is earning economic profits.\n\nShort-run losses will fade away by reversing this process. Say that the market is in long-run equilibrium. This time, instead, demand decreases, and with that, the market price starts falling. The existing firms in the industry are now facing a lower price than before, and as it will be below the average cost curve, they will now be making economic losses. Some firms will continue producing where the new P = MR = MC, as long as they are able to cover their average variable costs. Some firms will have to shut down immediately as they will not be able to cover their average variable costs, and will then only incur their fixed costs, minimizing their losses. Exit of many firms causes the market supply curve to shift to the left. As the supply curve shifts to the left, the market price starts rising, and economic losses start to be lower. This process ends whenever the market price rises to the zero-profit level, where the existing firms are no longer losing money and are at zero profits again. Thus, while a perfectly competitive firm can earn profits in the short run, in the long run the process of entry will push down prices until they reach the zero-profit level. Conversely, while a perfectly competitive firm may earn losses in the short run, firms will not continually lose money. In the long run, firms making losses are able to escape from their fixed costs, and their exit from the market will push the price back up to the zero-profit level. In the long run, this process of entry and exit will drive the price in perfectly competitive markets to the zero-profit point at the bottom of the AC curve, where marginal cost crosses average cost.\n\n### The Long-Run Adjustment and Industry Types   {#ch08mod03_02}\n\nWhenever there are expansions in an industry, costs of production for the existing and new firms could either stay the same, increase, or even decrease. Therefore, we can categorize an industry as being (1) a constant cost industry (as demand increases, the cost of production for firms stays the same), (2) an increasing cost industry (as demand increases, the cost of production for firms increases), or (3) a decreasing cost industry (as demand increases the costs of production for the firms decreases).\n\nFor a **constant cost industry**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, whenever there is an increase in market demand and price, then the supply curve shifts to the right with new firms\u2019 entry and stops at the point where the new long-run equilibrium intersects at the same market price as before. But why will costs remain the same? In this type of industry, the supply curve is very elastic. Firms can easily supply any quantity that consumers demand. In addition, there is a perfectly elastic supply of inputs\u2014firms can easily increase their demand for employees, for example, with no increase to wages. Tying in to our Bring it Home discussion, an increased demand for ethanol in recent years has caused the demand for corn to increase. Consequently, many farmers switched from growing wheat to growing corn. Agricultural markets are generally good examples of constant cost industries.\n\nFor an **increasing cost industry**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, as the market expands, the old and new firms experience increases in their costs of production, which makes the new zero-profit level intersect at a higher price than before. Here companies may have to deal with limited inputs, such as skilled labor. As the demand for these workers rise, wages rise and this increases the cost of production for all firms. The industry supply curve in this type of industry is more inelastic.\n\nFor a **decreasing cost industry**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, as the market expands, the old and new firms experience lower costs of production, which makes the new zero-profit level intersect at a lower price than before. In this case, the industry and all the firms in it are experiencing falling average total costs. This can be due to an improvement in technology in the entire industry or an increase in the education of employees. High tech industries may be a good example of a decreasing cost market.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_013) (a) presents the case of an adjustment process in a constant cost industry. Whenever there are output expansions in this type of industry, the long-run outcome implies more output produced at exactly the same original price. Note that supply was able to increase to meet the increased demand. When we join the before and after long-run equilibriums, the resulting line is the long run supply (LRS) curve in perfectly competitive markets. In this case, it is a flat curve. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_013) (b) and [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C08_013) (c) present the cases for an increasing cost and decreasing cost industry, respectively. For an increasing cost industry, the LRS is upward sloping, while for a decreasing cost industry, the LRS is downward sloping.\n\n, demand increased and supply met it. Notice that the supply increase is equal to the demand increase. The result is that the equilibrium price stays the same as quantity sold increases. In (b), notice that sellers were not able to increase supply as much as demand. Some inputs were scarce, or wages were rising. The equilibrium price rises. In (c), sellers easily increased supply in response to the demand increase. Here, new technology or economies of scale caused the large increase in supply, resulting in declining equilibrium price.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C08_013 data-title=\"Adjustment Process in a Constant-Cost Industry\"}\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch08mod03_summ}\n\nIn the long run, firms will respond to profits through a process of entry, where existing firms expand output and new firms enter the market. Conversely, firms will react to losses in the long run through a process of exit, in which existing firms reduce output or cease production altogether. Through the process of entry in response to profits and exit in response to losses, the price level in a perfectly competitive market will move toward the zero-profit point, where the marginal cost curve crosses the AC curve, at the minimum of the average cost curve.\n\nThe long-run supply curve shows the long-run output supplied by firms in three different types of industries: constant cost, increasing cost, and decreasing cost.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch08mod03_sques}\n\n\n\nIf new technology in a perfectly competitive market brings about a substantial reduction in costs of production, how will this affect the market?\n\n\n\nWith a technological improvement that brings about a reduction in costs of production, an adjustment process will take place in the market. The technological improvement will result in an increase in supply curves, by individual firms and at the market level. The existing firms will experience higher profits for a while, which will attract other firms into the market. This entry process will stop whenever the market supply increases enough (both by existing and new firms) so profits are driven back to zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA market in perfect competition is in long-run equilibrium. What happens to the market if labor unions are able to increase wages for workers?\n\n\n\nWhen wages increase, costs of production increase. Some firms would now be making economic losses and would shut down. The supply curve then starts shifting to the left, pushing the market price up. This process ends when all firms remaining in the market earn zero economic profits. The result is a contraction in the output produced in the market.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch08mod03_rques}\n\n\n\nWhy does entry occur?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does exit occur?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo entry and exit occur in the short run, the long run, both, or neither?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat price will a perfectly competitive firm end up charging in the long run?

{"module_id": "m48649", "module_title": "Economics - m48649", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48649", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Apply concepts of productive efficiency and allocative efficiency to perfectly competitive markets\n* Compare the model of perfect competition to real-world markets\n\n\n\nWhen profit-maximizing firms in perfectly competitive markets combine with utility-maximizing consumers, something remarkable happens: the resulting quantities of outputs of goods and services demonstrate both productive and allocative efficiency (terms that were first introduced in ([Choice in a World of Scarcity](/m48602){: .target-chapter}) .\n\n**Productive efficiency**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} means producing without waste, so that the choice is on the production possibility frontier. In the long run in a perfectly competitive market, because of the process of entry and exit, the price in the market is equal to the minimum of the long-run average cost curve. In other words, goods are being produced and sold at the lowest possible average cost.\n\nAllocative efficiency means that among the points on the production possibility frontier, the point that is chosen is socially preferred\u2014at least in a particular and specific sense. In a perfectly competitive market, price will be equal to the marginal cost of production. Think about the price that is paid for a good as a measure of the social benefit received for that good; after all, willingness to pay conveys what the good is worth to a buyer. Then think about the marginal cost of producing the good as representing not just the cost for the firm, but more broadly as the social cost of producing that good. When perfectly competitive firms follow the rule that profits are maximized by producing at the quantity where price is equal to marginal cost, they are thus ensuring that the social benefits received from producing a good are in line with the social costs of production.\n\nTo explore what is meant by **allocative efficiency**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, it is useful to walk through an example. Begin by assuming that the market for wholesale flowers is perfectly competitive, and so P = MC. Now, consider what it would mean if firms in that market produced a lesser quantity of flowers. At a lesser quantity, marginal costs will not yet have increased as much, so that price will exceed marginal cost; that is, P &gt; MC. In that situation, the benefit to society as a whole of producing additional goods, as measured by the willingness of consumers to pay for marginal units of a good, would be higher than the cost of the inputs of labor and physical capital needed to produce the marginal good. In other words, the gains to society as a whole from producing additional marginal units will be greater than the costs.\n\nConversely, consider what it would mean if, compared to the level of output at the allocatively efficient choice when P = MC, firms produced a greater quantity of flowers. At a greater quantity, marginal costs of production will have increased so that P &lt; MC. In that case, the marginal costs of producing additional flowers is greater than the benefit to society as measured by what people are willing to pay. For society as a whole, since the costs are outstripping the benefits, it will make sense to produce a lower quantity of such goods.\n\nWhen perfectly competitive firms maximize their profits by producing the quantity where P = MC, they also assure that the benefits to consumers of what they are buying, as measured by the price they are willing to pay, is equal to the costs to society of producing the marginal units, as measured by the marginal costs the firm must pay\u2014and thus that allocative efficiency holds.\n\nThe statements that a perfectly competitive market in the long run will feature both productive and allocative efficiency do need to be taken with a few grains of salt. Remember, economists are using the concept of \u201cefficiency\u201d in a particular and specific sense, not as a synonym for \u201cdesirable in every way.\u201d For one thing, consumers\u2019 ability to pay reflects the income distribution in a particular society. Thus, a homeless person may have no ability to pay for housing because they have insufficient income.\n\nPerfect competition, in the long run, is a hypothetical benchmark. For market structures such as monopoly, monopolistic competition, and oligopoly, which are more frequently observed in the real world than perfect competition, firms will not always produce at the minimum of average cost, nor will they always set price equal to marginal cost. Thus, these other competitive situations will not produce productive and allocative efficiency.\n\nMoreover, real-world markets include many issues that are assumed away in the model of perfect competition, including pollution, inventions of new technology, poverty which may make some people unable to pay for basic necessities of life, government programs like national defense or education, discrimination in labor markets, and buyers and sellers who must deal with imperfect and unclear information. These issues are explored in other chapters. However, the theoretical efficiency of perfect competition does provide a useful benchmark for comparing the issues that arise from these real-world problems.\n\n\n\nA Dime a Dozen\n\nA quick glance at [\\[link\\]](#ch08mod04_tab01) reveals the dramatic increase in North Dakota corn production\u2014more than double. Taking into consideration that corn typically yields two to three times as many bushels per acre as wheat, it is obvious there has been a significant increase in bushels of corn. Why the increase in corn acreage? Converging prices.\n\n<table id=\"ch08mod04_tab01\" summary=\"This table has three columns and one row. The first row is a header row and it labels each column, 'Year,' 'Corn (millions of acres),' and 'Wheat (millions of acres).' Under the &#x201C;Year&#x201D; column is the value: 2014. Under the 'Corn (millions of acres)' column is the value: 91.6.

However, in recent years wheat and corn prices have been converging. In April 2013, *Agweek* reported the gap was just 71 cents per bushel. As the difference in price narrowed, switching to the production of higher yield per acre of corn simply made good business sense. Erik Younggren, president of the National Association of Wheat Growers said in the *Agweek* article, \u201cI don\\'t think we\\'re going to see mile after mile of waving amber fields \\[of wheat\\] anymore.\\\" (Until wheat prices rise, we will probably be seeing field after field of tasseled corn.)\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch08mod04_summ}\n\nLong-run equilibrium in perfectly competitive markets meets two important conditions: allocative efficiency and productive efficiency. These two conditions have important implications. First, resources are allocated to their best alternative use. Second, they provide the maximum satisfaction attainable by society.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch08mod04_sques}\n\n\n\nProductive efficiency and allocative efficiency are two concepts achieved in the long run in a perfectly competitive market. These are the two reasons why we call them \u201cperfect.\u201d How would you use these two concepts to analyze other market structures and label them \u201cimperfect?\u201d\n\n\n\nPerfect competition is considered to be \u201cperfect\u201d because both allocative and productive efficiency are met at the same time in a long-run equilibrium. If a market structure results in long-run equilibrium that does not minimize average total costs and/or does not charge a price equal to marginal cost, then either allocative or productive (or both) efficiencies are not met, and therefore the market cannot be labeled \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain how the profit-maximizing rule of setting P = MC leads a perfectly competitive market to be allocatively efficient.\n\n\n\nThink of the market price as representing the gain to society from a purchase, since it represents what someone is willing to pay. Think of the marginal cost as representing the cost to society from making the last unit of a good. If P &gt; MC, then the benefits from producing more of a good exceed the costs, and society would gain from producing more of the good. If P &lt; MC, then the social costs of producing the marginal good exceed the social benefits, and society should produce less of the good. Only if P = MC, the rule applied by a profit-maximizing perfectly competitive firm, will society\u2019s costs and benefits be in balance. This choice will be the option that brings the greatest overall benefit to society.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch08mod04_rques}\n\n\n\nWill a perfectly competitive market display productive efficiency? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill a perfectly competitive market display allocative efficiency? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#ch08mod04_ctques}\n\n\n\nAssuming that the market for cigarettes is in perfect competition, what does allocative and productive efficiency imply in this case? What does it not imply?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the argument for why perfect competition is allocatively efficient, the price that people are willing to pay represents the gains to society and the marginal cost to the firm represents the costs to society. Can you think of some social costs or issues that are not included in the marginal cost to the firm? Or some social gains that are not included in what people pay for a good?\n\n\n\n\n### References   {#ch08mod04_ref}\n\nIndex Mundi. n.d. \u201cWheat Monthly Price\u2014U.S. Dollars per Metric Ton.\u201d Accessed March 11, 2015. http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=wheat.\n\nKnutson, J. \u201cWheat on the Defensive in the Northern Plains.\u201d *Agweek, Associated Press State Wire: North Dakota (ND)*.

This one steps into the past to observe how monopoly, or near monopolies, have helped shape history. In the spring of 1773, the East India Company, a firm that, in its time, was designated \u2018too big to fail,\u2019 was continuing to experience financial difficulties. To help shore up the failing firm, the British Parliament authorized the Tea Act. The act continued the tax on teas and made the East India Company the sole legal supplier of tea to the American colonies. By November, the citizens of Boston had had enough. They refused to permit the tea to be unloaded, citing their main complaint: \u201cNo taxation without representation.\u201d Arriving tea-bearing ships were warned via several newspapers, including *The Massachusetts Gazette*, \u201cWe are prepared, and shall not fail to pay them an unwelcome visit; by The Mohawks.\u201d\n\nStep forward in time to 1860\u2014the eve of the American Civil War\u2014to another near monopoly supplier of historical significance: the U.S. cotton industry. At that time, the Southern states provided the majority of the cotton Britain imported. The South, wanting to secede from the Union, hoped to leverage Britain\u2019s high dependency on its cotton into formal diplomatic recognition of the Confederate States of America.\n\nThis leads us to the topic of this chapter: a firm that controls all (or nearly all) of the supply of a good or service\u2014a monopoly. How do monopoly firms behave in the marketplace? Do they have \u201cpower?\u201d Does this power potentially have unintended consequences? We\u2019ll return to this case at the end of the chapter to see how the tea and cotton monopolies influenced U.S. history.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to a Monopoly\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* How Monopolies form: Barriers to Entry\n* How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Chooses Output and Price\n\n\n\nThere is a widespread belief that top executives at firms are the strongest supporters of market competition, but this belief is far from the truth. Think about it this way: If you very much wanted to win an Olympic gold medal, would you rather be far better than everyone else, or locked in competition with many athletes just as good as you are? Similarly, if you would like to attain a very high level of profits, would you rather manage a business with little or no competition, or struggle against many tough competitors who are trying to sell to your customers? By now, you might have read the chapter on [Perfect Competition](/m48645){: .target-chapter}. In this chapter, we explore the opposite extreme: monopoly.\n\nIf perfect competition is a market where firms have no market power and they simply respond to the market price, monopoly is a market with no competition at all, and firms have complete market power. In the case of **monopoly**{: data-type=\"term\"}, one firm produces all of the output in a market. Since a monopoly faces no significant competition, it can charge any price it wishes. While a monopoly, by definition, refers to a single firm, in practice the term is often used to describe a market in which one firm merely has a very high market share. This tends to be the definition that the U.S. Department of Justice uses.\n\nEven though there are very few true monopolies in existence, we do deal with some of those few every day, often without realizing it: The U.S. Postal Service, your electric and garbage collection companies are a few examples. Some new drugs are produced by only one pharmaceutical firm\u2014and no close substitutes for that drug may exist.\n\nFrom the mid-1990s until 2004, the U.S. Department of Justice prosecuted the Microsoft Corporation for including Internet Explorer as the default web browser with its operating system. The Justice Department\u2019s argument was that, since Microsoft possessed an extremely high market share in the industry for operating systems, the inclusion of a free web browser constituted unfair competition to other browsers, such as Netscape Navigator. Since nearly everyone was using Windows, including Internet Explorer eliminated the incentive for consumers to explore other browsers and made it impossible for competitors to gain a foothold in the market. In 2013, the Windows system ran on more than 90% of the most commonly sold personal computers. In 2015, a U.S. federal court tossed out antitrust charges that Google had an agreement with mobile device makers to set Google as the default search engine.\n\nThis chapter begins by describing how monopolies are protected from competition, including laws that prohibit competition, technological advantages, and certain configurations of demand and supply. It then discusses how a monopoly will choose its profit-maximizing quantity to produce and what price to charge. While a monopoly must be concerned about whether consumers will purchase its products or spend their money on something altogether different, the monopolist need not worry about the actions of other competing firms producing its products. As a result, a monopoly is not a price taker like a perfectly competitive firm, but instead exercises some power to choose its market price.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48651", "module_title": "Economics - m48651", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48651", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Distinguish between a natural monopoly and a legal monopoly.\n* Explain how economies of scale and the control of natural resources led to the necessary formation of legal monopolies\n* Analyze the importance of trademarks and patents in promoting innovation\n* Identify examples of predatory pricing\n\n\n\nBecause of the lack of competition, monopolies tend to earn significant economic profits. These profits should attract vigorous competition as described in [Perfect Competition](/m48645), and yet, because of one particular characteristic of monopoly, they do not. **Barriers to entry**{: data-type=\"term\"} are the legal, technological, or market forces that discourage or prevent potential competitors from entering a market. Barriers to entry can range from the simple and easily surmountable, such as the cost of renting retail space, to the extremely restrictive. For example, there are a finite number of radio frequencies available for broadcasting. Once the rights to all of them have been purchased, no new competitors can enter the market.\n\nIn some cases, barriers to entry may lead to monopoly. In other cases, they may limit competition to a few firms. Barriers may block entry even if the firm or firms currently in the market are earning profits. Thus, in markets with significant barriers to entry, it is *not* true that abnormally high profits will attract new firms, and that this entry of new firms will eventually cause the price to decline so that surviving firms earn only a normal level of profit in the long run.\n\nThere are two types of monopoly, based on the types of barriers to entry they exploit. One is **natural monopoly**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where the barriers to entry are something other than legal prohibition. The other is **legal monopoly**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where laws prohibit (or severely limit) competition.\n\n### Natural Monopoly\n\n**Economies of scale**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} can combine with the size of the market to limit competition. (This theme was introduced in [Cost and Industry Structure](/m48620)). [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_001) presents a long-run average cost curve for the airplane manufacturing industry. It shows economies of scale up to an output of 8,000 planes per year and a price of P<sub>0</sub>, then constant returns to scale from 8,000 to 20,000 planes per year, and diseconomies of scale at a quantity of production greater than 20,000 planes per year.\n\nNow consider the market demand curve in the diagram, which intersects the long-run average cost (LRAC) curve at an output level of 6,000 planes per year and at a price P<sub>1</sub>, which is higher than P<sub>0</sub>. In this situation, the market has room for only one producer. If a second firm attempts to enter the market at a smaller size, say by producing a quantity of 4,000 planes, then its average costs will be higher than the existing firm, and it will be unable to compete. If the second firm attempts to enter the market at a larger size, like 8,000 planes per year, then it could produce at a lower average cost\u2014but it could not sell all 8,000 planes that it produced because of insufficient demand in the market.\n\n  curve at its downward-sloping part. A natural monopoly occurs when the quantity demanded is less than the minimum quantity it takes to be at the bottom of the long-run average cost curve.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C09_001 data-title=\"Economies of Scale and Natural Monopoly \"}\n\nThis situation, when economies of scale are large relative to the quantity demanded in the market, is called a natural monopoly. Natural monopolies often arise in industries where the marginal cost of adding an additional customer is very low, once the fixed costs of the overall system are in place. Once the main water pipes are laid through a neighborhood, the marginal cost of providing water service to another home is fairly low. Once electricity lines are installed through a neighborhood, the marginal cost of providing additional electrical service to one more home is very low. It would be costly and duplicative for a second water company to enter the market and invest in a whole second set of main water pipes, or for a second electricity company to enter the market and invest in a whole new set of electrical wires. These industries offer an example where, because of economies of scale, one producer can serve the entire market more efficiently than a number of smaller producers that would need to make duplicate physical capital investments.\n\nA natural monopoly can also arise in smaller local markets for products that are difficult to transport. For example, cement production exhibits economies of scale, and the quantity of cement demanded in a local area may not be much larger than what a single plant can produce. Moreover, the costs of transporting cement over land are high, and so a cement plant in an area without access to water transportation may be a natural monopoly.\n\n### Control of a Physical Resource\n\nAnother type of natural monopoly occurs when a company has control of a scarce physical resource. In the U.S. economy, one historical example of this pattern occurred when ALCOA\u2014the Aluminum Company of America\u2014controlled most of the supply of bauxite, a key mineral used in making aluminum. Back in the 1930s, when ALCOA controlled most of the bauxite, other firms were simply unable to produce enough aluminum to compete.\n\nAs another example, the majority of global diamond production is controlled by DeBeers, a multi-national company that has mining and production operations in South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, and Canada. It also has exploration activities on four continents, while directing a worldwide distribution network of rough cut diamonds. Though in recent years they have experienced growing competition, their impact on the rough diamond market is still considerable.\n\n### Legal Monopoly\n\nFor some products, the government erects barriers to entry by prohibiting or limiting competition. Under U.S. law, no organization but the U.S. Postal Service is legally allowed to deliver first-class mail. Many states or cities have laws or regulations that allow households a choice of only one electric company, one water company, and one company to pick up the garbage. Most legal monopolies are considered utilities\u2014products necessary for everyday life\u2014that are socially beneficial to have. As a consequence, the government allows producers to become regulated monopolies, to insure that an appropriate amount of these products is provided to consumers. Additionally, legal monopolies are often subject to economies of scale, so it makes sense to allow only one provider.\n\n### Promoting Innovation\n\nInnovation takes time and resources to achieve. Suppose a company invests in research and development and finds the cure for the common cold. In this world of near ubiquitous information, other companies could take the formula, produce the drug, and because they did not incur the costs of research and development (R&amp;D), undercut the price of the company that discovered the drug. Given this possibility, many firms would choose not to invest in research and development, and as a result, the world would have less innovation. To prevent this from happening, the Constitution of the United States specifies in Article I, Section 8: \u201cThe Congress shall have Power . . . To Promote the Progress of Science and Useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the Exclusive Right to their Writings and Discoveries.\u201d Congress used this power to create the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as the U.S. Copyright Office. A **patent**{: data-type=\"term\"} gives the inventor the exclusive legal right to make, use, or sell the invention for a limited time; in the United States, exclusive patent rights last for 20 years. The idea is to provide limited monopoly power so that innovative firms can recoup their investment in R&amp;D, but then to allow other firms to produce the product more cheaply once the patent expires.\n\nA **trademark**{: data-type=\"term\"} is an identifying symbol or name for a particular good, like Chiquita bananas, Chevrolet cars, or the Nike \u201cswoosh\u201d that appears on shoes and athletic gear. Roughly 1.9 million trademarks are registered with the U.S. government. A firm can renew a trademark over and over again, as long as it remains in active use.\n\nA **copyright**{: data-type=\"term\"}, according to the U.S. Copyright Office, \u201cis a form of protection provided by the laws of the United States for \u2018original works of authorship\u2019 including literary, dramatic, musical, architectural, cartographic, choreographic, pantomimic, pictorial, graphic, sculptural, and audiovisual creations.\u201d No one can reproduce, display, or perform a copyrighted work without permission of the author. Copyright protection ordinarily lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years.\n\nRoughly speaking, patent law covers inventions and copyright protects books, songs, and art. But in certain areas, like the invention of new software, it has been unclear whether patent or copyright protection should apply. There is also a body of law known as **trade secrets**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Even if a company does not have a patent on an invention, competing firms are not allowed to steal their secrets. One famous trade secret is the formula for Coca-Cola, which is not protected under copyright or patent law, but is simply kept secret by the company.\n\nTaken together, this combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret law is called **intellectual property**{: data-type=\"term\"}, because it implies ownership over an idea, concept, or image, not a physical piece of property like a house or a car. Countries around the world have enacted laws to protect intellectual property, although the time periods and exact provisions of such laws vary across countries. There are ongoing negotiations, both through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and through international treaties, to bring greater harmony to the intellectual property laws of different countries to determine the extent to which patents and copyrights in one country will be respected in other countries.\n\nGovernment limitations on competition used to be even more common in the United States. For most of the twentieth century, only one phone company\u2014AT&amp;T\u2014was legally allowed to provide local and long distance service. From the 1930s to the 1970s, one set of federal regulations limited which destinations airlines could choose to fly to and what fares they could charge; another set of regulations limited the interest rates that banks could pay to depositors; yet another specified what trucking firms could charge customers.\n\nWhat products are considered utilities depends, in part, on the available technology. Fifty years ago, local and long distance telephone service was provided over wires. It did not make much sense to have multiple companies building multiple systems of wiring across towns and across the country. AT&amp;T lost its monopoly on long distance service when the technology for providing phone service changed from wires to microwave and satellite transmission, so that multiple firms could use the same transmission mechanism. The same thing happened to local service, especially in recent years, with the growth in cellular phone systems.\n\nThe combination of improvements in production technologies and a general sense that the markets could provide services adequately led to a wave of **deregulation**{: data-type=\"term\"}, starting in the late 1970s and continuing into the 1990s. This wave eliminated or reduced government restrictions on the firms that could enter, the prices that could be charged, and the quantities that could be produced in many industries, including telecommunications, airlines, trucking, banking, and electricity.\n\nAround the world, from Europe to Latin America to Africa and Asia, many governments continue to control and limit competition in what those governments perceive to be key industries, including airlines, banks, steel companies, oil companies, and telephone companies.\n\n\nVist this [website][1] for examples of some pretty bizarre patents.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Intimidating Potential Competition\n\nBusinesses have developed a number of schemes for creating barriers to entry by deterring potential competitors from entering the market. One method is known as **predatory pricing**{: data-type=\"term\"}, in which a firm uses the threat of sharp price cuts to discourage competition. Predatory pricing is a violation of U.S. antitrust law, but it is difficult to prove.\n\nConsider a large airline that provides most of the flights between two particular cities. A new, small start-up airline decides to offer service between these two cities. The large airline immediately slashes prices on this route to the bone, so that the new entrant cannot make any money. After the new entrant has gone out of business, the incumbent firm can raise prices again.\n\nAfter this pattern is repeated once or twice, potential new entrants may decide that it is not wise to try to compete. Small airlines often accuse larger airlines of predatory pricing: in the early 2000s, for example, ValuJet accused Delta of predatory pricing, Frontier accused United, and Reno Air accused Northwest. In 2015, the Justice Department ruled against American Express and Mastercard for imposing restrictions on retailers who encouraged customers to use lower swipe fees on credit transactions.\n\nIn some cases, large advertising budgets can also act as a way of discouraging the competition. If the only way to launch a successful new national cola drink is to spend more than the promotional budgets of Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola, not too many companies will try. A firmly established brand name can be difficult to dislodge.\n\n### Summing Up Barriers to Entry\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_09_01) lists the barriers to entry that have been discussed here. This list is not exhaustive, since firms have proved to be highly creative in inventing business practices that discourage competition. When barriers to entry exist, perfect competition is no longer a reasonable description of how an industry works. When barriers to entry are high enough, monopoly can result.\n\n<table id=\"Table_09_01\" summary=\"This table consists of three columns and five rows.

These barriers include: economies of scale that lead to natural monopoly; control of a physical resource; legal restrictions on competition; patent, trademark and copyright protection; and practices to intimidate the competition like predatory pricing. Intellectual property refers to legally guaranteed ownership of an idea, rather than a physical item. The laws that protect intellectual property include patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. A natural monopoly arises when economies of scale persist over a large enough range of output that if one firm supplies the entire market, no other firm can enter without facing a cost disadvantage.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nClassify the following as a government-enforced barrier to entry, a barrier to entry that is not government-enforced, or a situation that does not involve a barrier to entry.\n\n1.

This is an example of a government law, but perhaps it is not much of a barrier to entry if most people can pass the safety test and get insurance.\n3.  Trademarks are enforced by government, and therefore are a barrier to entry.\n4.  This is probably not a barrier to entry, since there are a number of different ways of getting pure water.\n5.  This is a barrier to entry, but it is not government-enforced.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose the local electrical utility, a legal monopoly based on economies of scale, was split into four firms of equal size, with the idea that eliminating the monopoly would promote competitive pricing of electricity. What do you anticipate would happen to prices?\n\n\n\nBecause of economies of scale, each firm would produce at a higher average cost than before. (They would each have to build their own power lines.) As a result, they would each have to raise prices to cover their higher costs. The policy would fail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Congress reduced the period of patent protection from 20 years to 10 years, what would likely happen to the amount of private research and development?\n\n\n\nShorter patent protection would make innovation less lucrative, so the amount of research and development would likely decline.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nHow is monopoly different from perfect competition?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a barrier to entry?

How do you suppose their barriers to entry were weakened?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are generic pharmaceuticals significantly cheaper than name brand ones?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many years, the Justice Department has tried to break up large firms like IBM, Microsoft, and most recently Google, on the grounds that their large market share made them essentially monopolies. In a global market, where U.S. firms compete with firms from other countries, would this policy make the same sense as it might in a purely domestic context?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual property laws are intended to promote innovation, but some economists, such as Milton Friedman, have argued that such laws are not desirable.

How will this monopoly choose its profit-maximizing quantity of output, and what price will it charge? Profits for the monopolist, like any firm, will be equal to total revenues minus total costs. The pattern of costs for the monopoly can be analyzed within the same framework as the costs of a **perfectly competitive firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\u2014that is, by using total cost, fixed cost, variable cost, marginal cost, average cost, and average variable cost. However, because a monopoly faces no competition, its situation and its decision process will differ from that of a perfectly competitive firm. (The Clear it Up feature discusses how hard it is sometimes to define \u201cmarket\u201d in a monopoly situation.)\n\n### Demand Curves Perceived by a Perfectly Competitive Firm and by a Monopoly\n\nA perfectly competitive firm acts as a price taker, so its calculation of total revenue is made by taking the given market price and multiplying it by the quantity of output that the firm chooses. The demand curve *as it is perceived by a perfectly competitive firm* appears in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_008) (a). The flat perceived demand curve means that, from the viewpoint of the perfectly competitive firm, it could sell either a relatively low quantity like Ql or a relatively high quantity like Qh at the market price P.\n\n A perfectly competitive firm perceives the demand curve that it faces to be flat. The flat shape means that the firm can sell either a low quantity (Ql) or a high quantity (Qh) at exactly the same price (P). (b) A monopolist perceives the demand curve that it faces to be the same as the market demand curve, which for most goods is downward-sloping. Thus, if the monopolist chooses a high level of output (Qh), it can charge only a relatively low price (Pl); conversely, if the monopolist chooses a low level of output (Ql), it can then charge a higher price (Ph). The challenge for the monopolist is to choose the combination of price and quantity that maximizes profits.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C09_008 data-title=\"The Perceived Demand Curve for a Perfect Competitor and a Monopolist \"}\n\n\n\nWhat defines the market?\n\nA monopoly is a firm that sells all or nearly all of the goods and services in a given market. But what defines the \u201cmarket\u201d?\n\nIn a famous 1947 case, the federal government accused the DuPont company of having a monopoly in the cellophane market, pointing out that DuPont produced 75% of the cellophane in the United States. DuPont countered that even though it had a 75% market share in cellophane, it had less than a 20% share of the \u201cflexible packaging materials,\u201d which includes all other moisture-proof papers, films, and foils. In 1956, after years of legal appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the broader market definition was more appropriate, and the case against DuPont was dismissed.\n\nQuestions over how to define the market continue today. True, Microsoft in the 1990s had a dominant share of the software for computer operating systems, but in the total market for all computer software and services, including everything from games to scientific programs, the Microsoft share was only about 14% in 2014. The Greyhound bus company may have a near-monopoly on the market for intercity bus transportation, but it is only a small share of the market for intercity transportation if that market includes private cars, airplanes, and railroad service. DeBeers has a monopoly in diamonds, but it is a much smaller share of the total market for precious gemstones and an even smaller share of the total market for jewelry. A small town in the country may have only one gas station: is this gas station a \u201cmonopoly,\u201d or does it compete with gas stations that might be five, 10, or 50 miles away?\n\nIn general, if a firm produces a product without close substitutes, then the firm can be considered a monopoly producer in a single market. But if buyers have a range of similar\u2014even if not identical\u2014options available from other firms, then the firm is not a monopoly. Still, arguments over whether substitutes are close or not close can be controversial.\n\n\n\nWhile a monopolist can charge *any* price for its product, that price is nonetheless constrained by demand for the firm\u2019s product. No monopolist, even one that is thoroughly protected by high barriers to entry, can require consumers to purchase its product. Because the monopolist is the only firm in the market, its demand curve is the same as the market demand curve, which is, unlike that for a perfectly competitive firm, downward-sloping.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_008) illustrates this situation. The monopolist can either choose a point like R with a low price (Pl) and high quantity (Qh), or a point like S with a high price (Ph) and a low quantity (Ql), or some intermediate point. Setting the price too high will result in a low quantity sold, and will not bring in much revenue. Conversely, setting the price too low may result in a high quantity sold, but because of the low price, it will not bring in much revenue either. The challenge for the monopolist is to strike a profit-maximizing balance between the price it charges and the quantity that it sells. But why isn\u2019t the perfectly competitive firm\u2019s demand curve also the market demand curve? See the following Clear it Up feature for the answer to this question.\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between perceived demand and market demand?\n\nThe demand curve as perceived by a perfectly competitive firm is not the overall market demand curve for that product. However, the firm\u2019s demand curve as perceived by a monopoly is the same as the market demand curve. The reason for the difference is that each perfectly competitive firm perceives the demand for its products in a market that includes many other firms; in effect, the demand curve perceived by a perfectly competitive firm is a tiny slice of the entire market demand curve. In contrast, a monopoly perceives demand for its product in a market where the monopoly is the only producer.\n\n\n\n### Total Cost and Total Revenue for a Monopolist\n\nProfits for a monopolist can be illustrated with a graph of total revenues and total costs, as shown with the example of the hypothetical HealthPill firm in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_004). The total cost curve has its typical shape; that is, total costs rise and the curve grows steeper as output increases.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C09_004 data-title=\"Total Revenue and Total Cost for the HealthPill Monopoly \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_09_02\" summary=\"This table has 6 columns labeled quantity, total cost, quantity, price, total revenue, and profit = total revenue minus total cost.

[\\[link\\]](#Table_09_02) shows quantities along the demand curve and the price at each quantity demanded, and then calculates total revenue by multiplying price times quantity at each level of output. (In this example, the output is given as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, for the sake of simplicity. If you prefer a dash of greater realism, you can imagine that these output levels and the corresponding prices are measured per 1,000 or 10,000 pills.) As the figure illustrates, total revenue for a monopolist rises, flattens out, and then falls. In this example, total revenue is highest at a quantity of 6 or 7.\n\nClearly, the total revenue for a monopolist is not a straight upward-sloping line, in the way that total revenue was for a perfectly competitive firm. The different total revenue pattern for a monopolist occurs because the quantity that a monopolist chooses to produce affects the market price, which was not true for a perfectly competitive firm. If the monopolist charges a very high price, then quantity demanded drops, and so total revenue is very low. If the monopolist charges a very low price, then, even if quantity demanded is very high, total revenue will not add up to much. At some intermediate level, total revenue will be highest.\n\nHowever, the monopolist is not seeking to maximize revenue, but instead to earn the highest possible profit. Profits are calculated in the final row of the table. In the HealthPill example in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_004), the highest profit will occur at the quantity where total revenue is the farthest above total cost. Of the choices given in the table, the highest profits occur at an output of 4, where profit is 800.\n\n### Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost for a Monopolist\n\nIn the real world, a monopolist often does not have enough information to analyze its entire total revenues or total costs curves; after all, the firm does not know exactly what would happen if it were to alter production dramatically. But a monopolist often has fairly reliable information about how changing output by small or moderate amounts will affect its marginal revenues and marginal costs, because it has had experience with such changes over time and because modest changes are easier to extrapolate from current experience. A monopolist can use information on **marginal revenue**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **marginal cost**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} to seek out the profit-maximizing combination of quantity and price.\n\nThe first four columns of [\\[link\\]](#Table_09_03) use the numbers on total cost from the HealthPill example in the previous exhibit and calculate marginal cost and average cost. This monopoly faces a typical upward-sloping marginal cost curve, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_005). The second four columns of [\\[link\\]](#Table_09_03) use the total revenue information from the previous exhibit and calculate marginal revenue.\n\nNotice that marginal revenue is zero at a quantity of 7, and turns negative at quantities higher than 7. It may seem counterintuitive that marginal revenue could ever be zero or negative: after all, does an increase in quantity sold not always mean more revenue? For a perfect competitor, each additional unit sold brought a positive marginal revenue, because marginal revenue was equal to the given market price. But a monopolist can sell a larger quantity and see a decline in **total revenue**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. When a monopolist increases sales by one unit, it gains some marginal revenue from selling that extra unit, but also loses some marginal revenue because every other unit must now be sold at a lower price. As the quantity sold becomes higher, the drop in price affects a greater quantity of sales, eventually causing a situation where more sales cause marginal revenue to be negative.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C09_005 data-title=\"Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost for the HealthPill Monopoly \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_09_03\" summary=\"This table has two columns with four subcolumns each.

If the marginal revenue exceeds the marginal cost, then the firm should produce the extra unit.\n\nFor example, at an output of 3 in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_005), marginal revenue is 800 and marginal cost is 400, so producing this unit will clearly add to overall profits. At an output of 4, marginal revenue is 600 and marginal cost is 600, so producing this unit still means overall profits are unchanged. However, expanding output from 4 to 5 would involve a marginal revenue of 400 and a marginal cost of 700, so that fifth unit would actually reduce profits. Thus, the monopoly can tell from the marginal revenue and marginal cost that of the choices given in the table, the profit-maximizing level of output is 4.\n\nIndeed, the monopoly could seek out the profit-maximizing level of output by increasing quantity by a small amount, calculating marginal revenue and marginal cost, and then either increasing output as long as marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost or reducing output if marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue. This process works without any need to calculate total revenue and total cost. Thus, a profit-maximizing monopoly should follow the rule of producing up to the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost\u2014that is, MR = MC.\n\n\n\nMaximizing Profits\n\nIf you find it counterintuitive that producing where marginal revenue equals marginal cost will maximize profits, working through the numbers will help.\n\nStep 1. Remember that marginal cost is defined as the change in total cost from producing a small amount of additional output.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>MC</mtext><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0total\u00a0cost</mtext><mtext>change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity\u00a0produced</mtext></mfrac></math>\n\nStep 2. Note that in [\\[link\\]](#Table_09_03), as output increases from 1 to 2 units, total cost increases from $1500 to $1800.

It is defined as marginal revenue minus marginal cost. Finally, total profit is the sum of marginal profits. As long as marginal profit is positive, producing more output will increase total profits. When marginal profit turns negative, producing more output will decrease total profits. Total profit is maximized where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In this example, maximum profit occurs at 4 units of output.\n\nA perfectly competitive firm will also find its profit-maximizing level of output where MR = MC. The key difference with a perfectly competitive firm is that in the case of perfect competition, marginal revenue is equal to price (MR = P), while for a monopolist, marginal revenue is not equal to the price, because changes in quantity of output affect the price.\n\n### Illustrating Monopoly Profits\n\nIt is straightforward to calculate profits of given numbers for total revenue and total cost. However, the size of monopoly profits can also be illustrated graphically with [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_006), which takes the marginal cost and marginal revenue curves from the previous exhibit and adds an average cost curve and the monopolist\u2019s perceived demand curve.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C09_006 data-title=\"Illustrating Profits at the HealthPill Monopoly\"}\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_007) illustrates the three-step process where a monopolist: selects the profit-maximizing quantity to produce; decides what price to charge; determines total revenue, total cost, and profit.\n\n**Step 1: The Monopolist Determines Its Profit-Maximizing Level of Output**\n\nThe firm can use the points on the demand curve D to calculate total revenue, and then, based on total revenue, calculate its marginal revenue curve. The profit-maximizing quantity will occur where MR = MC\u2014or at the last possible point before marginal costs start exceeding marginal revenue. On [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_006), MR = MC occurs at an output of 4.\n\n**Step 2: The Monopolist Decides What Price to Charge**\n\nThe monopolist will charge what the market is willing to pay. A dotted line drawn straight up from the profit-maximizing quantity to the demand curve shows the profit-maximizing price. This price is above the average cost curve, which shows that the firm is earning profits.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Profit**\n\nTotal revenue is the overall shaded box, where the width of the box is the quantity being sold and the height is the price. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_006), the bottom part of the shaded box, which is shaded more lightly, shows total costs; that is, quantity on the horizontal axis multiplied by average cost on the vertical axis. The larger box of total revenues minus the smaller box of total costs will equal profits, which is shown by the darkly shaded box. In a perfectly competitive market, the forces of entry would erode this profit in the long run. But a monopolist is protected by barriers to entry. In fact, one telltale sign of a possible monopoly is when a firm earns profits year after year, while doing more or less the same thing, without ever seeing those profits eroded by increased competition.\n\n. In Step 3, the monopoly identifies its profit. Total revenue will be Q1 multiplied by P1. Total cost will be &#10;Q1 multiplied by the average cost of producing Q1, which is shown by point S on the average cost curve to be P2. Profits will be the total revenue rectangle minus the total cost rectangle, shown by the shaded zone in the figure.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C09_007 data-title=\"How a Profit-Maximizing Monopoly Decides Price\"}\n\n\n\nWhy is a monopolist\u2019s marginal revenue always less than the price?\n\nThe marginal revenue curve for a monopolist always lies beneath the market demand curve. To understand why, think about increasing the quantity along the demand curve by one unit, so that you take one step down the demand curve to a slightly higher quantity but a slightly lower price. A demand curve is not sequential: It is not that first we sell Q<sub>1</sub> at a higher price, and then we sell Q<sub>2</sub> at a lower price. Rather, a demand curve is conditional: If we charge the higher price, we would sell Q<sub>1</sub>. If, instead, we charge a lower price (on all the units that we sell), we would sell Q<sub>2</sub>.\n\nSo when we think about increasing the quantity sold by one unit, marginal revenue is affected in two ways. First, we sell one additional unit at the new market price. Second, all the previous units, which could have been sold at the higher price, now sell for less. Because of the lower price on all units sold, the marginal revenue of selling a unit is less than the price of that unit\u2014and the marginal revenue curve is below the demand curve. *Tip*\\: For a straight-line demand curve, MR and demand have the same vertical intercept. As output increases, marginal revenue decreases twice as fast as demand, so that the horizontal intercept of MR is halfway to the horizontal intercept of demand. You can see this in the [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_009).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C09_009 data-title=\"The Monopolist&#x2019;s Marginal Revenue Curve versus Demand Curve\"}\n\n\n\n\n### The Inefficiency of Monopoly\n\nMost people criticize monopolies because they charge too high a price, but what economists object to is that monopolies do not supply enough output to be allocatively efficient. To understand why a monopoly is inefficient, it is useful to compare it with the benchmark model of perfect competition.\n\n**Allocative efficiency**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a social concept. It refers to producing the optimal quantity of some output, the quantity where the marginal benefit to society of one more unit just equals the marginal cost. The rule of profit maximization in a world of perfect competition was for each firm to produce the quantity of output where P = MC, where the price (P) is a measure of how much buyers value the good and the marginal cost (MC) is a measure of what marginal units cost society to produce. Following this rule assures allocative efficiency. If P &gt; MC, then the marginal benefit to society (as measured by P) is greater than the marginal cost to society of producing additional units, and a greater quantity should be produced. But in the case of monopoly, price is always greater than marginal cost at the profit-maximizing level of output, as can be seen by looking back at [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C09_006). Thus, consumers will suffer from a monopoly because a lower quantity will be sold in the market, at a higher price, than would have been the case in a perfectly competitive market.\n\nThe problem of inefficiency for monopolies often runs even deeper than these issues, and also involves incentives for efficiency over longer periods of time. There are counterbalancing incentives here. On one side, firms may strive for new inventions and new intellectual property because they want to become monopolies and earn high profits\u2014at least for a few years until the competition catches up. In this way, monopolies may come to exist because of competitive pressures on firms. However, once a barrier to entry is in place, a monopoly that does not need to fear competition can just produce the same old products in the same old way\u2014while still ringing up a healthy rate of profit. John Hicks, who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1972, wrote in 1935: \u201cThe best of all monopoly profits is a quiet life.\u201d He did not mean the comment in a complimentary way. He meant that monopolies may bank their profits and slack off on trying to please their customers.\n\nWhen AT&amp;T provided all of the local and long-distance phone service in the United States, along with manufacturing most of the phone equipment, the payment plans and types of phones did not change much. The old joke was that you could have any color phone you wanted, as long as it was black. But in 1982, AT&amp;T was split up by government litigation into a number of local phone companies, a long-distance phone company, and a phone equipment manufacturer. An explosion of innovation followed. Services like call waiting, caller ID, three-way calling, voice mail though the phone company, mobile phones, and wireless connections to the Internet all became available. A wide range of payment plans was offered, as well. It was no longer true that all phones were black; instead, phones came in a wide variety of shapes and colors. The end of the telephone monopoly brought lower prices, a greater quantity of services, and also a wave of innovation aimed at attracting and pleasing customers.\n\n\n\nThe Rest is History\n\nIn the opening case, the East India Company and the Confederate States were presented as a monopoly or near monopoly provider of a good. Nearly every American schoolchild knows the result of the \u2018unwelcome visit\u2019 the \u2018Mohawks\u2019 bestowed upon Boston Harbor\u2019s tea-bearing ships\u2014the Boston Tea Party. Regarding the cotton industry, we also know Great Britain remained neutral during the Civil War, taking neither side during the conflict.\n\nDid the monopoly nature of these business have unintended and historical consequences? Might the American Revolution have been deterred, if the East India Company had sailed the tea-bearing ships back to England? Might the southern states have made different decisions had they not been so confident \u201cKing Cotton\u201d would force diplomatic recognition of the Confederate States of America? Of course, it is not possible to definitively answer these questions; after all we cannot roll back the clock and try a different scenario. We can, however, consider the monopoly nature of these businesses and the roles they played and hypothesize about what might have occurred under different circumstances.\n\nPerhaps if there had been legal free tea trade, the colonists would have seen things differently; there was smuggled Dutch tea in the colonial market. If the colonists had been able to freely purchase Dutch tea, they would have paid lower prices and avoided the tax.\n\nWhat about the cotton monopoly? With one in five jobs in Great Britain depending on Southern cotton and the Confederate States nearly the sole provider of that cotton, why did Great Britain remain neutral during the Civil War? At the beginning of the war, Britain simply drew down massive stores of cotton. These stockpiles lasted until near the end of 1862. Why did Britain not recognize the Confederacy at that point? Two reasons: The Emancipation Proclamation and new sources of cotton. Having outlawed slavery throughout the United Kingdom in 1833, it was politically impossible for Great Britain, empty cotton warehouses or not, to recognize, diplomatically, the Confederate States. In addition, during the two years it took to draw down the stockpiles, Britain expanded cotton imports from India, Egypt, and Brazil.\n\nMonopoly sellers often see no threats to their superior marketplace position. In these examples did the power of the monopoly blind the decision makers to other possibilities? Perhaps. But, as they say, the rest is history.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA monopolist is not a price taker, because when it decides what quantity to produce, it also determines the market price. For a monopolist, total revenue is relatively low at low quantities of output, because not much is being sold. Total revenue is also relatively low at very high quantities of output, because a very high quantity will sell only at a low price. Thus, total revenue for a monopolist will start low, rise, and then decline. The marginal revenue for a monopolist from selling additional units will decline. Each additional unit sold by a monopolist will push down the overall market price, and as more units are sold, this lower price applies to more and more units.\n\nThe monopolist will select the profit-maximizing level of output where MR = MC, and then charge the price for that quantity of output as determined by the market demand curve. If that price is above average cost, the monopolist earns positive profits.\n\nMonopolists are not productively efficient, because they do not produce at the minimum of the average cost curve. Monopolists are not allocatively efficient, because they do not produce at the quantity where P = MC. As a result, monopolists produce less, at a higher average cost, and charge a higher price than would a combination of firms in a perfectly competitive industry. Monopolists also may lack incentives for innovation, because they need not fear entry.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nSuppose demand for a monopoly\u2019s product falls so that its profit-maximizing price is below average variable cost. How much output should the firm supply? *Hint*: Draw the graph.\n\n\n\nIf price falls below AVC, the firm will not be able to earn enough revenues even to cover its variable costs. In such a case, it will suffer a smaller loss if it shuts down and produces no output. By contrast, if it stayed in operation and produced the level of output where MR = MC, it would lose all of its fixed costs plus some variable costs. If it shuts down, it only loses its fixed costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine a monopolist could charge a different price to every customer based on how much he or she were willing to pay. How would this affect monopoly profits?\n\n\n\nThis scenario is called \u201cperfect price discrimination.\u201d The result would be that the monopolist would produce more output, the same amount in fact as would be produced by a perfectly competitive industry. However, there would be no consumer surplus since each buyer is paying exactly what they think the product is worth. Therefore, the monopolist would be earning the maximum possible profits.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nHow is the demand curve perceived by a perfectly competitive firm different from the demand curve perceived by a monopolist?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the demand curve perceived by a monopolist compare with the market demand curve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs a monopolist a price taker? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the usual shape of a total revenue curve for a monopolist? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the usual shape of a marginal revenue curve for a monopolist?

Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the quantity produced and price charged by a monopolist compare to that of a perfectly competitive firm?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nImagine that you are managing a small firm and thinking about entering the market of a monopolist. The monopolist is currently charging a high price, and you have calculated that you can make a nice profit charging 10% less than the monopolist. Before you go ahead and challenge the monopolist, what possibility should you consider for how the monopolist might react?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a monopoly firm is earning profits, how much would you expect these profits to be diminished by entry in the long run?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nDraw the demand curve, marginal revenue, and marginal cost curves from [[link]](#CNX_Econ_C09_006), and identify the quantity of output the monopoly wishes to supply and the price it will charge. Suppose demand for the monopoly\u2019s product increases dramatically. Draw the new demand curve. What happens to the marginal revenue as a result of the increase in demand? What happens to the marginal cost curve? Identify the new profit-maximizing quantity and price. Does the answer make sense to you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw a monopolist\u2019s demand curve, marginal revenue, and marginal cost curves. Identify the monopolist\u2019s profit-maximizing output level. Now, think about a slightly higher level of output (say Q<sub>0</sub> + 1). According to the graph, is there any consumer willing to pay more than the marginal cost of that new level of output? If so, what does this mean?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nAboukhadijeh, Feross. \u201cChapter 20: Girding for War - The North and the South, 1861-1865.\u201d *StudyNotes, Inc*.

Hardly! Both have been the center of clandestine meetings and secret deals worthy of a spy novel. In France, between 1997 and 2004, the top four laundry detergent producers (Proctor &amp; Gamble, Henkel, Unilever, and Colgate-Palmolive) controlled about 90 percent of the French soap market. Officials from the soap firms were meeting secretly, in out-of-the-way, small caf\u00e9s around Paris. Their goals: Stamp out competition and set prices.\n\nAround the same time, the top five Midwest ice makers (Home City Ice, Lang Ice, Tinley Ice, Sisler\u2019s Dairy, and Products of Ohio) had similar goals in mind when they secretly agreed to divide up the bagged ice market.\n\nIf both groups could meet their goals, it would enable each to act as though they were a single firm\u2014in essence, a monopoly\u2014and enjoy monopoly-size profits. The problem? In many parts of the world, including the European Union and the United States, it is illegal for firms to divide up markets and set prices collaboratively.\n\nThese two cases provide examples of markets that are characterized neither as perfect competition nor monopoly. Instead, these firms are competing in market structures that lie between the extremes of monopoly and perfect competition. How do they behave? Why do they exist? We will revisit this case later, to find out what happened.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Monopolistic Competition\n* Oligopoly\n\n\n\nPerfect competition and monopoly are at opposite ends of the competition spectrum. A perfectly competitive market has many firms selling identical products, who all act as price takers in the face of the competition. If you recall, **price takers**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} are firms that have no market power. They simply have to take the market price as given.\n\nMonopoly arises when a single firm sells a product for which there are no close substitutes. Microsoft, for instance, has been considered a monopoly because of its domination of the operating systems market.\n\nWhat about the vast majority of real world firms and organizations that fall between these extremes, firms that could be described as **imperfectly competitive**{: data-type=\"term\"}? What determines their behavior? They have more influence over the price they charge than perfectly competitive firms, but not as much as a monopoly would. What will they do?\n\nOne type of imperfectly competitive market is called **monopolistic competition**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Monopolistically competitive markets feature a large number of competing firms, but the products that they sell are not identical. Consider, as an example, the Mall of America in Minnesota, the largest shopping mall in the United States. In 2010, the Mall of America had 24 stores that sold women\u2019s \u201cready-to-wear\u201d clothing (like Ann Taylor and Urban Outfitters), another 50 stores that sold clothing for both men and women (like Banana Republic, J. Crew, and Nordstrom\u2019s), plus 14 more stores that sold women\u2019s specialty clothing (like Motherhood Maternity and Victoria\u2019s Secret). Most of the markets that consumers encounter at the retail level are monopolistically competitive.\n\nThe other type of imperfectly competitive market is **oligopoly**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Oligopolistic markets are those dominated by a small number of firms. Commercial aircraft provides a good example: Boeing and Airbus each produce slightly less than 50% of the large commercial aircraft in the world. Another example is the U.S. soft drink industry, which is dominated by Coca-Cola and Pepsi. Oligopolies are characterized by high barriers to entry with firms choosing output, pricing, and other decisions strategically based on the decisions of the other firms in the market. In this chapter, we first explore how monopolistically competitive firms will choose their profit-maximizing level of output. We will then discuss oligopolistic firms, which face two conflicting temptations: to collaborate as if they were a single monopoly, or to individually compete to gain profits by expanding output levels and cutting prices. Oligopolistic markets and firms can also take on elements of monopoly and of perfect competition.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48659", "module_title": "Economics - m48659", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48659", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Explain the significance of differentiated products\n* Describe how a monopolistic competitor chooses price and quantity\n* Discuss entry, exit, and efficiency as they pertain to monopolistic competition\n* Analyze how advertising can impact monopolistic competition\n\n\n\nMonopolistic competition involves many **firms**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} competing against each other, but selling products that are distinctive in some way. Examples include stores that sell different styles of clothing; restaurants or grocery stores that sell different kinds of food; and even products like golf balls or beer that may be at least somewhat similar but differ in public perception because of advertising and brand names. There are over 600,000 restaurants in the United States. When products are distinctive, each firm has a mini-monopoly on its particular style or flavor or brand name. However, firms producing such products must also compete with other styles and flavors and brand names. The term \u201cmonopolistic competition\u201d captures this mixture of mini-monopoly and tough competition, and the following Clear It Up feature introduces its derivation.\n\n\n\nWho invented the theory of imperfect competition?\n\nThe theory of imperfect competition was developed by two economists independently but simultaneously in 1933. The first was Edward Chamberlin of Harvard University who published *The Economics of Monopolistic Competition*. The second was Joan Robinson of Cambridge University who published *The Economics of Imperfect Competition*. Robinson subsequently became interested in macroeconomics where she became a prominent Keynesian, and later a post-Keynesian economist. (See the [Welcome to Economics!](/m48590){: .target-chapter} and [The Keynesian Perspective](/m48749){: .target-chapter} chapters for more on Keynes.)\n\n\n\n### Differentiated Products\n\nA firm can try to make its products different from those of its competitors in several ways: physical aspects of the product, location from which the product is sold, intangible aspects of the product, and perceptions of the product. Products that are distinctive in one of these ways are called **differentiated products**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nPhysical aspects of a product include all the phrases you hear in advertisements: unbreakable bottle, nonstick surface, freezer-to-microwave, non-shrink, extra spicy, newly redesigned for your comfort. The location of a firm can also create a difference between producers. For example, a gas station located at a heavily traveled intersection can probably sell more gas, because more cars drive by that corner. A supplier to an automobile manufacturer may find that it is an advantage to locate close to the car factory.\n\nIntangible aspects can differentiate a product, too. Some intangible aspects may be promises like a guarantee of satisfaction or money back, a reputation for high quality, services like free delivery, or offering a loan to purchase the product. Finally, **product differentiation**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} may occur in the minds of buyers. For example, many people could not tell the difference in taste between common varieties of beer or cigarettes if they were blindfolded but, because of past habits and advertising, they have strong preferences for certain brands. Advertising can play a role in shaping these intangible preferences.\n\nThe concept of differentiated products is closely related to the degree of variety that is available. If everyone in the economy wore only blue jeans, ate only white bread, and drank only tap water, then the markets for clothing, food, and drink would be much closer to perfectly competitive. The variety of styles, flavors, locations, and characteristics creates product differentiation and monopolistic competition.\n\n### Perceived Demand for a Monopolistic Competitor\n\nA monopolistically competitive firm perceives a demand for its goods that is an intermediate case between monopoly and competition. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C10_008) offers a reminder that the **demand curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} as faced by a perfectly competitive firm is **perfectly elastic**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} or flat, because the perfectly competitive firm can sell any quantity it wishes at the prevailing **market price**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. In contrast, the demand curve, as faced by a monopolist, is the market demand curve, since a monopolist is the only firm in the market, and hence is downward sloping.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C10_008 data-title=\"Perceived Demand for Firms in Different Competitive Settings \"}\n\nThe demand curve as faced by a monopolistic competitor is not flat, but rather downward-sloping, which means that the monopolistic competitor can raise its price without losing all of its customers or lower the price and gain more customers. Since there are substitutes, the demand curve facing a monopolistically competitive firm is more elastic than that of a monopoly where there are no close substitutes. If a monopolist raises its price, some consumers will choose not to purchase its product\u2014but they will then need to buy a completely different product. However, when a monopolistic competitor raises its price, some consumers will choose not to purchase the product at all, but others will choose to buy a similar product from another firm. If a monopolistic competitor raises its price, it will not lose as many customers as would a perfectly competitive firm, but it will lose more customers than would a monopoly that raised its prices.\n\nAt a glance, the demand curves faced by a monopoly and by a monopolistic competitor look similar\u2014that is, they both slope down. But the underlying economic meaning of these perceived demand curves is different, because a monopolist faces the market demand curve and a monopolistic competitor does not. Rather, a monopolistically competitive firm\u2019s demand curve is but one of many firms that make up the \u201cbefore\u201d market demand curve. Are you following? If so, how would you categorize the market for golf balls? Take a swing, then see the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\nAre golf balls really differentiated products?\n\nMonopolistic competition refers to an industry that has more than a few firms, each offering a product which, from the consumer\u2019s perspective, is different from its competitors. The U.S. Golf Association runs a laboratory that tests 20,000 golf balls a year. There are strict rules for what makes a golf ball legal. The weight of a golf ball cannot exceed 1.620 ounces and its diameter cannot be less than 1.680 inches (which is a weight of 45.93 grams and a diameter of 42.67 millimeters, in case you were wondering). The balls are also tested by being hit at different speeds. For example, the distance test involves having a mechanical golfer hit the ball with a titanium driver and a swing speed of 120 miles per hour. As the testing center explains: \u201cThe USGA system then uses an array of sensors that accurately measure the flight of a golf ball during a short, indoor trajectory from a ball launcher. From this flight data, a computer calculates the lift and drag forces that are generated by the speed, spin, and dimple pattern of the ball. ... The distance limit is 317 yards.\u201d\n\nOver 1800 golf balls made by more than 100 companies meet the USGA standards. The balls do differ in various ways, like the pattern of dimples on the ball, the types of plastic used on the cover and in the cores, and so on. Since all balls need to conform to the USGA tests, they are much more alike than different. In other words, golf ball manufacturers are monopolistically competitive.\n\nHowever, retail sales of golf balls are about $500 million per year, which means that a lot of large companies have a powerful incentive to persuade players that golf balls are highly differentiated and that it makes a huge difference which one you choose. Sure, Tiger Woods can tell the difference. For the average duffer (golf-speak for a \u201cmediocre player\u201d) who plays a few times a summer\u2014and who loses a lot of golf balls to the woods and lake and needs to buy new ones\u2014most golf balls are pretty much indistinguishable.\n\n\n\n### How a Monopolistic Competitor Chooses Price and Quantity\n\nThe monopolistically competitive firm decides on its profit-maximizing quantity and price in much the same way as a monopolist. A monopolistic competitor, like a monopolist, faces a downward-sloping demand curve, and so it will choose some combination of price and quantity along its perceived demand curve.\n\nAs an example of a **profit-maximizing**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} monopolistic competitor, consider the Authentic Chinese Pizza store, which serves pizza with cheese, sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of vegetables and meats. Although Authentic Chinese Pizza must compete against other pizza businesses and restaurants, it has a differentiated product. The firm\u2019s perceived demand curve is downward sloping, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C10_004) and the first two columns of [\\[link\\]](#Table_10_01).\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C10_004 data-title=\"How a Monopolistic Competitor Chooses its Profit Maximizing Output and Price \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_10_01\" summary=\"The table shows a revenue and cost schedule.

The fourth column, marginal revenue, is calculated as the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. The final columns of [\\[link\\]](#Table_10_01) show total cost, marginal cost, and average cost. As always, marginal cost is calculated by dividing the change in total cost by the change in quantity, while average cost is calculated by dividing total cost by quantity. The following Work It Out feature shows how these firms calculate how much of its product to supply at what price.\n\n\n\nHow a Monopolistic Competitor Determines How Much to Produce and at What Price\n\nThe process by which a monopolistic competitor chooses its profit-maximizing quantity and price resembles closely how a monopoly makes these decisions process. First, the firm selects the profit-maximizing quantity to produce. Then the firm decides what price to charge for that quantity.\n\nStep 1. The monopolistic competitor determines its profit-maximizing level of output. In this case, the Authentic Chinese Pizza company will determine the profit-maximizing quantity to produce by considering its marginal revenues and marginal costs. Two scenarios are possible:\n\n* If the firm is producing at a quantity of output where marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, then the firm should keep expanding production, because each marginal unit is adding to profit by bringing in more revenue than its cost. In this way, the firm will produce up to the quantity where MR = MC.\n* If the firm is producing at a quantity where marginal costs exceed marginal revenue, then each marginal unit is costing more than the revenue it brings in, and the firm will increase its profits by reducing the quantity of output until MR = MC.\n\nIn this example, MR and MC intersect at a quantity of 40, which is the profit-maximizing level of output for the firm.\n\nStep 2. The monopolistic competitor decides what price to charge. When the firm has determined its profit-maximizing quantity of output, it can then look to its perceived demand curve to find out what it can charge for that quantity of output. On the graph, this process can be shown as a vertical line reaching up through the profit-maximizing quantity until it hits the firm\u2019s perceived demand curve. For Authentic Chinese Pizza, it should charge a price of $16 per pizza for a quantity of 40.\n\nOnce the firm has chosen price and quantity, it\u2019s in a position to calculate total revenue, total cost, and profit. At a quantity of 40, the price of $16 lies above the average cost curve, so the firm is making economic profits. From [\\[link\\]](#Table_10_01) we can see that, at an output of 40, the firm\u2019s total revenue is $640 and its total cost is $580, so profits are $60. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C10_004), the firm\u2019s total revenues are the rectangle with the quantity of 40 on the horizontal axis and the price of $16 on the vertical axis. The firm\u2019s total costs are the light shaded rectangle with the same quantity of 40 on the horizontal axis but the average cost of $14.50 on the vertical axis. Profits are total revenues minus total costs, which is the shaded area above the average cost curve.\n\n\n\nAlthough the process by which a monopolistic competitor makes decisions about quantity and price is similar to the way in which a monopolist makes such decisions, two differences are worth remembering. First, although both a monopolist and a monopolistic competitor face downward-sloping demand curves, the monopolist\u2019s perceived demand curve is the market demand curve, while the perceived **demand curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} for a monopolistic competitor is based on the extent of its product differentiation and how many competitors it faces. Second, a monopolist is surrounded by barriers to entry and need not fear entry, but a monopolistic competitor who earns profits must expect the entry of firms with similar, but differentiated, products.\n\n### Monopolistic Competitors and Entry\n\nIf one monopolistic competitor earns positive economic profits, other firms will be tempted to enter the market. A gas station with a great location must worry that other gas stations might open across the street or down the road\u2014and perhaps the new gas stations will sell coffee or have a carwash or some other attraction to lure customers. A successful restaurant with a unique barbecue sauce must be concerned that other restaurants will try to copy the sauce or offer their own unique recipes. A laundry detergent with a great reputation for quality must be concerned that other competitors may seek to build their own reputations.\n\nThe entry of other firms into the same general market (like gas, restaurants, or detergent) shifts the demand curve faced by a monopolistically competitive firm. As more firms enter the market, the quantity demanded at a given price for any particular firm will decline, and the firm\u2019s perceived demand curve will shift to the left. As a firm\u2019s perceived demand curve shifts to the left, its marginal revenue curve will shift to the left, too. The shift in marginal revenue will change the profit-maximizing quantity that the firm chooses to produce, since marginal revenue will then equal marginal cost at a lower quantity.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C10_009) (a) shows a situation in which a monopolistic competitor was earning a profit with its original perceived demand curve (D<sub>0</sub>). The intersection of the marginal revenue curve (MR<sub>0</sub>) and marginal cost curve (MC) occurs at point S, corresponding to quantity Q<sub>0</sub>, which is associated on the demand curve at point T with price P<sub>0</sub>. The combination of price P<sub>0</sub> and quantity Q<sub>0</sub> lies above the average cost curve, which shows that the firm is earning positive economic profits.\n\n  At P0 and Q0, the monopolistically competitive firm shown in this figure is making a positive economic profit. This is clear because if you follow the dotted line above Q0, you can see that price is above average cost. Positive economic profits attract competing firms to the industry, driving the original firm&#x2019;s demand down to D1. At the new equilibrium quantity (P1, Q1), the original firm is earning zero economic profits, and entry into the industry ceases. In (b) the opposite occurs. At P0 and Q0, the firm is losing money. If you follow the dotted line above Q0, you can see that average cost is above price. Losses induce firms to leave the industry. When they do, demand for the original firm rises to D1, where once again the firm is earning zero economic profit.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C10_009 data-title=\"Monopolistic Competition, Entry, and Exit \"}\n\nUnlike a monopoly, with its high barriers to entry, a monopolistically competitive firm with positive economic profits will attract competition. When another competitor enters the market, the original firm\u2019s perceived demand curve shifts to the left, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>, and the associated marginal revenue curve shifts from MR<sub>0</sub> to MR<sub>1</sub>. The new profit-maximizing output is Q<sub>1</sub>, because the intersection of the MR<sub>1</sub> and MC now occurs at point U. Moving vertically up from that quantity on the new demand curve, the optimal price is at P<sub>1</sub>.\n\nAs long as the **firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is earning positive economic profits, new competitors will continue to enter the market, reducing the original firm\u2019s demand and marginal revenue curves. The long-run **equilibrium**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is shown in the figure at point Y, where the firm\u2019s perceived demand curve touches the average cost curve. When price is equal to average cost, economic profits are zero. Thus, although a monopolistically competitive firm may earn positive economic profits in the short term, the process of new entry will drive down economic profits to zero in the long run. Remember that zero economic profit is not equivalent to zero **accounting profit**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. A zero economic profit means the firm\u2019s accounting profit is equal to what its resources could earn in their next best use. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C10_009) (b) shows the reverse situation, where a monopolistically competitive firm is originally losing money. The adjustment to long-run equilibrium is analogous to the previous example. The economic losses lead to firms exiting, which will result in increased demand for this particular firm, and consequently lower losses. Firms exit up to the point where there are no more losses in this market, for example when the demand curve touches the average cost curve, as in point Z.\n\nMonopolistic competitors can make an economic profit or loss in the short run, but in the long run, entry and exit will drive these firms toward a zero economic profit outcome. However, the zero economic profit outcome in monopolistic competition looks different from the zero economic profit outcome in perfect competition in several ways relating both to efficiency and to variety in the market.\n\n### Monopolistic Competition and Efficiency\n\nThe long-term result of entry and exit in a perfectly competitive market is that all firms end up selling at the price level determined by the lowest point on the average cost curve. This outcome is why perfect competition displays **productive efficiency**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\\: goods are being produced at the lowest possible average cost. However, in monopolistic competition, the end result of entry and exit is that firms end up with a price that lies on the downward-sloping portion of the average cost curve, not at the very bottom of the AC curve. Thus, monopolistic competition will not be productively efficient.\n\nIn a perfectly competitive market, each firm produces at a quantity where price is set equal to marginal cost, both in the short run and in the long run. This outcome is why perfect competition displays allocative efficiency: the social benefits of additional production, as measured by the marginal benefit, which is the same as the price, equal the marginal costs to society of that production. In a monopolistically competitive market, the rule for maximizing profit is to set MR = MC\u2014and price is higher than marginal revenue, not equal to it because the demand curve is downward sloping. When P &gt; MC, which is the outcome in a monopolistically competitive market, the benefits to society of providing additional quantity, as measured by the price that people are willing to pay, exceed the marginal costs to society of producing those units. A monopolistically competitive firm does not produce more, which means that society loses the net benefit of those extra units. This is the same argument we made about monopoly, but in this case to a lesser degree. Thus, a monopolistically competitive industry will produce a lower quantity of a good and charge a higher price for it than would a perfectly competitive industry. See the following Clear It Up feature for more detail on the impact of demand shifts.\n\n\n\nWhy does a shift in perceived demand cause a shift in marginal revenue?\n\nThe combinations of price and quantity at each point on a firm\u2019s perceived demand curve are used to calculate total revenue for each combination of price and quantity. This information on total revenue is then used to calculate marginal revenue, which is the change in total revenue divided by the change in quantity. A change in perceived demand will change total revenue at every quantity of output and in turn, the change in total revenue will shift marginal revenue at each quantity of output. Thus, when entry occurs in a monopolistically competitive industry, the perceived demand curve for each firm will shift to the left, because a smaller quantity will be demanded at any given price. Another way of interpreting this shift in demand is to notice that, for each quantity sold, a lower price will be charged. Consequently, the marginal revenue will be lower for each quantity sold\u2014and the marginal revenue curve will shift to the left as well. Conversely, exit causes the perceived demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm to shift to the right and the corresponding marginal revenue curve to shift right, too.\n\n\n\nA monopolistically competitive industry does not display productive and allocative efficiency in either the short run, when firms are making economic profits and losses, nor in the long run, when firms are earning zero profits.\n\n### The Benefits of Variety and Product Differentiation\n\nEven though monopolistic competition does not provide productive efficiency or allocative efficiency, it does have benefits of its own. Product differentiation is based on variety and innovation. Many people would prefer to live in an economy with many kinds of clothes, foods, and car styles; not in a world of perfect competition where everyone will always wear blue jeans and white shirts, eat only spaghetti with plain red sauce, and drive an identical model of car. Many people would prefer to live in an economy where firms are struggling to figure out ways of attracting customers by methods like friendlier service, free delivery, guarantees of quality, variations on existing products, and a better shopping experience.\n\nEconomists have struggled, with only partial success, to address the question of whether a market-oriented economy produces the optimal amount of variety. Critics of market-oriented economies argue that society does not really need dozens of different athletic shoes or breakfast cereals or automobiles. They argue that much of the cost of creating such a high degree of product differentiation, and then of advertising and marketing this differentiation, is socially wasteful\u2014that is, most people would be just as happy with a smaller range of **differentiated products**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} produced and sold at a lower price. Defenders of a market-oriented economy respond that if people do not want to buy differentiated products or highly advertised brand names, no one is forcing them to do so. Moreover, they argue that consumers benefit substantially when firms seek short-term profits by providing differentiated products. This controversy may never be fully resolved, in part because deciding on the optimal amount of variety is very difficult, and in part because the two sides often place different values on what variety means for consumers. Read the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion on the role that advertising plays in monopolistic competition.\n\n\n\nHow does advertising impact monopolistic competition?\n\nThe U.S. economy spent about $180.12 billion on advertising in 2014, according to eMarketer.com. Roughly one third of this was television advertising, and another third was divided roughly equally between Internet, newspapers, and radio. The remaining third was divided up between direct mail, magazines, telephone directory yellow pages, and billboards. Mobile devices are increasing the opportunities for advertisers.\n\nAdvertising is all about explaining to people, or making people believe, that the products of one firm are differentiated from the products of another firm. In the framework of monopolistic competition, there are two ways to conceive of how advertising works: either advertising causes a firm\u2019s perceived demand curve to become more inelastic (that is, it causes the perceived demand curve to become steeper); or advertising causes demand for the firm\u2019s product to increase (that is, it causes the firm\u2019s perceived demand curve to shift to the right). In either case, a successful advertising campaign may allow a firm to sell either a greater quantity or to charge a higher price, or both, and thus increase its profits.\n\nHowever, economists and business owners have also long suspected that much of the advertising may only offset other advertising. Economist A. C. Pigou wrote the following back in 1920 in his book, *The Economics of Welfare*\\:\n\n<q>It may happen that expenditures on advertisement made by competing monopolists \\[that is, what we now call monopolistic competitors\\] will simply neutralise one another, and leave the industrial position exactly as it would have been if neither had expended anything. For, clearly, if each of two rivals makes equal efforts to attract the favour of the public away from the other, the total result is the same as it would have been if neither had made any effort at all.</q>\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nMonopolistic competition refers to a market where many firms sell differentiated products. Differentiated products can arise from characteristics of the good or service, location from which the product is sold, intangible aspects of the product, and perceptions of the product.\n\nThe perceived demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm is downward-sloping, which shows that it is a price maker and chooses a combination of price and quantity. However, the perceived demand curve for a monopolistic competitor is more elastic than the perceived demand curve for a monopolist, because the monopolistic competitor has direct competition, unlike the pure monopolist. A profit-maximizing monopolistic competitor will seek out the quantity where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. The monopolistic competitor will produce that level of output and charge the price that is indicated by the firm\u2019s demand curve.\n\nIf the firms in a monopolistically competitive industry are earning economic profits, the industry will attract entry until profits are driven down to zero in the long run. If the firms in a monopolistically competitive industry are suffering economic losses, then the industry will experience exit of firms until economic profits are driven up to zero in the long run.\n\nA monopolistically competitive firm is not productively efficient because it does not produce at the minimum of its average cost curve. A monopolistically competitive firm is not allocatively efficient because it does not produce where P = MC, but instead produces where P &gt; MC. Thus, a monopolistically competitive firm will tend to produce a lower quantity at a higher cost and to charge a higher price than a perfectly competitive firm.\n\nMonopolistically competitive industries do offer benefits to consumers in the form of greater variety and incentives for improved products and services. There is some controversy over whether a market-oriented economy generates too much variety.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nSuppose that, due to a successful advertising campaign, a monopolistic competitor experiences an increase in demand for its product. How will that affect the price it charges and the quantity it supplies?\n\n\n\nAn increase in demand will manifest itself as a rightward shift in the demand curve, and a rightward shift in marginal revenue. The shift in marginal revenue will cause a movement up the marginal cost curve to the new intersection between MR and MC at a higher level of output. The new price can be read by drawing a line up from the new output level to the new demand curve, and then over to the vertical axis. The new price should be higher. The increase in quantity will cause a movement along the average cost curve to a possibly higher level of average cost. The price, though, will increase more, causing an increase in total profits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing with the scenario outlined in question 1, in the long run, the positive economic profits earned by the monopolistic competitor will attract a response either from existing firms in the industry or firms outside. As those firms capture the original firm\u2019s profit, what will happen to the original firm\u2019s profit-maximizing price and output levels?\n\n\n\nAs long as the original firm is earning positive economic profits, other firms will respond in ways that take away the original firm\u2019s profits. This will manifest itself as a decrease in demand for the original firm\u2019s product, a decrease in the firm\u2019s profit-maximizing price and a decrease in the firm\u2019s profit-maximizing level of output, essentially unwinding the process described in the answer to question 1. In the long-run equilibrium, all firms in monopolistically competitive markets will earn zero economic profits.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between product differentiation and monopolistic competition?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the perceived demand curve for a monopolistically competitive firm different from the perceived demand curve for a monopoly or a perfectly competitive firm?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does a monopolistic competitor choose its profit-maximizing quantity of output and price?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can a monopolistic competitor tell whether the price it is charging will cause the firm to earn profits or experience losses?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the firms in a monopolistically competitive market are earning economic profits or losses in the short run, would you expect them to continue doing so in the long run? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs a monopolistically competitive firm productively efficient? Is it allocatively efficient? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nAside from advertising, how can monopolistically competitive firms increase demand for their products?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a case for why monopolistically competitive industries never reach long-run equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you rather have efficiency or variety? That is, one opportunity cost of the variety of products we have is that each product costs more per unit than if there were only one kind of product of a given type, like shoes. Perhaps a better question is, \u201cWhat is the right amount of variety? Can there be too many varieties of shoes, for example?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nAndrea\u2019s Day Spa began to offer a relaxing aromatherapy treatment. The firm asks you how much to charge to maximize profits. The demand curve for the treatments is given by the first two columns in [[link]](#Table_10_02); its total costs are given in the third column.

What is the profit-maximizing level of output for the treatments and how much will the firm earn in profits?\n\n<table id=\"Table_10_02\" summary=\"The table shows the price, quantity and total cost (TC).

Rather, they are oligopolies. **Oligopoly**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} arises when a small number of large firms have all or most of the sales in an industry. Examples of oligopoly abound and include the auto industry, cable television, and commercial air travel. Oligopolistic firms are like cats in a bag. They can either scratch each other to pieces or cuddle up and get comfortable with one another. If oligopolists compete hard, they may end up acting very much like perfect competitors, driving down costs and leading to zero profits for all. If oligopolists collude with each other, they may effectively act like a monopoly and succeed in pushing up prices and earning consistently high levels of profit. Oligopolies are typically characterized by mutual interdependence where various decisions such as output, price, advertising, and so on, depend on the decisions of the other firm(s). Analyzing the choices of oligopolistic firms about pricing and quantity produced involves considering the pros and cons of competition versus collusion at a given point in time.\n\n### Why Do Oligopolies Exist?\n\nA combination of the barriers to entry that create monopolies and the product differentiation that characterizes monopolistic competition can create the setting for an oligopoly. For example, when a government grants a patent for an invention to one firm, it may create a monopoly. When the government grants patents to, for example, three different pharmaceutical companies that each has its own drug for reducing high blood pressure, those three firms may become an oligopoly.\n\nSimilarly, a **natural monopoly**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} will arise when the quantity demanded in a market is only large enough for a single firm to operate at the minimum of the long-run average cost curve. In such a setting, the market has room for only one firm, because no smaller firm can operate at a low enough average cost to compete, and no larger firm could sell what it produced given the quantity demanded in the market.\n\n**Quantity demanded**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} in the market may also be two or three times the quantity needed to produce at the minimum of the average cost curve\u2014which means that the market would have room for only two or three oligopoly firms (and they need not produce differentiated products). Again, smaller firms would have higher average costs and be unable to compete, while additional large firms would produce such a high quantity that they would not be able to sell it at a profitable price. This combination of economies of scale and market demand creates the barrier to entry, which led to the Boeing-Airbus oligopoly for large passenger aircraft.\n\nThe product differentiation at the heart of monopolistic competition can also play a role in creating oligopoly. For example, firms may need to reach a certain minimum size before they are able to spend enough on advertising and marketing to create a recognizable brand name. The problem in competing with, say, Coca-Cola or Pepsi is not that producing fizzy drinks is technologically difficult, but rather that creating a brand name and marketing effort to equal Coke or Pepsi is an enormous task.\n\n### Collusion or Competition?\n\nWhen oligopoly firms in a certain market decide what quantity to produce and what price to charge, they face a temptation to act as if they were a monopoly. By acting together, oligopolistic firms can hold down industry output, charge a higher price, and divide up the profit among themselves. When firms act together in this way to reduce output and keep prices high, it is called **collusion**{: data-type=\"term\"}. A group of firms that have a formal agreement to collude to produce the monopoly output and sell at the monopoly price is called a **cartel**{: data-type=\"term\"}. See the following Clear It Up feature for a more in-depth analysis of the difference between the two.\n\n\n\nCollusion versus cartels: How can I tell which is which?\n\nIn the United States, as well as many other countries, it is illegal for firms to collude since collusion is anti-competitive behavior, which is a violation of antitrust law. Both the **Antitrust Division of the Justice Department**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and the **Federal Trade Commission**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} have responsibilities for preventing collusion in the United States.\n\nThe problem of enforcement is finding hard evidence of collusion. Cartels are formal agreements to collude. Because cartel agreements provide evidence of collusion, they are rare in the United States. Instead, most collusion is tacit, where firms implicitly reach an understanding that competition is bad for profits.\n\n\n\nThe desire of businesses to avoid competing so that they can instead raise the prices that they charge and earn higher profits has been well understood by economists. **Adam Smith**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} wrote in *Wealth of Nations* in 1776: \u201cPeople of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\u201d\n\nEven when oligopolists recognize that they would benefit as a group by acting like a monopoly, each individual oligopoly faces a private temptation to produce just a slightly higher quantity and earn slightly higher profit\u2014while still counting on the other oligopolists to hold down their production and keep prices high. If at least some oligopolists give in to this temptation and start producing more, then the market price will fall. Indeed, a small handful of oligopoly firms may end up competing so fiercely that they all end up earning zero economic profits\u2014as if they were perfect competitors.\n\n### The Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\n\nBecause of the complexity of oligopoly, which is the result of mutual interdependence among firms, there is no single, generally-accepted theory of how oligopolies behave, in the same way that we have theories for all the other market structures. Instead, economists use **game theory**{: data-type=\"term\"}, a branch of mathematics that analyzes situations in which players must make decisions and then receive payoffs based on what other players decide to do. Game theory has found widespread applications in the social sciences, as well as in business, law, and military strategy.\n\nThe **prisoner\u2019s dilemma**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a scenario in which the gains from cooperation are larger than the rewards from pursuing self-interest. It applies well to oligopoly. The story behind the prisoner\u2019s dilemma goes like this:\n\n<q>Two co-conspiratorial criminals are arrested. When they are taken to the police station, they refuse to say anything and are put in separate interrogation rooms. Eventually, a police officer enters the room where Prisoner A is being held and says: \u201cYou know what? Your partner in the other room is confessing. So your partner is going to get a light prison sentence of just one year, and because you\u2019re remaining silent, the judge is going to stick you with eight years in prison. Why don\u2019t you get smart? If you confess, too, we\u2019ll cut your jail time down to five years, and your partner will get five years, also.\u201d Over in the next room, another police officer is giving exactly the same speech to Prisoner B. What the police officers do not say is that if both prisoners remain silent, the evidence against them is not especially strong, and the prisoners will end up with only two years in jail each.</q>\n\nThe game theory situation facing the two prisoners is shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_10_03). To understand the dilemma, first consider the choices from Prisoner A\u2019s point of view. If A believes that B will confess, then A ought to confess, too, so as to not get stuck with the eight years in prison. But if A believes that B will not confess, then A will be tempted to act selfishly and confess, so as to serve only one year. The key point is that A has an incentive to confess regardless of what choice B makes! B faces the same set of choices, and thus will have an incentive to confess regardless of what choice A makes. Confess is considered the dominant strategy or the strategy an individual (or firm) will pursue regardless of the other individual\u2019s (or firm\u2019s) decision. The result is that if prisoners pursue their own self-interest, both are likely to confess, and end up doing a total of 10 years of jail time between them.\n\n<table id=\"Table_10_03\" summary=\"The table shows the prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma.

If the two prisoners can work out some way of cooperating so that neither one will confess, they will both be better off than if they each follow their own individual self-interest, which in this case leads straight into longer jail terms.\n\n### The Oligopoly Version of the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\n\nThe members of an oligopoly can face a prisoner\u2019s dilemma, also. If each of the oligopolists cooperates in holding down output, then high monopoly profits are possible. Each oligopolist, however, must worry that while it is holding down output, other firms are taking advantage of the high price by raising output and earning higher profits. [\\[link\\]](#Table_10_04) shows the prisoner\u2019s dilemma for a two-firm oligopoly\u2014known as a **duopoly**{: data-type=\"term\"}. If Firms A and B both agree to hold down output, they are acting together as a monopoly and will each earn $1,000 in profits. However, both firms\u2019 dominant strategy is to increase output, in which case each will earn $400 in profits.\n\n<table id=\"Table_10_04\" summary=\"The table shows the prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma for oligopolists. The 4 column 4 row table is modified differently than a standard table. Rows 1 and 2 in Columns 1 and 2 are empty. Columns 3 and 4 show the options for Firm B. Rows 4 and 5 show the options for Firm A.  Firm B can either &#x201C;hold down output (cooperate with other Firm)&#x201D; (column 3 row 2), or increase output (not cooperate with other Firm)&#x201D; (column 4 row 2). Firm A can either &#x201C;hold down output (cooperate with other Firm)&#x201D; (column 2 row 3), or increase output (not cooperate with other Firm)&#x201D; (column 2 row 4). The possible outcomes are as follows: If both Firms hold down output: A gets $1,000, B gets $1,000 (column 3 row 3); if Firm B holds down output but Firm A increases output : A gets $1,500 years, B gets $200 (column 3 row 4); if Firm B increases output but Firm A holds down output: A gets $200, B gets $1,500 (column 4 row 3); if both Firms increase output: A gets $400, B gets $400 (column 4 row 4).\"><caption><span data-type=\"title\">A Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma for Oligopolists</span></caption><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" />\n<td colspan=\"2\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Firm B</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\n<td>Hold Down Output (cooperate with other firm)</td>\n<td>Increase Output (do not cooperate with other firm)</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Firm A</strong></td>\n<td>Hold Down Output (cooperate with other firm)</td>\n<td>A gets $1,000, B gets $1,000</td>\n<td>A gets $200, B gets $1,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\n<td>Increase Output (do not cooperate with other firm)</td>\n<td>A gets $1,500, B gets $200</td>\n<td>A gets $400, B gets $400</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\nCan the two firms trust each other? Consider the situation of Firm A:\n\n* If A thinks that B will cheat on their agreement and increase output, then A will increase output, too, because for A the profit of $400 when both firms increase output (the bottom right-hand choice in [\\[link\\]](#Table_10_04)) is better than a profit of only $200 if A keeps output low and B raises output (the upper right-hand choice in the table).\n* If A thinks that B will cooperate by holding down output, then A may seize the opportunity to earn higher profits by raising output. After all, if B is going to hold down output, then A can earn $1,500 in profits by expanding output (the bottom left-hand choice in the table) compared with only $1,000 by holding down output as well (the upper left-hand choice in the table).\n\nThus, firm A will reason that it makes sense to expand output if B holds down output and that it also makes sense to expand output if B raises output. Again, B faces a parallel set of decisions.\n\nThe result of this prisoner\u2019s dilemma is often that even though A and B could make the highest combined profits by cooperating in producing a lower level of output and acting like a monopolist, the two firms may well end up in a situation where they each increase **output**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and earn only $400 each in **profits**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. The following Clear It Up feature discusses one cartel scandal in particular.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Lysine cartel?\n\nLysine, a $600 million-a-year industry, is an amino acid used by farmers as a feed additive to ensure the proper growth of swine and poultry. The primary U.S. producer of lysine is Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), but several other large European and Japanese firms are also in this market. For a time in the first half of the 1990s, the world\u2019s major lysine producers met together in hotel conference rooms and decided exactly how much each firm would sell and what it would charge. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), however, had learned of the cartel and placed wire taps on a number of their phone calls and meetings.\n\nFrom FBI surveillance tapes, following is a comment that Terry Wilson, president of the corn processing division at ADM, made to the other lysine producers at a 1994 meeting in Mona, Hawaii:\n\n<q>I wanna go back and I wanna say something very simple. If we\u2019re going to trust each other, okay, and if I\u2019m assured that I\u2019m gonna get 67,000 tons by the year\u2019s end, we\u2019re gonna sell it at the prices we agreed to . . . The only thing we need to talk about there because we are gonna get manipulated by these \\[expletive\\] buyers\u2014they can be smarter than us if we let them be smarter. . . . They \\[the customers\\] are not your friend. They are not my friend. And we gotta have \u2018em, but they are not my friends. You are my friend. I wanna be closer to you than I am to any customer. Cause you can make us ... money. ... And all I wanna tell you again is let\u2019s\u2014let\u2019s put the prices on the board. Let\u2019s all agree that\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do and then walk out of here and do it. </q>\n\nThe price of lysine doubled while the cartel was in effect. Confronted by the FBI tapes, Archer Daniels Midland pled guilty in 1996 and paid a fine of $100 million. A number of top executives, both at ADM and other firms, later paid fines of up to $350,000 and were sentenced to 24\u201330 months in prison.\n\nIn another one of the FBI recordings, the president of Archer Daniels Midland told an executive from another competing firm that ADM had a slogan that, in his words, had \u201cpenetrated the whole company.\u201d The company president stated the slogan this way: \u201cOur competitors are our friends. Our customers are the enemy.\u201d That slogan could stand as the motto of cartels everywhere.\n\n\n\n### How to Enforce Cooperation\n\nHow can parties who find themselves in a prisoner\u2019s dilemma situation avoid the undesired outcome and cooperate with each other? The way out of a prisoner\u2019s dilemma is to find a way to penalize those who do not cooperate.\n\nPerhaps the easiest approach for colluding oligopolists, as you might imagine, would be to sign a contract with each other that they will hold output low and keep prices high. If a group of U.S. companies signed such a contract, however, it would be illegal. Certain international organizations, like the nations that are members of the **Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, have signed international agreements to act like a monopoly, hold down output, and keep prices high so that all of the countries can make high profits from oil exports. Such agreements, however, because they fall in a gray area of international law, are not legally enforceable. If Nigeria, for example, decides to start cutting prices and selling more oil, Saudi Arabia cannot sue Nigeria in court and force it to stop.\n\n\nVisit the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries [website][1] and learn more about its history and how it defines itself.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nBecause oligopolists cannot sign a legally enforceable contract to act like a monopoly, the firms may instead keep close tabs on what other firms are producing and charging. Alternatively, oligopolists may choose to act in a way that generates pressure on each firm to stick to its agreed quantity of output.\n\nOne example of the pressure these firms can exert on one another is the **kinked demand curve**{: data-type=\"term\"}, in which competing oligopoly firms commit to match price cuts, but not price increases. This situation is shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C10_007). Say that an oligopoly airline has agreed with the rest of a cartel to provide a quantity of 10,000 seats on the New York to Los Angeles route, at a price of $500. This choice defines the kink in the firm\u2019s perceived demand curve. The reason that the firm faces a kink in its demand curve is because of how the other oligopolists react to changes in the firm\u2019s price. If the oligopoly decides to produce more and cut its price, the other members of the cartel will immediately match any price cuts\u2014and therefore, a lower price brings very little increase in quantity sold.\n\nIf one **firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} cuts its price to $300, it will be able to sell only 11,000 seats. However, if the airline seeks to raise prices, the other oligopolists will not raise their prices, and so the firm that raised prices will lose a considerable share of sales. For example, if the firm raises its price to $550, its sales drop to 5,000 seats sold. Thus, if oligopolists always match price cuts by other firms in the cartel, but do not match price increases, then none of the oligopolists will have a strong incentive to change prices, since the potential gains are minimal. This strategy can work like a silent form of cooperation, in which the cartel successfully manages to hold down output, increase **price**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, and share a monopoly level of profits even without any legally enforceable agreement.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C10_007 data-title=\"A Kinked Demand Curve \"}\n\nMany real-world oligopolies, prodded by economic changes, legal and political pressures, and the egos of their top executives, go through episodes of cooperation and competition. If oligopolies could sustain cooperation with each other on output and pricing, they could earn profits as if they were a single monopoly. However, each firm in an oligopoly has an incentive to produce more and grab a bigger share of the overall market; when firms start behaving in this way, the market outcome in terms of prices and quantity can be similar to that of a highly competitive market.\n\n### Tradeoffs of Imperfect Competition\n\nMonopolistic competition is probably the single most common market structure in the U.S. economy. It provides powerful incentives for innovation, as firms seek to earn profits in the short run, while entry assures that firms do not earn economic profits in the long run. However, monopolistically competitive firms do not produce at the lowest point on their average cost curves. In addition, the endless search to impress consumers through product differentiation may lead to excessive social expenses on advertising and marketing.\n\nOligopoly is probably the second most common market structure. When oligopolies result from patented innovations or from taking advantage of economies of scale to produce at low average cost, they may provide considerable benefit to consumers. Oligopolies are often buffeted by significant barriers to entry, which enable the oligopolists to earn sustained profits over long periods of time. Oligopolists also do not typically produce at the minimum of their average cost curves. When they lack vibrant competition, they may lack incentives to provide innovative products and high-quality service.\n\nThe task of public policy with regard to competition is to sort through these multiple realities, attempting to encourage behavior that is beneficial to the broader society and to discourage behavior that only adds to the profits of a few large companies, with no corresponding benefit to consumers. [Monopoly and Antitrust Policy](/m48661){: .target-chapter} discusses the delicate judgments that go into this task.\n\n\n\nThe Temptation to Defy the Law\n\nOligopolistic firms have been called \u201ccats in a bag,\u201d as this chapter mentioned. The French detergent makers chose to \u201ccozy up\u201d with each other. The result? An uneasy and tenuous relationship. When the *Wall Street Journal* reported on the matter, it wrote: \u201cAccording to a statement a Henkel manager made to the \\[French anti-trust\\] commission, the detergent makers wanted \u2018to limit the intensity of the competition between them and clean up the market.\u2019 Nevertheless, by the early 1990s, a price war had broken out among them.\u201d During the soap executives\u2019 meetings, which sometimes lasted more than four hours, complex pricing structures were established. \u201cOne \\[soap\\] executive recalled \u2018chaotic\u2019 meetings as each side tried to work out how the other had bent the rules.\u201d Like many cartels, the soap cartel disintegrated due to the very strong temptation for each member to maximize its own individual profits.\n\nHow did this soap opera end? After an investigation, French antitrust authorities fined Colgate-Palmolive, Henkel, and Proctor &amp; Gamble a total of \u20ac361 million ($484 million). A similar fate befell the icemakers. Bagged ice is a commodity, a perfect substitute, generally sold in 7- or 22-pound bags. No one cares what label is on the bag. By agreeing to carve up the ice market, control broad geographic swaths of territory, and set prices, the icemakers moved from perfect competition to a monopoly model. After the agreements, each firm was the sole supplier of bagged ice to a region; there were profits in both the long run and the short run. According to the courts: \u201cThese companies illegally conspired to manipulate the marketplace.\u201d Fines totaled about $600,000\u2014a steep fine considering a bag of ice sells for under $3 in most parts of the United States.\n\nEven though it is illegal in many parts of the world for firms to set prices and carve up a market, the temptation to earn higher profits makes it extremely tempting to defy the law.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nAn oligopoly is a situation where a few firms sell most or all of the goods in a market. Oligopolists earn their highest profits if they can band together as a cartel and act like a monopolist by reducing output and raising price. Since each member of the oligopoly can benefit individually from expanding output, such collusion often breaks down\u2014especially since explicit collusion is illegal.\n\nThe prisoner\u2019s dilemma is an example of game theory. It shows how, in certain situations, all sides can benefit from cooperative behavior rather than self-interested behavior. However, the challenge for the parties is to find ways to encourage cooperative behavior.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nConsider the curve shown in [[link]](#CNX_Econ_C10_010), which shows the market demand, marginal cost, and marginal revenue curve for firms in an oligopolistic industry. In this example, we assume firms have zero fixed costs.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C10_010}\n\n\n1.  Suppose the firms collude to form a cartel. What price will the cartel charge? What quantity will the cartel supply? How much profit will the cartel earn?\n2.  Suppose now that the cartel breaks up and the oligopolistic firms compete as vigorously as possible by cutting the price and increasing sales. What will the industry quantity and price be? What will the collective profits be of all firms in the industry?\n3.  Compare the equilibrium price, quantity, and profit for the cartel and cutthroat competition outcomes.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  If the firms form a cartel, they will act like a monopoly, choosing the quantity of output where MR = MC. Drawing a line from the monopoly quantity up to the demand curve shows the monopoly price. Assuming that fixed costs are zero, and with an understanding of cost and profit, we can infer that when the marginal cost curve is horizontal, average cost is the same as marginal cost. Thus, the cartel will earn positive economic profits equal to the area of the rectangle, with a base equal to the monopoly quantity and a height equal to the difference between price (on the demand above the monopoly quantity) and average cost, as shown in the following figure. {: #CNX_Econ_C10_011}\n\n\n2.  The firms will expand output and cut price as long as there are profits remaining. The long-run equilibrium will occur at the point where average cost equals demand. As a result, the oligopoly will earn zero economic profits due to \u201ccutthroat competition,\u201d as shown in the next figure. {: #CNX_Econ_C10_012}\n\n\n3.  Pc &gt; Pcc. Qc &lt; Qcc. Profit for the cartel is positive and large. Profit for cutthroat competition is zero.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes oligopolies in the same industry are very different in size. Suppose we have a duopoly where one firm (Firm A) is large and the other firm (Firm B) is small, as shown in the prisoner\u2019s dilemma box in [[link]](#Table_10_05).\n\n<table id=\"Table_10_05\" summary=\"The table shows the prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma for a duopoly.

Since Firm A\u2019s profits will decline substantially, however, it is likely that Firm A will notice and if so, Firm A will cheat also, with the result that Firm B will lose 90% of what it gained by cheating. Firm A will reason that Firm B is unlikely to risk cheating. If neither firm cheats, Firm A earns $1000. If Firm A cheats, assuming Firm B does not cheat, A can boost its profits only a little, since Firm B is so small. If both firms cheat, then Firm A loses at least 50% of what it could have earned. The possibility of a small gain ($50) is probably not enough to induce Firm A to cheat, so in this case it is likely that both firms will collude.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWill the firms in an oligopoly act more like a monopoly or more like competitors?

Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat stops oligopolists from acting together as a monopolist and earning the highest possible level of profits?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWould you expect the kinked demand curve to be more extreme (like a right angle) or less extreme (like a normal demand curve) if each firm in the cartel produces a near-identical product like OPEC and petroleum? What if each firm produces a somewhat different product? Explain your reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen OPEC raised the price of oil dramatically in the mid-1970s, experts said it was unlikely that the cartel could stay together over the long term\u2014that the incentives for individual members to cheat would become too strong. More than forty years later, OPEC still exists. Why do you think OPEC has been able to beat the odds and continue to collude? *Hint:* You may wish to consider non-economic reasons.\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nMary and Raj are the only two growers who provide organically grown corn to a local grocery store.

You may even use natural gas for cooking. However, those uses are not the primary uses of natural gas in the U.S. In 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, home heating, cooling, and cooking accounted for just 18% of natural gas usage. What accounts for the rest? The greatest uses for natural gas are the generation of electric power (39%) and in industry (30%). Together these three uses for natural gas touch many areas of our lives, so why would there be any opposition to a merger of two natural gas firms? After all, a merger could mean increased efficiencies and reduced costs to people like you and me.\n\nIn October 2011, Kinder Morgan and El Paso Corporation, two natural gas firms, announced they were merging. The announcement stated the combined firm would link \u201cnearly every major production region with markets,\u201d cut costs by \u201celiminating duplication in pipelines and other assets,\u201d and that \u201cthe savings could be passed on to consumers.\u201d\n\nThe objection? The $21.1 billion deal would give Kinder Morgan control of more than 80,000 miles of pipeline, making the new firm the third largest energy producer in North America. As the third largest energy producer, policymakers and the public wondered whether the cost savings really would be passed on to consumers, or would the merger give Kinder Morgan a strong oligopoly position in the natural gas marketplace?\n\nThat brings us to the central question this chapter poses: What should the balance be between corporate size and a larger number of competitors in a marketplace? We will also consider what role the government should play in this balancing act.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Monopoly and Antitrust Policy\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Corporate Mergers\n* Regulating Anticompetitive Behavior\n* Regulating Natural Monopolies\n* The Great Deregulation Experiment\n\n\n\nThe previous chapters on the theory of the firm identified three important lessons: First, that competition, by providing consumers with lower prices and a variety of innovative products, is a good thing; second, that large-scale production can dramatically lower average costs; and third, that markets in the real world are rarely perfectly competitive. As a consequence, government policymakers must determine how much to intervene to balance the potential benefits of large-scale production against the potential loss of competition that can occur when businesses grow in size, especially through mergers.\n\nFor example, in 2011, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile proposed a merger. At the time, there were only four major mobile phone service providers. The proposal was blocked by both the Justice Department and the FCC.\n\nThe two companies argued that the merger would benefit consumers, who would be able to purchase better telecommunications services at a cheaper price because the newly created firm would be able to produce more efficiently by taking advantage of economies of scale and eliminating duplicate investments. However, a number of activist groups like the Consumer Federation of America and Public Knowledge expressed fears that the merger would reduce competition and lead to higher prices for consumers for decades to come. In December 2006, the federal government allowed the merger to proceed. By 2009, the new post-merger AT&amp;T was the eighth largest company by revenues in the United States, and by that measure the largest telecommunications company in the world. Economists have spent \u2013 and will still spend \u2013 years trying to determine whether the merger of AT&amp;T and BellSouth, as well as other smaller mergers of telecommunications companies at about this same time, helped consumers, hurt them, or did not make much difference.\n\nThis chapter discusses public policy issues about competition. How can economists and governments determine when mergers of large companies like AT&amp;T and BellSouth should be allowed and when they should be blocked? The government also plays a role in policing anticompetitive behavior other than mergers, like prohibiting certain kinds of contracts that might restrict competition. In the case of natural monopoly, however, trying to preserve competition probably will not work very well, and so government will often resort to regulation of price and/or quantity of output. In recent decades, there has been a global trend toward less government intervention in the price and output decisions of businesses.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

When one firm purchases another, it is called an **acquisition**{: data-type=\"term\"}. An acquisition may not look just like a merger, since the newly purchased firm may continue to be operated under its former company name. Mergers can also be lateral, where two firms of similar sizes combine to become one. However, both mergers and acquisitions lead to two formerly separate firms being under common ownership, and so they are commonly grouped together.\n\n### Regulations for Approving Mergers\n\nSince a merger combines two firms into one, it can reduce the extent of competition between firms. Therefore, when two U.S. firms announce a merger or acquisition where at least one of the firms is above a minimum size of sales (a threshold that moves up gradually over time, and was at $70.9 million in 2013), or certain other conditions are met, they are required under law to notify the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The left-hand panel of [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C11_004) (a) shows the number of mergers submitted for review to the FTC each year from 1999 to 2012. Mergers were very high in the late 1990s, diminished in the early 2000s, and then rebounded somewhat in a cyclical fashion. The right-hand panel of [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C11_004) (b) shows the distribution of those mergers submitted for review in 2012 as measured by the size of the transaction. It is important to remember that this total leaves out many small mergers under $50 million, which only need to be reported in certain limited circumstances. About a quarter of all reported merger and acquisition transactions in 2012 exceeded $500 million, while about 11 percent exceeded $1 billion. In 2014, the FTC took action against mergers likely to stifle competition in markets worth 18.6 billion in sales.\n\n The number of mergers in 1999 and 2000 were relatively high compared to the annual numbers seen from 2001&#x2013;2012. While 2001 and 2007 saw a high number of mergers, these were still only about half the number of mergers in 1999 and 2000. (b) In 2012, the greatest number of mergers submitted for review was for transactions between $100 and $150 million.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C11_004 data-title=\"Number and Size of Mergers \"}\n\nThe laws that give government the power to block certain mergers, and even in some cases to break up large firms into smaller ones, are called **antitrust laws**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Before a large merger happens, the antitrust regulators at the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice can allow the merger, prohibit it, or allow it if certain conditions are met. One common condition is that the merger will be allowed if the firm agrees to sell off certain parts. For example, in 2006, Johnson &amp; Johnson bought the Pfizer\u2019s \u201cconsumer health\u201d division, which included well-known brands like Listerine mouthwash and Sudafed cold medicine. As a condition of allowing the merger, Johnson &amp; Johnson was required to sell off six brands to other firms, including Zantac\u00ae heartburn relief medication, Cortizone anti-itch cream, and Balmex diaper rash medication, to preserve a greater degree of competition in these markets.\n\nThe U.S. government approves most proposed mergers. In a market-oriented economy, firms have the freedom to make their own choices. Private firms generally have the freedom to:\n\n* expand or reduce production\n* set the price they choose\n* open new factories or sales facilities or close them\n* hire workers or to lay them off\n* start selling new products or stop selling existing ones\n\nIf the owners want to acquire a firm or be acquired, or to merge with another firm, this decision is just one of many that firms are free to make. In these conditions, the managers of private firms will sometimes make mistakes. They may close down a factory which, it later turns out, would have been profitable. They may start selling a product that ends up losing money. A merger between two companies can sometimes lead to a clash of corporate personalities that makes both firms worse off. But the fundamental belief behind a market-oriented economy is that firms, not governments, are in the best position to know if their actions will lead to attracting more customers or producing more efficiently.\n\nIndeed, government regulators agree that most mergers are beneficial to consumers. As the Federal Trade Commission has noted on its website (as of November, 2013): \u201cMost mergers actually benefit competition and consumers by allowing firms to operate more efficiently.\u201d At the same time, the FTC recognizes, \u201cSome \\[mergers\\] are likely to lessen competition. That, in turn, can lead to higher prices, reduced availability of goods or services, lower quality of products, and less innovation. Indeed, some mergers create a concentrated market, while others enable a single firm to raise prices.\u201d The challenge for the antitrust regulators at the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice is to figure out when a merger may hinder competition. This decision involves both numerical tools and some judgments that are difficult to quantify. The following Clear it Up helps explain how antitrust laws came about.\n\n\n\nWhat is U.S. antitrust law?\n\nIn the closing decades of the 1800s, many industries in the U.S. economy were dominated by a single firm that had most of the sales for the entire country. Supporters of these large firms argued that they could take advantage of economies of scale and careful planning to provide consumers with products at low prices. However, critics pointed out that when competition was reduced, these firms were free to charge more and make permanently higher profits, and that without the goading of competition, it was not clear that they were as efficient or innovative as they could be.\n\nIn many cases, these large firms were organized in the legal form of a \u201ctrust,\u201d in which a group of formerly independent firms were consolidated together by mergers and purchases, and a group of \u201ctrustees\u201d then ran the companies as if they were a single firm. Thus, when the U.S. government passed the **Sherman Antitrust Act**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} in 1890 to limit the power of these trusts, it was called an antitrust law. In an early demonstration of the law\u2019s power, the U.S. Supreme Court in 1911 upheld the government\u2019s right to break up Standard Oil, which had controlled about 90% of the country\u2019s oil refining, into 34 independent firms, including Exxon, Mobil, Amoco, and Chevron. In 1914, the **Clayton Antitrust Act**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} outlawed mergers and acquisitions (where the outcome would be to \u201csubstantially lessen competition\u201d in an industry), price discrimination (where different customers are charged different prices for the same product), and tied sales (where purchase of one product commits the buyer to purchase some other product). Also in 1914, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was created to define more specifically what competition was unfair. In 1950, the **Celler-Kefauver Act**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} extended the Clayton Act by restricting vertical and conglomerate mergers. In the twenty-first century, the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice continue to enforce antitrust laws.\n\n\n\n### The Four-Firm Concentration Ratio\n\nRegulators have struggled for decades to measure the degree of monopoly power in an industry. An early tool was the **concentration ratio**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which measures what share of the total sales in the industry are accounted for by the largest firms, typically the top four to eight firms. For an explanation of how high market concentrations can create inefficiencies in an economy, refer to [Monopoly](/m48650){: .target-chapter}.\n\nSay that the market for replacing broken automobile windshields in a certain city has 18 firms with the market shares shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_11_01), where the **market share**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} is each firm\u2019s proportion of total sales in that market. The four-firm concentration ratio is calculated by adding the market shares of the four largest firms: in this case, 16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40. This concentration ratio would not be considered especially high, because the largest four firms have less than half the market.\n\n<table id=\"Table_11_01\" summary=\"This table shows the market shares in the market for replacing automobile windshields. The first column lists the various companies that make up the market: Smooth as Glass Repair Company (16% of the market), The Auto Glass Doctor Company (10% of the market), Your Car Shield Company (8% of the market), seven firms that each have 6% of the market (42% of the market combined), and eight firms that each have 3% of the market (24% of the market, combined). The four-firm concentration ratio is 16 plus 10 plus 8 plus 6, which equals 40.\"><caption><span data-type=\"title\">Calculating Concentration Ratios from Market Shares</span></caption><thead>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"2\" data-align=\"left\">If the market shares in the market for replacing automobile windshields are:</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Smooth as Glass Repair Company</td>\n<td>16% of the market</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>The Auto Glass Doctor Company</td>\n<td>10% of the market </td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Your Car Shield Company</td>\n<td>8% of the market</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Seven firms that each have 6% of the market</td>\n<td>42% of the market, combined</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Eight firms that each have 3% of the market</td>\n<td>24% of the market, combined</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" data-align=\"left\">Then the four-firm concentration ratio is 16 + 10 + 8 + 6 = 40.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\nThe concentration ratio approach can help to clarify some of the fuzziness over deciding when a merger might affect competition. For instance, if two of the smallest firms in the hypothetical market for repairing automobile windshields merged, the four-firm concentration ratio would not change\u2014which implies that there is not much worry that the degree of competition in the market has notably diminished. However, if the top two firms merged, then the four-firm concentration ratio would become 46 (that is, 26 + 8 + 6 + 6). While this concentration ratio is modestly higher, the four-firm concentration ratio would still be less than half, so such a proposed merger might barely raise an eyebrow among antitrust regulators.\n\n\nVisit this [ website][1] to read an article about Google\u2019s run-in with the FTC.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### The Herfindahl-Hirshman Index\n\nA four-firm concentration ratio is a simple tool, which may reveal only part of the story. For example, consider two industries that both have a four-firm concentration ratio of 80. However, in one industry five firms each control 20% of the market, while in the other industry, the top firm holds 77% of the market and all the other firms have 1% each. Although the four-firm concentration ratios are identical, it would be reasonable to worry more about the extent of competition in the second case\u2014where the largest firm is nearly a monopoly\u2014than in the first.\n\nAnother approach to measuring industry concentration that can distinguish between these two cases is called the **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The HHI, as it is often called, is calculated by summing the squares of the market share of each firm in the industry, as the following Work it Out shows.\n\n\n\nCalculating HHI\n\nStep 1. Calculate the HHI for a monopoly with a market share of 100%. Because there is only one firm, it has 100% market share. The HHI is 100<sup>2</sup> = 10,000.\n\nStep 2. For an extremely competitive industry, with dozens or hundreds of extremely small competitors, the value of the HHI might drop as low as 100 or even less. Calculate the HHI for an industry with 100 firms that each have 1% of the market. In this case, the HHI is 100(1<sup>2</sup>) = 100.\n\nStep 3. Calculate the HHI for the industry shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_11_01). In this case, the HHI is 16<sup>2</sup> + 10<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> + 7(6<sup>2</sup>) + 8(3<sup>2</sup>) = 744.\n\nStep 4. Note that the HHI gives greater weight to large firms.\n\nStep 5. Consider the example given earlier, comparing one industry where five firms each have 20% of the market with an industry where one firm has 77% and the other 23 firms have 1% each. The two industries have the same four-firm concentration ratio of 80. But the HHI for the first industry is 5(20<sup>2</sup>) = 2,000, while the HHI for the second industry is much higher at 77<sup>2</sup> + 23(1<sup>2</sup>) = 5,952.\n\nStep 6. Note that the near-monopolist in the second industry drives up the HHI measure of industrial concentration.\n\nStep 7. Review [\\[link\\]](#Table_11_02) which gives some examples of the four-firm concentration ratio and the HHI in various U.S. industries in 2009. (You can find market share data from multiple industry sources. Data in the table are from: Verizon (for wireless), *The Wall Street Journal* (for automobiles), IDC Worldwide (for computers) and the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (for airlines).)\n\n<table id=\"Table_11_02\" summary=\"This table lists the largest five U.S. companies in various industries and their four-firm ratio and HHI numbers.

If a merger would result in an HHI of more than 1,800, the FTC would probably challenge it. If a merger would result in an HHI between 1,000 and 1,800, then the FTC would scrutinize the plan and make a case-by-case decision. However, in the last several decades, the antitrust enforcement authorities have moved away from relying as heavily on measures of concentration ratios and HHIs to determine whether a merger will be allowed, and instead carried out more case-by-case analysis on the extent of competition in different industries.\n\n### New Directions for Antitrust\n\nBoth the four-firm concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman index share some weaknesses. First, they begin from the assumption that the \u201cmarket\u201d under discussion is well-defined, and the only question is measuring how sales are divided in that market. Second, they are based on an implicit assumption that competitive conditions across industries are similar enough that a broad measure of concentration in the market is enough to make a decision about the effects of a merger. These assumptions, however, are not always correct. In response to these two problems, the antitrust regulators have been changing their approach in the last decade or two.\n\nDefining a **market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} is often controversial. For example, Microsoft in the early 2000s had a dominant share of the software for computer operating systems. However, in the total market for all computer software and services, including everything from games to scientific programs, the Microsoft share was only about 14% in 2014. A narrowly defined market will tend to make concentration appear higher, while a broadly defined market will tend to make it appear smaller.\n\nThere are two especially important shifts affecting how markets are defined in recent decades: one centers on technology and the other centers on **globalization**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. In addition, these two shifts are interconnected. With the vast improvement in communications technologies, including the development of the Internet, a consumer can order books or pet supplies from all over the country or the world. As a result, the degree of competition many local retail businesses face has increased. The same effect may operate even more strongly in markets for business supplies, where so-called \u201cbusiness-to-business\u201d websites can allow buyers and suppliers from anywhere in the world to find each other.\n\nGlobalization has changed the boundaries of markets. As recently as the 1970s, it was common for measurements of concentration ratios and HHIs to stop at national borders. Now, many industries find that their competition comes from the global market. A few decades ago, three companies, General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, dominated the U.S. auto market. By 2014, however, these three firms were making less than half of U.S. auto sales, and facing competition from well-known car manufacturers such as Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi, and Mazda. When HHIs are calculated with a global perspective, concentration in most major industries\u2014including cars\u2014is lower than in a purely domestic context.\n\nBecause attempting to define a particular market can be difficult and controversial, the Federal Trade Commission has begun to look less at market share and more at the data on actual competition between businesses. For example, in February 2007, Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats Market announced that they wished to merge. These were the two largest companies in the market that the government defined as \u201cpremium natural and organic supermarket chains.\u201d However, one could also argue that they were two relatively small companies in the broader market for all stores that sell groceries or specialty food products.\n\nRather than relying on a market definition, the government antitrust regulators looked at detailed evidence on profits and prices for specific stores in different cities, both before and after other competitive stores entered or exited. Based on that evidence, the Federal Trade Commission decided to block the merger. After two years of legal battles, the merger was eventually allowed in 2009 under the conditions that Whole Foods sell off the Wild Oats brand name and a number of individual stores, to preserve competition in certain local markets. For more on the difficulties of defining markets, refer to [Monopoly](/m48650){: .target-chapter}.\n\nThis new approach to antitrust regulation involves detailed analysis of specific markets and companies, instead of defining a market and counting up total sales. A common starting point is for antitrust regulators to use statistical tools and real-world evidence to estimate the **demand curves**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} and **supply curves**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} faced by the firms that are proposing the merger. A second step is to specify how competition occurs in this specific industry. Some possibilities include competing to cut prices, to raise output, to build a brand name through advertising, and to build a reputation for good service or high quality. With these pieces of the puzzle in place, it is then possible to build a statistical model that estimates the likely outcome for consumers if the two firms are allowed to merge. Of course, these models do require some degree of subjective judgment, and so they can become the subject of legal disputes between the antitrust authorities and the companies that wish to merge.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA corporate merger involves two private firms joining together. An acquisition refers to one firm buying another firm. In either case, two formerly independent firms become one firm. Antitrust laws seek to ensure active competition in markets, sometimes by preventing large firms from forming through mergers and acquisitions, sometimes by regulating business practices that might restrict competition, and sometimes by breaking up large firms into smaller competitors.\n\nA four-firm concentration ratio is one way of measuring the extent of competition in a market. It is calculated by adding the market shares\u2014that is, the percentage of total sales\u2014of the four largest firms in the market. A Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is another way of measuring the extent of competition in a market. It is calculated by taking the market shares of all firms in the market, squaring them, and then summing the total.\n\nThe forces of globalization and new communications and information technology have increased the level of competition faced by many firms by increasing the amount of competition from other regions and countries.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIs it true that both the four-firm concentration ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index can be affected by a merger between two firms that are not already in the top four by size? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\nYes, it is true. The HHI example is easy enough: since the market shares of all firms are included in the HHI calculation, a merger between two of the firms will change the HHI. For the four-firm concentration ratio, it is quite possible that a merger between, say, the fifth and sixth largest firms in the market could create a new firm that is then ranked in the top four in the market. In this case, a merger of two firms, neither in the top four, would still change the four-firm concentration ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it true that the four-firm concentration ratio puts more emphasis on one or two very large firms, while the Herfindahl-Hirshman Index puts more emphasis on all the firms in the entire market? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\nNo, it is not true. The HHI includes the market shares of all firms in its calculation, but the squaring of the market shares has the effect of making the impact of the largest firms relatively bigger than in the 4-firm or 8-firm ratio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome years ago, two intercity bus companies, Greyhound Lines, Inc. and Trailways Transportation System, wanted to merge. One possible definition of the market in this case was \u201cthe market for intercity bus service.\u201d Another possible definition was \u201cthe market for intercity transportation, including personal cars, car rentals, passenger trains, and commuter air flights.\u201d Which definition do you think the bus companies preferred, and why?\n\n\n\nThe bus companies wanted the broader market definition (i.e., the second definition). If the narrow definition had been used, the combined bus companies would have had a near-monopoly on the market for intercity bus service. But they had only a sliver of the market for intercity transportation when everything else was included. The merger was allowed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of globalization and new information and communications technology, would you expect that the definitions of markets used by antitrust authorities will become broader or narrower?\n\n\n\nThe common expectation is that the definition of markets will become broader because of greater competition from faraway places. However, this broadening doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that antitrust authorities can relax. There is also a fear that companies with a local or national monopoly may use the new opportunities to extend their reach across national borders, and that it will be difficult for national authorities to respond.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is a corporate merger?

For example, it is illegal for competitors to form a cartel to collude to make pricing and output decisions, as if they were a monopoly firm. The Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice prohibit firms from agreeing to fix prices or output, rigging bids, or sharing or dividing markets by allocating customers, suppliers, territories, or lines of commerce.\n\nIn the late 1990s, for example, the antitrust regulators prosecuted an international cartel of vitamin manufacturers, including the Swiss firm Hoffman-La Roche, the German firm BASF, and the French firm Rhone-Poulenc. These firms reached agreements on how much to produce, how much to charge, and which firm would sell to which customers. The high-priced vitamins were then bought by firms like General Mills, Kellogg, Purina-Mills, and Proctor and Gamble, which pushed up the prices more. Hoffman-La Roche pleaded guilty in May 1999 and agreed both to pay a fine of $500 million and to have at least one top executive serve four months of jail time.\n\nUnder U.S. antitrust laws, monopoly itself is not illegal. If a firm has a monopoly because of a newly patented invention, for example, the law explicitly allows a firm to earn higher-than-normal profits for a time as a reward for innovation. If a firm achieves a large share of the market by producing a better product at a lower price, such behavior is not prohibited by antitrust law.\n\n### Restrictive Practices\n\nAntitrust law includes rules against **restrictive practices**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014practices that do not involve outright agreements to raise price or to reduce the quantity produced, but that might have the effect of reducing competition. Antitrust cases involving restrictive practices are often controversial, because they delve into specific contracts or agreements between firms that are allowed in some cases but not in others.\n\nFor example, if a product manufacturer is selling to a group of dealers who then sell to the general public it is illegal for the manufacturer to demand a **minimum resale price maintenance agreement**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which would require the dealers to sell for at least a certain minimum price. A minimum price contract is illegal because it would restrict competition among dealers. However, the manufacturer is legally allowed to \u201csuggest\u201d minimum prices and to stop selling to dealers who regularly undercut the suggested price. If you think this rule sounds like a fairly subtle distinction, you are right.\n\nAn **exclusive dealing**{: data-type=\"term\"} agreement between a manufacturer and a dealer can be legal or illegal. It is legal if the purpose of the contract is to encourage competition between dealers. For example, it is legal for the Ford Motor Company to sell its cars to only Ford dealers, for General Motors to sell to only GM dealers, and so on. However, exclusive deals may also limit competition. If one large retailer obtained the exclusive rights to be the sole distributor of televisions, computers, and audio equipment made by a number of companies, then this exclusive contract would have an anticompetitive effect on other retailers.\n\n**Tying sales**{: data-type=\"term\"} happen when a customer is required to buy one product only if the customer also buys a second product. Tying sales are controversial because they force consumers to purchase a product that they may not actually want or need. Further, the additional, required products are not necessarily advantageous to the customer. Suppose that to purchase a popular DVD, the store required that you also purchase a portable TV of a certain model. These products are only loosely related, thus there is no reason to make the purchase of one contingent on the other. Even if a customer was interested in a portable TV, the tying to a particular model prevents the customer from having the option of selecting one from the numerous types available in the market. A related, but not identical, concept is called **bundling**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where two or more products are sold as one. Bundling typically offers an advantage for the consumer by allowing them to acquire multiple products or services for a better price. For example, several cable companies allow customers to buy products like cable, internet, and a phone line through a special price available through bundling. Customers are also welcome to purchase these products separately, but the price of bundling is usually more appealing.\n\nIn some cases, tying sales and bundling can be viewed as anticompetitive. However, in other cases they may be legal and even common. It is common for people to purchase season tickets to a sports team or a set of concerts so that they can be guaranteed tickets to the few contests or shows that are most popular and likely to sell out. Computer software manufacturers may often bundle together a number of different programs, even when the buyer wants only a few of the programs. Think about the software that is included in a new computer purchase, for example.\n\nRecall from the chapter on [Monopoly](/m48650) that **predatory pricing**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} occurs when the existing firm (or firms) reacts to a new firm by dropping prices very low, until the new firm is driven out of the market, at which point the existing firm raises prices again. This pattern of pricing is aimed at deterring the entry of new firms into the market. But in practice, it can be hard to figure out when pricing should be considered predatory. Say that American Airlines is flying between two cities, and a new airline starts flying between the same two cities, at a lower price. If American Airlines cuts its price to match the new entrant, is this predatory pricing? Or is it just market competition at work? A commonly proposed rule is that if a firm is selling for less than its average variable cost\u2014that is, at a price where it should be shutting down\u2014then there is evidence for predatory pricing. But calculating in the real world what costs are variable and what costs are fixed is often not obvious, either.\n\nThe Microsoft antitrust case embodies many of these gray areas in restrictive practices, as the next Clear it Up shows.\n\n\n\nDid Microsoft<sup>\u00ae</sup> engage in anticompetitive and restrictive practices?\n\nThe most famous restrictive practices case of recent years was a series of lawsuits by the U.S. government against Microsoft\u2014lawsuits that were encouraged by some of Microsoft\u2019s competitors. All sides admitted that Microsoft\u2019s Windows program had a near-monopoly position in the market for the software used in general computer operating systems. All sides agreed that the software had many satisfied customers. All sides agreed that the capabilities of computer software that was compatible with Windows\u2014both software produced by Microsoft and that produced by other companies\u2014had expanded dramatically in the 1990s. Having a **monopoly**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} or a near-monopoly is not necessarily illegal in and of itself, but in cases where one company controls a great deal of the market, antitrust regulators look at any allegations of restrictive practices with special care.\n\nThe antitrust regulators argued that Microsoft had gone beyond profiting from its software innovations and its dominant position in the software market for operating systems, and had tried to use its market power in operating systems software to take over other parts of the software industry. For example, the government argued that Microsoft had engaged in an anticompetitive form of exclusive dealing by threatening computer makers that, if they did not leave another firm\u2019s software off their machines (specifically, Netscape\u2019s Internet browser), then Microsoft would not sell them its operating system software. Microsoft was accused by the government antitrust regulators of tying together its Windows operating system software, where it had a monopoly, with its Internet Explorer browser software, where it did not have a monopoly, and thus using this bundling as an anticompetitive tool. Microsoft was also accused of a form of predatory pricing; namely, giving away certain additional software products for free as part of Windows, as a way of driving out the competition from other makers of software.\n\nIn April 2000, a federal court held that Microsoft\u2019s behavior had crossed the line into unfair competition, and recommended that the company be broken into two competing firms. However, that penalty was overturned on appeal, and in November 2002 Microsoft reached a settlement with the government that it would end its restrictive practices.\n\n\n\nThe concept of restrictive practices is continually evolving, as firms seek new ways to earn profits and government regulators define what is permissible and what is not. A situation where the law is evolving and changing is always somewhat troublesome, since laws are most useful and fair when firms know what they are in advance. In addition, since the law is open to interpretation, competitors who are losing out in the market can accuse successful firms of anticompetitive restrictive practices, and try to win through government regulation what they have failed to accomplish in the market. Officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice are, of course, aware of these issues, but there is no easy way to resolve them.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nFirms are blocked by antitrust authorities from openly colluding to form a cartel that will reduce output and raise prices.

A natural monopoly poses a difficult challenge for competition policy, because the structure of costs and demand seems to make competition unlikely or costly. A **natural monopoly**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} arises when average costs are declining over the range of production that satisfies market demand. This typically happens when fixed costs are large relative to variable costs. As a result, one firm is able to supply the total quantity demanded in the market at lower cost than two or more firms\u2014so splitting up the natural monopoly would raise the average cost of production and force customers to pay more.\n\nPublic utilities, the companies that have traditionally provided water and electrical service across much of the United States, are leading examples of natural monopoly. It would make little sense to argue that a local water company should be broken up into several competing companies, each with its own separate set of pipes and water supplies. Installing four or five identical sets of pipes under a city, one for each water company, so that each household could choose its own water provider, would be terribly costly. The same argument applies to the idea of having many competing companies for delivering electricity to homes, each with its own set of wires. Before the advent of wireless phones, the argument also applied to the idea of many different phone companies, each with its own set of phone wires running through the neighborhood.\n\n### The Choices in Regulating a Natural Monopoly\n\nSo what then is the appropriate competition policy for a natural monopoly? [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C11_003) illustrates the case of natural monopoly, with a market demand curve that cuts through the downward-sloping portion of the **average cost curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis}. Points A, B, C, and F illustrate four of the main choices for regulation. [\\[link\\]](#Table_11_05) outlines the regulatory choices for dealing with a natural monopoly.\n\n  equals marginal costs (MC) and by then looking to the market demand curve to see what price to charge for this quantity. This monopoly will produce at point A, with a quantity of 4 and a price of 9.3. If antitrust regulators split this company exactly in half, then each half would produce at point B, with average costs of 9.75 and output of 2. The regulators might require the firm to produce where marginal cost crosses the market demand curve at point C. However, if the firm is required to produce at a quantity of 8 and sell at a price of 3.5, the firm will suffer from losses. The most likely choice is point F, where the firm is required to produce a quantity of 6 and charge a price of 6.5.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C11_003 data-title=\"Regulatory Choices in Dealing with Natural Monopoly \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_11_05\" summary=\"The table has 9 rows and 7 columns.

In this case, the monopoly will follow its normal approach to maximizing profits. It determines the quantity where MR = MC, which happens at point P at a quantity of 4. The firm then looks to point A on the demand curve to find that it can charge a price of 9.3 for that profit-maximizing quantity. Since the price is above the average cost curve, the natural monopoly would earn economic profits.\n\nA second outcome arises if antitrust authorities decide to divide the company, so that the new firms can compete. As a simple example, imagine that the company is cut in half. Thus, instead of one large firm producing a quantity of 4, two half-size firms each produce a quantity of 2. Because of the declining average cost curve (AC), the average cost of production for each of the half-size companies each producing 2, as shown at point B, would be 9.75, while the average cost of production for a larger firm producing 4 would only be 7.75. Thus, the economy would become less productively efficient, since the good is being produced at a higher average cost. In a situation with a downward-sloping average cost curve, two smaller firms will always have higher average costs of production than one larger firm for any quantity of total output. In addition, the antitrust authorities must worry that splitting the natural monopoly into pieces may be only the start of their problems. If one of the two firms grows larger than the other, it will have lower average costs and may be able to drive its competitor out of the market. Alternatively, two firms in a market may discover subtle ways of coordinating their behavior and keeping prices high. Either way, the result will not be the greater competition that was desired.\n\nA third alternative is that regulators may decide to set prices and quantities produced for this industry. The regulators will try to choose a point along the market demand curve that benefits both consumers and the broader social interest. Point C illustrates one tempting choice: the regulator requires that the firm produce the quantity of output where marginal cost crosses the demand curve at an output of 8, and charge the price of 3.5, which is equal to **marginal cost**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} at that point. This rule is appealing because it requires price to be set equal to marginal cost, which is what would occur in a perfectly competitive market, and it would assure consumers a higher quantity and lower price than at the monopoly choice A. In fact, efficient allocation of resources would occur at point C, since the value to the consumers of the last unit bought and sold in this market is equal to the marginal cost of producing it.\n\nAttempting to bring about point C through force of regulation, however, runs into a severe difficulty. At point C, with an output of 8, a price of 3.5 is below the average cost of production, which is 5.7, and so if the firm charges a price of 3.5, it will be suffering losses. Unless the regulators or the government offer the firm an ongoing public subsidy (and there are numerous political problems with that option), the firm will lose money and go out of business.\n\nPerhaps the most plausible option for the regulator is point F; that is, to set the price where AC crosses the demand curve at an output of 6 and a price of 6.5. This plan makes some sense at an intuitive level: let the natural monopoly charge enough to cover its average costs and earn a normal rate of profit, so that it can continue operating, but prevent the firm from raising prices and earning abnormally high monopoly profits, as it would at the monopoly choice A. Of course, determining this level of output and price with the political pressures, time constraints, and limited information of the real world is much harder than identifying the point on a graph. For more on the problems that can arise from a centrally determined price, see the discussion of price floors and price ceilings in [Demand and Supply](/m48628){: .target-chapter}.\n\n### Cost-Plus versus Price Cap Regulation\n\nIndeed, regulators of public utilities for many decades followed the general approach of attempting to choose a point like F in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C11_003). They calculated the average cost of production for the water or electricity companies, added in an amount for the normal rate of profit the firm should expect to earn, and set the price for consumers accordingly. This method was known as **cost-plus regulation**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nCost-plus regulation raises difficulties of its own. If producers are reimbursed for their costs, plus a bit more, then at a minimum, producers have less reason to be concerned with high costs\u2014because they can just pass them along in higher prices. Worse, firms under cost-plus regulation even have an incentive to generate high costs by building huge factories or employing lots of staff, because what they can charge is linked to the costs they incur.\n\nThus, in the 1980s and 1990s, some regulators of public utilities began to use **price cap regulation**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where the regulator sets a price that the firm can charge over the next few years. A common pattern was to require a price that declined slightly over time. If the firm can find ways of reducing its costs more quickly than the price caps, it can make a high level of profits. However, if the firm cannot keep up with the price caps or suffers bad luck in the market, it may suffer losses. A few years down the road, the regulators will then set a new series of price caps based on the firm\u2019s performance.\n\nPrice cap regulation requires delicacy. It will not work if the price regulators set the price cap unrealistically low. It may not work if the market changes dramatically so that the firm is doomed to incurring losses no matter what it does\u2014say, if energy prices rise dramatically on world markets, then the company selling natural gas or heating oil to homes may not be able to meet price caps that seemed reasonable a year or two ago. But if the regulators compare the prices with producers of the same good in other areas, they can, in effect, pressure a natural monopoly in one area to compete with the prices being charged in other areas. Moreover, the possibility of earning greater profits or experiencing losses\u2014instead of having an average rate of profit locked in every year by cost-plus regulation\u2014can provide the natural monopoly with incentives for efficiency and innovation.\n\nWith natural monopoly, market competition is unlikely to take root, so if consumers are not to suffer the high prices and restricted output of an unrestricted monopoly, government regulation will need to play a role. In attempting to design a system of price cap regulation with flexibility and incentive, government regulators do not have an easy task.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nIn the case of a natural monopoly, market competition will not work well and so, rather than allowing an unregulated monopoly to raise price and reduce output, the government may wish to regulate price and/or output. Common examples of regulation are public utilities, the regulated firms that often provide electricity and water service.\n\nCost-plus regulation refers to government regulation of a firm which sets the price that a firm can charge over a period of time by looking at the firm\u2019s accounting costs and then adding a normal rate of profit. Price cap regulation refers to government regulation of a firm where the government sets a price level several years in advance. In this case, the firm can either make high profits if it manages to produce at lower costs or sell a higher quantity than expected or suffer low profits or losses if costs are high or it sells less than expected.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nUrban transit systems, especially those with rail systems, typically experience significant economies of scale in operation.

In some cases, like water and electricity that have natural monopoly characteristics, there is some room in economic theory for such regulation. But once politicians are given a basis to intervene in markets and to choose prices and quantities, it is hard to know where to stop.\n\n### Doubts about Regulation of Prices and Quantities\n\nBeginning in the 1970s, it became clear to policymakers of all political leanings that the existing price regulation was not working well. The United States carried out a great policy experiment\u2014the **deregulation**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} discussed in [Monopoly](/m48650){: .target-chapter}\u2014removing government controls over prices and quantities produced in airlines, railroads, trucking, intercity bus travel, natural gas, and bank interest rates. The Clear it Up discusses the outcome of deregulation in one industry in particular\u2014airlines.\n\n\n\nWhat are the results of airline deregulation?\n\nWhy did the pendulum swing in favor of deregulation? Consider the airline industry. In the early days of air travel, no airline could make a profit just by flying passengers. Airlines needed something else to carry and the Postal Service provided that something with airmail. And so the first U.S. government regulation of the airline industry happened through the Postal Service, when in 1926 the Postmaster General began giving airlines permission to fly certain routes based on the needs of mail delivery\u2014and the airlines took some passengers along for the ride. In 1934, the Postmaster General was charged by the antitrust authorities with colluding with the major airlines of that day to monopolize the nation\u2019s airways. In 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) was created to regulate airfares and routes instead. For 40 years, from 1938 to 1978, the CAB approved all fares, controlled all entry and exit, and specified which airlines could fly which routes. There was zero entry of new airlines on the main routes across the country for 40 years, because the CAB did not think it was necessary.\n\nIn 1978, the Airline Deregulation Act took the government out of the business of determining airfares and schedules. The new law shook up the industry. Famous old airlines like Pan American, Eastern, and Braniff went bankrupt and disappeared. Some new airlines like People Express were created\u2014and then vanished.\n\nThe greater competition from deregulation reduced airfares by about one-third over the next two decades, saving consumers billions of dollars a year. The average flight used to take off with just half its seats full; now it is two-thirds full, which is far more efficient. Airlines have also developed hub-and-spoke systems, where planes all fly into a central hub city at a certain time and then depart. As a result, one can fly between any of the spoke cities with just one connection\u2014and there is greater service to more cities than before deregulation. With lower fares and more service, the number of air passengers doubled from the late 1970s to the start of the 2000s\u2014an increase that, in turn, doubled the number of jobs in the airline industry. Meanwhile, with the watchful oversight of government safety inspectors, commercial air travel has continued to get safer over time.\n\nThe U.S. airline industry is far from perfect. For example, a string of mergers in recent years has raised concerns over how competition might be compromised.\n\n\n\nOne difficulty with government price regulation is what economists call **regulatory capture**{: data-type=\"term\"}, in which the firms supposedly being regulated end up playing a large role in setting the regulations that they will follow. When the airline industry was being regulated, for example, it suggested appointees to the regulatory board, sent lobbyists to argue with the board, provided most of the information on which the board made decisions, and offered well-paid jobs to at least some of the people leaving the board. In this situation, consumers can easily end up being not very well represented by the regulators. The result of regulatory capture is that government price regulation can often become a way for existing competitors to work together to reduce output, keep prices high, and limit competition.\n\n### The Effects of Deregulation\n\nDeregulation, both of airlines and of other industries, has its negatives. The greater pressure of competition led to entry and exit. When firms went bankrupt or contracted substantially in size, they laid off workers who had to find other jobs. Market competition is, after all, a full-contact sport.\n\nA number of major accounting scandals involving prominent corporations such as Enron, Tyco International, and WorldCom led to the **Sarbanes-Oxley Act**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis} in 2002. Sarbanes-Oxley was designed to increase confidence in financial information provided by public corporations to protect investors from accounting fraud.\n\nThe Great Recession which began in late 2007 and which the U.S. economy is still struggling to recover from was caused at least in part by a global financial crisis, which began in the United States. The key component of the crisis was the creation and subsequent failure of several types of unregulated financial assets, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs, a type of mortgage-backed security), and credit default swaps (CDSs, insurance contracts on assets like CMOs that provided a payoff even if the holder of the CDS did not own the CMO). Many of these assets were rated very safe by private credit rating agencies such as Standard &amp; Poors, Moody\u2019s, and Fitch.\n\nThe collapse of the markets for these assets precipitated the financial crisis and led to the failure of Lehman Brothers, a major investment bank, numerous large commercial banks, such as Wachovia, and even the Federal National Mortgage Corporation (Fannie Mae), which had to be nationalized\u2014that is, taken over by the federal government. One response to the financial crisis was the **Dodd-Frank Act**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis}, which attempted major reforms of the financial system. The legislation\u2019s purpose, as noted on dodd-frank.com is:\n\n<q>To promote the financial stability of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end \u201ctoo big to fail,\u201d to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, \\[and\\] to protect consumers from abusive financial services practices. . . </q>\n\nWe will explore the financial crisis and the Great Recession in more detail in the macroeconomic chapters of this book, but for now it should be clear that many Americans have grown disenchanted with deregulation, at least of financial markets.\n\nAll market-based economies operate against a background of laws and regulations, including laws about enforcing contracts, collecting taxes, and protecting health and the environment. The government policies discussed in this chapter\u2014like blocking certain anticompetitive mergers, ending restrictive practices, imposing price cap regulation on natural monopolies, and deregulation\u2014demonstrate the role of government to strengthen the incentives that come with a greater degree of competition.\n\n\n\nMore than Cooking, Heating, and Cooling\n\nWhat did the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) decide on the Kinder Morgan / El Paso Corporation merger? After careful examination, federal officials decided there was only one area of significant overlap that might provide the merged firm with strong market power. The FTC approved the merger, provided Kinder Morgan divest itself of the overlap area. Tallgrass purchased Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission, Trailblazer Pipeline Co. LLC, two processing facilities in Wyoming, and Kinder Morgan\u2019s 50 percent interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline to meet the FTC requirements. The FTC was attempting to strike a balance between potential cost reductions resulting from economies of scale and concentration of market power.\n\nDid the price of natural gas decrease? Yes, rather significantly. In 2010, the wellhead price of natural gas was $4.48 per thousand cubic foot; in 2012 the price had fallen to just $2.66. Was the merger responsible for the large drop in price? The answer is uncertain. The larger contributor to the sharp drop in price was the overall increase in the supply of natural gas. More and more natural gas was able to be recovered by fracturing shale deposits, a process called fracking. Fracking, which is controversial for environmental reasons, enabled the recovery of known reserves of natural gas that previously were not economically feasible to tap. Kinder Morgan\u2019s control of 80,000-plus miles of pipeline likely made moving the gas from wellheads to end users smoother and allowed for an even greater benefit from the increased supply.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe U.S. economy experienced a wave of deregulation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when a number of government regulations that had set prices and quantities produced in a number of industries were eliminated. Major accounting scandals in the early 2000s and, more recently, the Great Recession have spurred new regulation to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Regulatory capture occurs when the industries being regulated end up having a strong influence over what regulations exist.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\nUse the following information to answer the next three questions. In the years before wireless phones, when telephone technology required having a wire running to every home, it seemed plausible that telephone service had diminishing average costs and might need to be regulated like a natural monopoly. For most of the twentieth century, the national U.S. phone company was AT&amp;T, and the company functioned as a regulated monopoly. Think about the deregulation of the U.S. telecommunications industry that has happened over the last few decades. (This is not a research assignment, but a thought assignment based on what you have learned in this chapter.)\n\n\n\nWhat real world changes made the deregulation possible?\n\n\n\nImprovements in technology that allowed phone calls to be made via microwave transmission, communications satellites, and other wireless technologies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the benefits of the deregulation?\n\n\n\nMore consumer choice. Cheaper phone calls, especially long distance. Better-quality phone service in many cases. Cheaper, faster, and better-quality data transmission. Spin-off technologies like free Internet-based calling and video calling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat might some of the negatives of deregulation be?\n\n\n\nMore choice can sometimes make for difficult decisions\u2014not knowing if you got the best plan for your situation, for example. Some phone service providers are less reliable than AT&amp;T used to be.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is deregulation?

It is a pipeline system designed to bring oil from Canada to the refineries near the Gulf of Mexico, as well as to boost crude oil production in the United States. While a private company, TransCanada, will own the pipeline, U.S. government approval is required because of its size and location. The pipeline is being built in four phases, with the first two currently in operation, bringing oil from Alberta, Canada, east across Canada, south through the United States into Nebraska and Oklahoma, and northeast again to Illinois. The third and fourth phases of the project, known as Keystone XL, would create a pipeline southeast from Alberta straight to Nebraska, and then from Oklahoma to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSounds like a great idea, right? A pipeline that would move much needed crude oil to the Gulf refineries would increase oil production for manufacturing needs, reduce price pressure at the gas pump, and increase overall economic growth. Supporters argue that the pipeline is one of the safest pipelines built yet, and would reduce America\u2019s dependence on politically vulnerable Middle Eastern oil imports.\n\nNot so fast, say its critics. The Keystone XL would be constructed over an enormous aquifer (one of the largest in the world) in the Midwest, and through an environmentally fragile area in Nebraska, causing great concern among environmentalists about possible destruction to the natural surroundings. They argue that leaks could taint valuable water sources and construction of the pipeline could disrupt and even harm indigenous species. Environmentalist groups have fought government approval of the proposed construction of the pipeline, and as of press time the pipeline projects remain stalled.\n\nOf course, environmental concerns matter when discussing issues related to economic growth. But how much should they factor in? In the case of the pipeline, how do we know how much damage it would cause when we do not know how to put a value on the environment? Would the benefits of the pipeline outweigh the opportunity cost? The issue of how to balance economic progress with unintended effects on our planet is the subject of this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* The Economics of Pollution\n* Command-and-Control Regulation\n* Market-Oriented Environmental Tools\n* The Benefits and Costs of U.S. Environmental Laws\n* International Environmental Issues\n* The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection\n\n\n\nIn 1969, the Cuyahoga River in Ohio was so polluted that it spontaneously burst into flame. Air pollution was so bad at that time that Chattanooga, Tennessee was a city where, as an article from Sports Illustrated put it: \u201cthe death rate from tuberculosis was double that of the rest of Tennessee and triple that of the rest of the United States, a city in which the filth in the air was so bad it melted nylon stockings off women\u2019s legs, in which executives kept supplies of clean white shirts in their offices so they could change when a shirt became too gray to be presentable, in which headlights were turned on at high noon because the sun was eclipsed by the gunk in the sky.\u201d\n\nThe problem of pollution arises for every economy in the world, whether high-income or low-income, and whether market-oriented or command-oriented. Every country needs to strike some balance between production and environmental quality. This chapter begins by discussing how firms may fail to take certain social costs, like pollution, into their planning if they do not need to pay these costs. Traditionally, policies for environmental protection have focused on governmental limits on how much of each pollutant could be emitted. While this approach has had some success, economists have suggested a range of more flexible, market-oriented policies that reduce pollution at a lower cost. We will consider both approaches, but first let\u2019s see how economists frame and analyze these issues.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

Since the 1970s, however, the United States, using a variety of anti-pollution policies, has made genuine progress against a number of pollutants. [\\[link\\]](#Table_12_01) lists the change in carbon dioxide emissions by users of energy (from residential to industrial) according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The table shows that emissions of certain key air pollutants declined substantially from 2007 to 2012; they dropped 730 million metric tons (MMT) a year\u2014a 12% reduction. This seems to indicate that progress has been made in the United States in reducing overall carbon dioxide emissions, which cause greenhouse gases.\n\n<table id=\"Table_12_01\" summary=\"The table has 6 rows of data, each representing a sector (Residential, Commercial, Industrial, Transportation, Power, and the change from 2007 to 2012).

Along with the still high levels of air and water pollution, other issues include hazardous waste disposal, destruction of wetlands and other wildlife habitats, and the impact on human health from pollution.\n\n### Externalities\n\n**Private markets**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, such as the cell phone industry, offer an efficient way to put buyers and sellers together and determine what goods are produced, how they are produced, and who gets them. The principle that voluntary exchange benefits both buyers and sellers is a fundamental building block of the economic way of thinking. But what happens when a voluntary exchange affects a third party who is neither the buyer nor the seller?\n\nAs an example, consider a concert producer who wants to build an outdoor arena that will host country music concerts a half-mile from your neighborhood. You will be able to hear these outdoor concerts while sitting on your back porch\u2014or perhaps even in your dining room. In this case, the sellers and buyers of concert tickets may both be quite satisfied with their voluntary exchange, but you have no voice in their market transaction. The effect of a market exchange on a third party who is outside or \u201cexternal\u201d to the exchange is called an **externality**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Because externalities that occur in market transactions affect other parties beyond those involved, they are sometimes called **spillovers**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nExternalities can be negative or positive. If you hate country music, then having it waft into your house every night would be a **negative externality**{: data-type=\"term\"}. If you love country music, then what amounts to a series of free concerts would be a **positive externality**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\n### Pollution as a Negative Externality\n\nPollution is a negative externality. Economists illustrate the **social costs**{: data-type=\"term\"} of production with a demand and supply diagram. The social costs include the private costs of production incurred by the company and the external costs of pollution that are passed on to society.

The market equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>), where quantity supplied and quantity demanded are equal, is at a price of $650 and a quantity of 45,000.

Let\u2019s say that, if these pollutants were emitted into the air and water, they would create costs of $100 per refrigerator produced. These costs might occur because of injuries to human health, property values, wildlife habitat, reduction of recreation possibilities, or because of other negative impacts. In a market with no anti-pollution restrictions, firms can dispose of certain wastes absolutely free. Now imagine that firms which produce refrigerators must factor in these **external costs**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of pollution\u2014that is, the firms have to consider not only the costs of labor and materials needed to make a refrigerator, but also the broader costs to society of injuries to health and other values caused by pollution. If the firm is required to pay $100 for the **additional external costs**{: data-type=\"term\"} of pollution each time it produces a refrigerator, production becomes more costly and the entire supply curve shifts up by $100.\n\nAs illustrated in the fourth column of [\\[link\\]](#Table_12_02) and in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C12_001), the firm will need to receive a price of $700 per refrigerator and produce a quantity of 40,000\u2014and the firm\u2019s new supply curve will be S<sub>social</sub>. The new equilibrium will occur at E<sub>1</sub>, taking the additional external costs of pollution into account results in a higher price, a lower quantity of production, and a lower quantity of pollution. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through an example, this time with musical accompaniment.\n\n\n\nIdentifying the Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_12_03) shows the supply and demand conditions for a firm that will play trumpets on the streets when requested.

Determine the negative externality in this situation. To do this, you must think about the situation described and consider all parties that might be impacted. A negative externality might be the increase in noise pollution in the area where the firm is playing.\n\nStep 2. Identify the equilibrium price and quantity when only private costs are taken into account, and then when social costs are taken into account. Remember that equilibrium is where the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied.\n\nStep 3. Look down the columns to where the quantity demanded (the second column) is equal to the \u201cquantity supplied without paying the costs of the externality\u201d (the third column). Then refer to the first column of that row to determine the equilibrium price. In this case, the equilibrium price and quantity when only private costs are taken into account would be at a price of $10 and a quantity of five.\n\nStep 4. Identify the equilibrium price and quantity when the additional external costs are taken into account. Look down the columns of quantity demanded (the second column) and the \u201cquantity supplied after paying the costs of the externality\u201d (the fourth column) then refer to the first column of that row to determine the equilibrium price. In this case, the equilibrium will be at a price of $12 and a quantity of four.\n\nStep 5. Consider how taking the externality into account affects the equilibrium price and quantity. Do this by comparing the two equilibrium situations. If the firm is forced to pay its additional external costs, then production of trumpet songs becomes more costly, and the supply curve will shift up.\n\n\n\nRemember that the supply curve is based on choices about production that firms make while looking at their marginal costs, while the demand curve is based on the benefits that individuals perceive while maximizing utility. If no externalities existed, private costs would be the same as the costs to society as a whole, and private benefits would be the same as the benefits to society as a whole. Thus, if no externalities existed, the interaction of demand and supply will coordinate social costs and benefits.\n\nHowever, when the externality of pollution exists, the supply curve no longer represents all social costs. Because externalities represent a case where markets no longer consider all social costs, but only some of them, economists commonly refer to externalities as an example of **market failure**{: data-type=\"term\"}. When there is market failure, the private market fails to achieve efficient output, because either firms do not account for all costs incurred in the production of output and/or consumers do not account for all benefits obtained (a positive externality). In the case of pollution, at the market output, social costs of production exceed social benefits to consumers, and the market produces too much of the product.\n\nWe can see a general lesson here. If firms were required to pay the social costs of pollution, they would create less pollution but produce less of the product and charge a higher price. In the next module, we will explore how governments require firms to take the social costs of pollution into account.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nEconomic production can cause environmental damage. This tradeoff arises for all countries, whether high-income or low-income, and whether their economies are market-oriented or command-oriented.\n\nAn externality occurs when an exchange between a buyer and seller has an impact on a third party who is not part of the exchange. An externality, which is sometimes also called a spillover, can have a negative or a positive impact on the third party. If those parties imposing a negative externality on others had to take the broader social cost of their behavior into account, they would have an incentive to reduce the production of whatever is causing the negative externality. In the case of a positive externality, the third party is obtaining benefits from the exchange between a buyer and a seller, but they are not paying for these benefits. If this is the case, then markets would tend to under produce output because suppliers are not aware of the additional demand from others. If the parties that are generating benefits to others would be somehow compensated for these external benefits, they would have an incentive to increase production of whatever is causing the positive externality.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIdentify the following situations as an example of a negative or a positive externality:\n\n1.

Other laws required the installation of certain equipment\u2014for example, on automobile tailpipes or on smokestacks\u2014to reduce pollution. These types of laws, which specify allowable quantities of pollution and which also may detail which pollution-control technologies must be used, fall under the category of **command-and-control regulation**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In effect, command-and-control regulation requires that firms increase their costs by installing anti-pollution equipment; firms are thus required to take the social costs of pollution into account.\n\nCommand-and-control regulation has been highly successful in protecting and cleaning up the U.S. environment. In 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was created to oversee all environmental laws. In the same year, the **Clean Air Act**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} was enacted to address air pollution. Just two years later, in 1972, Congress passed and the president signed the far-reaching **Clean Water Act**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. These command-and-control environmental laws, and their amendments and updates, have been largely responsible for America\u2019s cleaner air and water in recent decades. However, economists have pointed out three difficulties with command-and-control environmental regulation.\n\nFirst, command-and-control regulation offers no incentive to improve the quality of the environment beyond the standard set by a particular law. Once the command-and-control regulation has been satisfied, polluters have zero incentive to do better.\n\nSecond, command-and-control regulation is inflexible. It usually requires the same standard for all polluters, and often the same pollution-control technology as well. This means that command-and-control regulation draws no distinctions between firms that would find it easy and inexpensive to meet the pollution standard\u2014or to reduce pollution even further\u2014and firms that might find it difficult and costly to meet the standard. Firms have no reason to rethink their production methods in fundamental ways that might reduce pollution even more and at lower cost.\n\nThird, command-and-control regulations are written by legislators and the EPA, and so they are subject to compromises in the political process. Existing firms often argue (and lobby) that stricter environmental standards should not apply to them, only to new firms that wish to start production. Consequently, real-world environmental laws are full of fine print, loopholes, and exceptions.\n\nAlthough critics accept the goal of reducing pollution, they question whether command-and-control regulation is the best way to design policy tools for accomplishing that goal. A different approach is the use of market-oriented tools, which are discussed in the next section.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nCommand-and-control regulation sets specific limits for pollution emissions and/or specific pollution-control technologies that must be used. Although such regulations have helped to protect the environment, they have three shortcomings: they provide no incentive for going beyond the limits they set; they offer limited flexibility on where and how to reduce pollution; and they often have politically-motivated loopholes.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nConsider two approaches to reducing emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> into the environment from manufacturing industries in the United States. In the first approach, the U.S. government makes it a policy to use only predetermined technologies. In the second approach, the U.S. government determines which technologies are cleaner and subsidizes their use. Of the two approaches, which is the command-and-control policy?\n\n\n\nThe first policy is command-and-control because it is a requirement that applies to all producers.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is command-and-control environmental regulation?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the three problems that economists have noted with regard to command-and-control regulation?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWould environmentalists favor command-and-control policies as a way to reduce pollution? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider two ways of protecting elephants from poachers in African countries. In one approach, the government sets up enormous national parks that have sufficient habitat for elephants to thrive and forbids all local people to enter the parks or to injure either the elephants or their habitat in any way. In a second approach, the government sets up national parks and designates 10 villages around the edges of the park as official tourist centers that become places where tourists can stay and bases for guided tours inside the national park. Consider the different incentives of local villagers\u2014who often are very poor\u2014in each of these plans. Which plan seems more likely to help the elephant population?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\ncommand-and-control regulation\n: laws that specify allowable quantities of pollution and that also may detail which pollution-control technologies must be used", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48671", "module_title": "Economics - m48671", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48671", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Show how pollution charges impact firm decisions\n* Suggest other laws and regulations that could fall under pollution charges\n* Explain the significance of marketable permits and property rights\n* Evaluate which policies are most appropriate for various situations\n\n\n\nMarket-oriented environmental policies create incentives to allow firms some flexibility in reducing pollution. The three main categories of market-oriented approaches to pollution control are pollution charges, marketable permits, and better-defined property rights. All of these policy tools, discussed below, address the shortcomings of command-and-control regulation\u2014albeit in different ways.\n\n### Pollution Charges\n\nA **pollution charge**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a tax imposed on the quantity of pollution that a firm emits. A pollution charge gives a profit-maximizing firm an incentive to figure out ways to reduce its emissions\u2014as long as the marginal cost of reducing the emissions is less than the tax.\n\nFor example, consider a small firm that emits 50 pounds per year of small particles, such as soot, into the air. Particulate matter, as it is called, causes respiratory illnesses and also imposes costs on firms and individuals.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C12_002) illustrates the marginal costs that a firm faces in reducing pollution. The marginal cost of pollution reduction, like most most **marginal cost curves**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} increases with output, at least in the short run. Reducing the first 10 pounds of particulate emissions costs the firm $300. Reducing the second 10 pounds would cost $500; reducing the third ten pounds would cost $900; reducing the fourth 10 pounds would cost $1,500; and the fifth 10 pounds would cost $2,500. This pattern for the costs of reducing pollution is common, because the firm can use the cheapest and easiest method to make initial reductions in pollution, but additional reductions in pollution become more expensive.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C12_002 data-title=\"A Pollution Charge \"}\n\nImagine the firm now faces a pollution tax of $1,000 for every 10 pounds of particulates emitted. The firm has the choice of either polluting and paying the tax, or reducing the amount of particulates they emit and paying the cost of abatement as shown in the figure. How much will the firm pollute and how much will the firm abate? The first 10 pounds would cost the firm $300 to abate. This is substantially less than the $1,000 tax, so they will choose to abate. The second 10 pounds would cost $500 to abate, which is still less than the tax, so they will choose to abate. The third 10 pounds would cost $900 to abate, which is slightly less than the $1,000 tax. The fourth 10 pounds would cost $1,500, which is much more costly than paying the tax. As a result, the firm will decide to reduce pollutants by 30 pounds, because the marginal cost of reducing pollution by this amount is less than the pollution tax. With a tax of $1,000, the firm has no incentive to reduce pollution more than 30 pounds.\n\nA firm that has to pay a pollution tax will have an incentive to figure out the least expensive technologies for reducing pollution. Firms that can reduce pollution cheaply and easily will do so to minimize their pollution taxes, whereas firms that will incur high costs for reducing pollution will end up paying the pollution tax instead. If the pollution tax applies to every source of pollution, then no special favoritism or loopholes are created for politically well-connected producers.\n\nFor an example of a pollution charge at the household level, consider two ways of charging for garbage collection. One method is to have a flat fee per household, no matter how much garbage a household produces. An alternative approach is to have several levels of fees, depending on how much garbage the household produces\u2014and to offer lower or free charges for recyclable materials. As of 2006 (latest statistics available), the EPA had recorded over 7,000 communities that have implemented \u201cpay as you throw\u201d programs. When people have a financial incentive to put out less garbage and to increase recycling, they find ways of doing so.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to learn more about pay-as-you-throw programs, including viewing a map and a table that shows the number of communities using this program in each state.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nA number of environmental policies are really pollution charges, although they often do not travel under that name. For example, the federal government and many state governments impose taxes on gasoline. We can view this tax as a charge on the air pollution that cars generate as well as a source of funding for maintaining roads. Indeed, gasoline taxes are far higher in most other countries than in the United States.\n\nSimilarly, the refundable charge of five or 10 cents that only 10 states have for returning recyclable cans and bottles works like a pollution tax that provides an incentive to avoid littering or throwing bottles in the trash. Compared with command-and-control regulation, a pollution tax reduces pollution in a more flexible and cost-effective way.\n\n\nVisit this [website][2] to see the current U.S. states with bottle bills and the states that have active campaigns for new bottle bills. You can also view current and proposed bills in Canada and other countries around the world.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Marketable Permits\n\nWhen a city or state government sets up a **marketable permit program**{: data-type=\"term\"} (e.g. cap-and-trade), it must start by determining the overall quantity of pollution it will allow as it tries to meet national pollution standards. Then, a number of permits allowing only this quantity of pollution are divided among the firms that emit that pollutant. These permits to pollute can be sold or given to firms free.\n\nNow, add two more conditions. Imagine that these permits are designed to reduce total emissions over time. For example, a permit may allow emission of 10 units of pollution one year, but only nine units the next year, then eight units the year after that, and so on down to some lower level. In addition, imagine that these are marketable permits, meaning that firms can buy and sell them.\n\nTo see how marketable permits can work to reduce pollution, consider the four firms listed in [\\[link\\]](#Table_12_06). The table shows current emissions of lead from each firm. At the start of the marketable permit program, each firm receives permits to allow this level of pollution. However, these permits are shrinkable, and next year the permits allow the firms to emit only half as much pollution. Let\u2019s say that in a year, Firm Gamma finds it easy and cheap to reduce emissions from 600 tons of lead to 200 tons, which means that it has permits that it is not using that allow emitting 100 tons of lead. Firm Beta reduces its lead pollution from 400 tons to 200 tons, so it does not need to buy any permits, and it does not have any extra permits to sell. However, although Firm Alpha can easily reduce pollution from 200 tons to 150 tons, it finds that it is cheaper to purchase permits from Gamma rather than to reduce its own emissions to 100. Meanwhile, Firm Delta did not even exist in the first period, so the only way it can start production is to purchase permits to emit 50 tons of lead.\n\nThe total quantity of pollution will decline. But the buying and selling of the marketable permits will determine exactly which firms reduce pollution and by how much. With a system of marketable permits, the firms that find it least expensive to do so will reduce pollution the most.\n\n<table id=\"Table_12_06\" summary=\"The table has 5 columns and 4 rows of data. The header row 1 lists the four firms: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta. The data is as follows:  &#10;Row 2: Current emissions--permits distributed free for this amount: Alpha = 200 tons, Beta = 400 tons, Gamma = 600 tons, Delta = 0 tons.  &#10;Row 3: How much pollution will these permits allow in one year?

The revised law sought to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants to half of the 1980 levels out of concern that sulfur dioxide was causing acid rain, which harms forests as well as buildings. In this case, the marketable permits the federal government issued were free of charge (no pun intended) to electricity-generating plants across the country, especially those that were burning coal (which produces sulfur dioxide). These permits were of the \u201cshrinkable\u201d type; that is, the amount of pollution allowed by a given permit declined with time.\n\n### Better-Defined Property Rights\n\nA clarified and strengthened idea of property rights can also strike a balance between economic activity and pollution. Ronald Coase (1910\u20132013), who won the 1991 Nobel Prize in economics, offered a vivid illustration of an externality: a railroad track running beside a farmer\u2019s field where the railroad locomotive sometimes gives off sparks and sets the field ablaze. Coase asked whose responsibility it was to address this spillover. Should the farmer be required to build a tall fence alongside the field to block the sparks? Or should the railroad be required to put some gadget on the locomotive\u2019s smokestack to reduce the number of sparks?\n\nCoase pointed out that this issue cannot be resolved until **property rights**{: data-type=\"term\"} are clearly defined\u2014that is, the legal rights of ownership on which others are not allowed to infringe without paying compensation. Does the farmer have a property right not to have a field burned? Does the railroad have a property right to run its own trains on its own tracks? If neither party has a property right, then the two sides may squabble endlessly, nothing will be done, and sparks will continue to set the field aflame. However, if either the farmer or the railroad has a well-defined legal responsibility, then that party will seek out and pay for the least costly method of reducing the risk that sparks will hit the field. The property right determines whether the farmer or the railroad pays the bills.\n\nThe property rights approach is highly relevant in cases involving endangered species. The U.S. government\u2019s endangered species list includes about 1,000 plants and animals, and about 90% of these species live on privately owned land. The protection of these endangered species requires careful thinking about incentives and property rights. The discovery of an endangered species on private land has often triggered an automatic reaction from the government to prohibit the landowner from using that land for any purpose that might disturb the imperiled creatures. Consider the incentives of that policy: If you admit to the government that you have an endangered species, the government effectively prohibits you from using your land. As a result, rumors abounded of landowners who followed a policy of \u201cshoot, shovel, and shut up\u201d when they found an endangered animal on their land. Other landowners have deliberately cut trees or managed land in a way that they knew would discourage endangered animals from locating there.\n\n\n\nHow effective are market-oriented environmental policy tools?\n\nEnvironmentalists sometimes fear that market-oriented environmental tools are an excuse to weaken or eliminate strict limits on pollution emissions and instead to allow more pollution. It is true that if pollution charges are set very low or if marketable permits do not reduce pollution by very much then market-oriented tools will not work well. But command-and-control environmental laws can also be full of loopholes or have exemptions that do not reduce pollution by much, either. The advantage of market-oriented environmental tools is not that they reduce pollution by more or less, but because of their incentives and flexibility, they can achieve any desired reduction in pollution at a lower cost to society.\n\n\n\nA more productive policy would consider how to provide private landowners with an incentive to protect the endangered species that they find and to provide a habitat for additional endangered species. For example, the government might pay landowners who provide and maintain suitable habitats for endangered species or who restrict the use of their land to protect an endangered species. Again, an environmental law built on incentives and flexibility offers greater promise than a command-and-control approach, which tries to oversee millions of acres of privately owned land.\n\n### Applying Market-Oriented Environmental Tools\n\nMarket-oriented environmental policies are a tool kit. Specific policy tools will work better in some situations than in others. For example, marketable permits work best when a few dozen or a few hundred parties are highly interested in trading, as in the cases of oil refineries that trade lead permits or electrical utilities that trade sulfur dioxide permits. However, for cases in which millions of users emit small amounts of pollution\u2014such as emissions from car engines or unrecycled soda cans\u2014and have no strong interest in trading, pollution charges will typically offer a better choice. Market-oriented environmental tools can also be combined. Marketable permits can be viewed as a form of improved property rights. Or the government could combine marketable permits with a pollution tax on any emissions not covered by a permit.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nExamples of market-oriented environmental policies, also referred to as cap and trade programs, include pollution charges, marketable permits, and better-defined property rights. Market-oriented environmental policies include taxes, markets, and property rights so that those who impose negative externalities must face the social cost.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nClassify the following pollution-control policies as command-and-control or market incentive based.\n\n1.  A state emissions tax on the quantity of carbon emitted by each firm.\n2.  The federal government requires domestic auto companies to improve car emissions by 2020.\n3.  The EPA sets national standards for water quality.\n4.  A city sells permits to firms that allow them to emit a specified quantity of pollution.\n5.  The federal government pays fishermen to preserve salmon.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  market-based\n2.  command-and-control\n3.  command-and-control\n4.  market-based\n5.  market-based\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn emissions tax on a quantity of emissions from a firm is not a command-and-control approach to reducing pollution. Why?\n\n\n\nEven though state or local governments impose these taxes, a company has the flexibility to adopt technologies that will help it avoid the tax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour firms called Elm, Maple, Oak, and Cherry, produce wooden chairs. However, they also produce a great deal of garbage (a mixture of glue, varnish, sandpaper, and wood scraps). The first row of [[link]](#Table_12_07) shows the total amount of garbage (in tons) currently produced by each firm. The other rows of the table show the cost of reducing garbage produced by the first five tons, the second five tons, and so on. First, calculate the cost of requiring each firm to reduce the weight of its garbage by one-fourth. Now, imagine that marketable permits are issued for the current level of garbage, but the permits will shrink the weight of allowable garbage for each firm by one-fourth. What will be the result of this alternative approach to reducing pollution?\n\n|  | **Elm** | **Maple** | **Oak** | **Cherry** |\n|----------\n| **Current production of garbage (in tons)** | **20** | **40** | **60** | **80** |\n| **Cost of reducing garbage by first five tons** | $5,500 | $6,300 | $7,200 | $3,000 |\n| **Cost of reducing garbage by second five tons** | $6,000 | $7,200 | $7,500 | $4,000 |\n| **Cost of reducing garbage by third five tons** | $6,500 | $8,100 | $7,800 | $5,000 |\n| **Cost of reducing garbage by fouth five tons** | $7,000 | $9,000 | $8,100 | $6,000 |\n| **Cost of reducing garbage by fifth five tons** | $0 | $9,900 | $8,400 | $7,000 |\n{: #Table_12_07 summary=\"The table has 6 rows and 4 columns of data.

Total cost of this approach: $59,500. If the system of marketable permits is put in place, and those permits shrink the weight of allowable garbage by one-quarter, then pollution must still be reduced by the same overall amount.

That is big bucks. Is the money well spent?\n\n### Benefits and Costs of Clean Air and Clean Water\n\nThe benefits of a cleaner environment can be divided into four areas: (1) people may stay healthier and live longer; (2) certain industries that rely on clean air and water, such as farming, fishing, and tourism, may benefit; (3) property values may be higher; and (4) people may simply enjoy a cleaner environment in a way that does not need to involve a market transaction. Some of these benefits, such as gains to tourism or farming, are relatively easy to value in economic terms. It is harder to assign a monetary value to others, such as the value of clean air for someone with asthma. It seems impossible to put a clear-cut monetary value on still others, such as the satisfaction you might feel from knowing that the air is clear over the Grand Canyon, even if you have never visited the Grand Canyon.\n\nAlthough estimates of environmental benefits are not precise, they can still be revealing. For example, a study by the Environmental Protection Agency looked at the costs and benefits of the Clean Air Act from 1970 to 1990. It found that total costs over that time period were roughly $500 billion\u2014a huge amount. However, it also found that a middle-range estimate of the health and other benefits from cleaner air was $22 trillion\u2014about 44 times higher than the costs. A more recent study by the EPA estimated that the environmental benefits to Americans from the **Clean Air Act**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} will exceed their costs by a margin of four to one. The EPA estimated that \u201cin 2010 the benefits of Clean Air Act programs will total about $110 billion. This estimate represents the value of avoiding increases in illness and premature death which would have prevailed.\u201d Saying that overall benefits of environmental regulation have exceeded costs in the past, however, is very different from saying that every environmental regulation makes sense. For example, studies suggest that when breaking down emission reductions by type of contaminants, the benefits of air pollution control outweigh the costs primarily for particulates and lead, but when looking at other air pollutants, the costs of reducing them may be comparable to or greater than the benefits. Just because some environmental regulations have had benefits much higher than costs does not prove that every individual regulation is a sensible idea.\n\n### Ecotourism: Making Environmentalism Pay\n\nThe definition of **ecotourism**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is a little vague. Does it mean sleeping on the ground, eating roots, and getting close to wild animals? Does it mean flying in a helicopter to shoot anesthetic darts at African wildlife? Or a little of both? The definition may be fuzzy, but tourists who hope to appreciate the ecology of their destination\u2014\u201ceco tourists\u201d\u2014are the impetus to a big and growing business. The International Ecotourism Society estimates that international tourists interested in seeing nature or wildlife will take 1.56 billion trips by 2020.\n\n\nVisit The International Ecotourism Society\u2019s [website][1] to learn more about The International Ecotourism Society, its programs, and tourism\u2019s role in sustainable community development.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nRealizing the attraction of ecotourism, the residents of low-income countries may come to see that preserving wildlife habitats is more lucrative than, say, cutting down forests or grazing livestock to survive. In South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, for example, a substantial expansion of both rhinoceros and elephant populations is broadly credited to ecotourism, which has given local communities an economic interest in protecting them. Some of the leading ecotourism destinations include: Costa Rica and Panama in Central America; the Caribbean; Malaysia, and other South Pacific destinations; New Zealand; the Serengeti in Tanzania; the Amazon rain forests; and the Galapagos Islands. In many of these countries and regions, governments have enacted policies whereby revenues from ecotourism are shared with local communities, to give people in those local communities a kind of property right that encourages them to conserve their local environment.\n\nEcotourism needs careful management, so that the combination of eager tourists and local entrepreneurs does not destroy what the visitors are coming to see. But whatever one\u2019s qualms are about certain kinds of ecotourism\u2014such as the occasional practice of rich tourists shooting elderly lions with high-powered rifles\u2014it is worth remembering that the alternative is often that low-income people in poor countries will damage their local environment in their effort to survive.\n\n### Marginal Benefits and Marginal Costs\n\nWe can use the tools of marginal analysis to illustrate the marginal costs and the marginal benefits of reducing pollution. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C12_003) illustrates a theoretical model of this situation. When the quantity of environmental protection is low so that pollution is extensive\u2014for example, at quantity Qa\u2014there are usually a lot of relatively cheap and easy ways to reduce pollution, and the **marginal benefits**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of doing so are quite high. At Qa, it makes sense to allocate more resources to fight pollution. However, as the extent of environmental protection increases, the cheap and easy ways of reducing pollution begin to decrease, and more costly methods must be used. The **marginal cost curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} rises. Also, as environmental protection increases, the largest marginal benefits are achieved first, followed by reduced marginal benefits. As the quantity of environmental protection increases to, say, Qb, the gap between marginal benefits and marginal costs narrows. At point Qc the marginal costs will exceed the marginal benefits. At this level of environmental protection, society is not allocating resources efficiently, because too many resources are being given up to reduce pollution.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C12_003 data-title=\"Marginal Costs and Marginal Benefits of Environmental Protection \"}\n\nAs society draws closer to Qb, some might argue that it becomes more important to use market-oriented environmental tools to hold down the costs of reducing pollution. Their objective would be to avoid environmental rules that would provide the quantity of environmental protection at Qc, where marginal costs exceed marginal benefits. The following Clear It Up feature delves into how the EPA measures its policies \u2013 and the monetary value of our lives.\n\n\n\nWhat's a life worth?\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must estimate the value of saving lives by reducing pollution against the additional costs. In measuring the benefits of government environmental policies, the EPA\u2019s National Center for Environmental Economics (NCEE) values a statistical human life at $7.4 million (in 2006 U.S. dollars).\n\nEconomists value a human life on the basis of studies of the value that people actually place on human lives in their own decisions. For example, some jobs have a higher probability of death than others, and these jobs typically pay more to compensate for the risk. Examples are ocean fishery as opposed to fish farming, and ice trucking in Alaska as opposed to truck driving in the \u201clower forty-eight\u201d states.\n\nGovernment regulators use estimates such as these when deciding what proposed regulations are \u201creasonable,\u201d which means deciding which proposals have high enough benefits to justify their cost. For example, when the U.S. Department of Transportation makes decisions about what safety systems should be required in cars or airplanes, it will approve rules only where the estimated cost per life saved is $3 million or less.\n\nResources spent on life-saving regulations create tradeoff. A study by W. Kip Viscusi of Vanderbilt University estimated that when a regulation costs $50 million, it diverts enough spending in the rest of the economy from health care and safety expenditures that it costs a life. This finding suggests that any regulation that costs more than $50 million per life saved actually costs lives, rather than saving them.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nWe can make a strong case, taken as a whole, that the benefits of U.S. environmental regulation have outweighed the costs. As the extent of environment regulation increases, additional expenditures on environmental protection will probably have increasing marginal costs and decreasing marginal benefits. This pattern suggests that the flexibility and cost savings of market-oriented environmental policies will become more important.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nSuppose a city releases 16 million gallons of raw sewage into a nearby lake.

Yet even if most nations individually took steps to address their environmental issues, no nation acting alone can solve certain environmental problems which spill over national borders. No nation by itself can reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by enough to solve the problem of global warming\u2014not without the cooperation of other nations. Another issue is the challenge of preserving **biodiversity**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which includes the full spectrum of animal and plant genetic material. Although a nation can protect biodiversity within its own borders, no nation acting alone can protect biodiversity around the world. Global warming and biodiversity are examples of **international externalities**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nBringing the nations of the world together to address environmental issues requires a difficult set of negotiations between countries with different income levels and different sets of priorities. If nations such as China, India, Brazil, Mexico, and others are developing their economies by burning vast amounts of fossil fuels or by stripping their forest and wildlife habitats, then the world\u2019s high-income countries acting alone will not be able to reduce greenhouse gases. However, low-income countries, with some understandable exasperation, point out that high-income countries do not have much moral standing to lecture them on the necessities of putting environmental protection ahead of economic growth. After all, high-income countries have historically been the primary contributors to greenhouse warming by burning **fossil fuels**{: data-type=\"term\" .no .emphasis}\u2014and still are today. It is hard to tell people who are living in a low-income country, where adequate diet, health care, and education are lacking, that they should sacrifice an improved quality of life for a cleaner environment.\n\nCan rich and poor countries come together to address global environmental spillovers? At the initiative of the European Union and the most vulnerable developing nations, the Durban climate conference in December 2011 launched negotiations to develop a new international climate change agreement that covers all countries. The agreement will take the form of an agreed upon outcome with legal force applicable to all parties. According to the EU, the goal is to adopt the plan in 2015 and implement it in 2020. For the agreement to work, the two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases\u2014China and the United States\u2014will have to sign on.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to learn more about the European Commission.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nIf high-income countries want low-income countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases, then the high-income countries may need to pay some of the costs. Perhaps some of these payments will happen through private markets; for example, some tourists from rich countries will pay handsomely to vacation near the natural treasures of low-income countries. Perhaps some of the transfer of resources can happen through making modern pollution-control technology available to poorer countries.\n\nThe practical details of what such an international system might look like and how it would operate across international borders are forbiddingly complex. But it seems highly unlikely that some form of world government will impose a detailed system of environmental command-and-control regulation around the world. As a result, a decentralized and market-oriented approach may be the only practical way to address international issues such as global warming and biodiversity.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nCertain global environmental issues, such as global warming and biodiversity, spill over national borders and will need to be addressed with some form of international agreement.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nConsider the case of global environmental problems that spill across international borders as a prisoner\u2019s dilemma of the sort studied in [Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly](/m48658){: .target-chapter}.

At one extreme, at a choice like P, a country would be selecting a high level of economic output but very little environmental protection. At the other extreme, at a choice like T, a country would be selecting a high level of environmental protection but little economic output. According to the graph, an increase in environmental protection involves an opportunity cost of less economic output. No matter what their preferences, all societies should wish to avoid choices like M, which are productively inefficient. Efficiency requires that the choice should be on the production possibility frontier.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C12_004 data-title=\"The Tradeoff between Economic Output and Environmental Protection \"}\n\nEconomists do not have a great deal to say about the choice between P, Q, R, S and T in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C12_004), all of which lie along the production possibility frontier. Countries with low per capita **gross domestic product (GDP)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, such as China, place a greater emphasis on economic output\u2014which in turn helps to produce nutrition, shelter, health, education, and desirable consumer goods. Countries with higher income levels, where a greater share of people have access to the basic necessities of life, may be willing to place a relatively greater emphasis on environmental protection.\n\nHowever, economists are united in their belief that an inefficient choice such as M is undesirable. Rather than choosing M, a nation could achieve either greater economic output with the same environmental protection, as at point Q, or greater environmental protection with the same level of output, as at point S. The problem with command-and-control environmental laws is that they sometimes involve a choice like M. Market-oriented environmental tools offer a mechanism either for providing either the same environmental protection at lower cost, or providing a greater degree of environmental protection for the same cost.\n\n\n\nKeystone XL\n\nSo how would an economist respond to claims of environmental damage caused by the Keystone XL project? Clearly the environmental cost of oil spills would be considered a negative externality, but how many external costs would arise? And are these costs \u201ctoo high\u201d when measured against any potential for economic benefit?\n\nAs this chapter indicates, in deciding whether construction of the pipeline is a good idea, an economist would want to know not only about the marginal benefits resulting from the additional pipeline construction, but also the potential marginal costs\u2014and especially the marginal external costs of the pipeline. Typically these come in the form of environmental impact statements, which are usually required for these kinds of projects. The most recent impact statement, released in March 2013 by the Nebraska Department of State, considered the possibility of fewer miles of pipeline going over the aquifer system and avoiding completely environmentally fragile areas; it indicated that \u201cmost resources\u201d would not be harmed by construction of the pipeline.\n\nAs of press time, the Obama Administration has not approved construction of the Keystone XL project. While the economic benefits of additional oil in the United States may be fairly easily quantified, the social costs are not. It seems that, in a period of economic expansion, people want to err on the side of caution and estimate the marginal costs to be greater than the marginal benefits of additional oil generation. Those estimates may change, however, if the price of gasoline continues to rise.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nDepending on their different income levels and political preferences, countries are likely to make different choices about **allocative efficiency**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\u2014that is, the choice between economic output and environmental protection along the production possibility frontier. However, all countries should prefer to make a choice that shows **productive efficiency**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\u2014that is, the choice is somewhere on the production possibility frontier rather than inside it. Revisit [Choice in a World of Scarcity](/m48602){: .target-chapter} for more on these terms.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nA country called Sherwood is very heavily covered with a forest of 50,000 trees. There are proposals to clear some of Sherwood\u2019s forest and grow corn, but obtaining this additional economic output will have an environmental cost from reducing the number of trees. [[link]](#Table_12_17) shows possible combinations of economic output and environmental protection.\n\n<table id=\"Table_12_17\" summary=\"Table has 3 columns and 5 rows of data.

Why?\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  {: #CNX_Econ_C12_005}\n\n\n2.  Of the choices provided, P, R, and S demonstrate productive efficiency. These are the choices on the production possibility frontier.\n3.  Allocative efficiency is determined by the preferences\u2014in this case by the preferences of society as expressed through government and other social institutions. Because you do not have information about these preferences, you really cannot say much about allocative efficiency.\n4.  In the choice between T and R, R should clearly be preferred, because it has both more corn and more trees. This answer illustrates why productive efficiency is beneficial. Compared with choices inside the PPF, it means more of one or both goods.\n5.  In the choice between T and S, it is not possible to say which choice is better. True, S is on the PPF and T is not\u2014but that only addresses the issue of productive efficiency. If a society has a strong preference for economic output and places a lower value on trees, then allocative efficiency may lead to a choice of T over S. Of course, the reverse could also be true, leading to a choice of S. Without information on society\u2019s preferences to judge allocative efficiency, this question cannot be answered.\n6.  Compared with command-and-control policies, market-oriented policies allow either more output with the same environmental protection or more environmental protection with the same level of output\u2014or more of both environmental protection and output. Thus, a choice like Q inside the PPF is more likely to represent a command-and-control policy demand than a choice like S on the frontier of the PPF.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nIn the tradeoff between economic output and environmental protection, what do the combinations on the protection possibility curve represent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does a point inside the production possibility frontier represent?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nTechnological innovations shift the production possibility curve.

The research and development efforts of citizens, scientists, firms, universities, and governments have truly revolutionized the modern economy. To get a sense of how far we have come in a short period of time, let\u2019s compare one of humankind\u2019s greatest achievements to the smartphone most of us have in our coat pocket.\n\nIn 1977 the United States launched Voyager I, a spacecraft originally intended to reach Jupiter and Saturn, to send back photographs and other cosmic measurements. Voyager I, however, kept going, and going\u2014past Jupiter and Saturn\u2014right out of our solar system. At the time of its launch, Voyager had some of the most sophisticated computing processing power NASA could engineer (8,000 instructions per second), but by the time it left the solar system (in 2012, actually) we Earthlings were using handheld devices that could process 14 billion instructions per second.\n\nStill, the technology of today is a spillover product of the incredible feats accomplished by NASA thirty years ago. NASA research, for instance, is responsible for the kidney dialysis and mammogram machines that we use today. Research in new technologies not only produces private benefits to the investing firm, or in this case to NASA, but it also creates benefits for the broader society. In this way, new knowledge often becomes what economists refer to as a public good. This leads us to the topic of this chapter\u2014technology, positive externalities, public goods, and the role of government in the encouragement of innovation and the social benefits that it provides.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Positive Externalities and Public Goods\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Why the Private Sector Under Invests in Technologies\n* How Governments Can Encourage Innovation\n* Public Goods\n\n\n\nCan you imagine a world in which you did not own a cellular phone or use Wikipedia? New technology changes how people live and work and what they buy. Technology includes the invention of new products, new ways of producing goods and services, and even new ways of managing a company more efficiently. Research and development of technology is the difference between horses and automobiles, between candles and electric lights, between fetching water in buckets and indoor plumbing, and between infection and good health from antibiotics.\n\nIn December 2009, ABC News compiled a list of some of the technological breakthroughs that have revolutionized consumer products in the past 10 years:\n\n* GPS tracking devices, originally developed by the defense department and available to consumers in 2000, give users up-to-date information on location and time through satellite technology.\n* In 2000, Toyota introduced the Prius hybrid car, which greatly improved fuel efficiency.\n* Also in 2000, AT&amp;T offered its customers the ability to text on a mobile phone.\n* In 2001, Wikipedia launched a user-generated encyclopedia on the Web.\n* Even though Napster died in 2001, the company launched music downloading and file sharing, which revolutionized how consumers get their music and videos.\n* Friendster kicked off the social networking business in 2003, and Twitter and Facebook followed.\n* In 2003, the Human Genome project was completed. It helps to fight disease and launch new pharmaceutical innovations.\n* Also in 2003, the search engine became a way of life for obtaining information quickly. The search engine companies also became innovators in the digital software that dominates mobile devices.\n* In 2006, Nintendo launched Wii and changed the way video games are played. Players can now be drawn into the action and use their bodies to respond rather than a handheld device.\n* Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007 and launched an entire smartphone industry. In 2015, cell phones now recognize human voices via artificial intelligence.\n\nWith all new technologies, however, there are new challenges. This chapter deals with some of these issues: Will private companies be willing to invest in new technology? In what ways does new technology have positive externalities? What motivates inventors? Does government have a role to play in encouraging research and technology? Are there certain types of goods that markets fail to provide efficiently, and that only government can produce? What happens when consumption or production of a product creates positive externalities? Why is it unsurprising when a common resource, like marine fisheries, is overused?", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48676", "module_title": "Economics - m48676", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48676", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Identify the positive externalities of new technology.\n* Explain the difference between private benefits and social benefits and give examples of each.\n* Calculate and analyze rates of return\n\n\n\nMarket competition can provide an incentive for discovering new technology because a **firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} can earn higher profits by finding a way to produce products more cheaply or to create products with characteristics consumers want. As Gregory Lee, CEO of Samsung said, \u201cRelentless pursuit of new innovation is the key principle of our business and enables consumers to discover a world of possibilities with technology.\u201d An innovative firm knows that it will usually have a temporary edge over its competitors and thus an ability to earn above-normal profits before competitors can catch up.\n\nIn certain cases, however, **competition**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} can discourage new **technology**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, especially when other firms can quickly copy a new idea. Consider a pharmaceutical firm deciding to develop a new drug. On average, it can cost $800 million and take more than a decade to discover a new drug, perform the necessary safety tests, and bring the drug to market. If the research and development (R&amp;D) effort fails\u2014and every R&amp;D project has some chance of failure\u2014then the firm will suffer losses and could even be driven out of business. If the project succeeds, then the firm\u2019s competitors may figure out ways of adapting and copying the underlying idea, but without having to pay the costs themselves. As a result, the innovative company will bear the much higher costs of the R&amp;D and will enjoy at best only a small, temporary advantage over the competition.\n\nMany inventors over the years have discovered that their inventions brought them less profit than they might have reasonably expected.\n\n* Eli Whitney (1765\u20131825) invented the cotton gin, but then southern cotton planters built their own seed-separating devices with a few minor changes in Whitney\u2019s design. When Whitney sued, he found that the courts in southern states would not uphold his patent rights.\n* Thomas Edison (1847\u20131931) still holds the record for most patents granted to an individual. His first invention was an automatic vote counter, and despite the social benefits, he could not find a government that wanted to buy it.\n* Gordon Gould came up with the idea behind the laser in 1957. He put off applying for a patent and, by the time he did apply, other scientists had laser inventions of their own. A lengthy legal battle resulted, in which Gould spent $100,000 on lawyers, before he eventually received a patent for the laser in 1977. Compared to the enormous social benefits of the laser, Gould received relatively little financial reward.\n* In 1936, Turing delivered a paper titled, \\\"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,\\\" in which he presented the notion of a universal machine (later called the \u201cUniversal Turing Machine,\\\" and then the \\\"Turing machine\\\") capable of computing anything that is computable. The central concept of the modern computer was based on Turing\u2019s paper.\n\nA variety of studies by economists have found that the original inventor receives one-third to one-half of the total economic benefits from innovations, while other businesses and new product users receive the rest.\n\n### The Positive Externalities of New Technology   {#ch13mod01_01}\n\nWill private firms in a **market economy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} under invest in research and technology? If a firm builds a factory or buys a piece of equipment, the firm receives all the economic benefits that result from the investments. However, when a firm invests in new technology, the **private benefits**{: data-type=\"term\"}, or profits, that the firm receives are only a portion of the overall social benefits. The **social benefits**{: data-type=\"term\"} of an innovation take into account the value of all the positive externalities of the new idea or product, whether enjoyed by other companies or society as a whole, as well as the private benefits received by the firm that developed the new technology. As you learned in [Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities](/m48668){: .target-chapter}, **positive externalities**{: data-type=\"term\"} are beneficial spillovers to a third party, or parties.\n\nConsider the example of the Big Drug Company, which is planning its R&amp;D budget for the next year. Economists and scientists working for Big Drug have compiled a list of potential research and development projects and estimated rates of return. (The rate of return is the estimated payoff from the project.) [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C13_002) shows how the calculations work. The downward-sloping D<sub>Private</sub> curve represents the firm\u2019s demand for financial capital and reflects the company\u2019s willingness to borrow to finance research and development projects at various interest rates. Suppose that this firm\u2019s investment in research and development creates a spillover benefit to other firms and households. After all, new innovations often spark other creative endeavors that society also values. If we add the spillover benefits society enjoys to the firm\u2019s private demand for financial capital, we can draw D<sub>Social</sub> that lies above D<sub>Private</sub>.\n\nIf there was a way for the firm to fully monopolize those social benefits by somehow making them unavailable to the rest of us, the firm\u2019s private demand curve would be the same as society\u2019s demand curve. According to [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C13_002) and [\\[link\\]](#ch13mod01_tab01), if the going rate of interest on borrowing is 8%, and the company can receive the private benefits of innovation only, then the company would finance $30 million. Society, at the same rate of 8%, would find it optimal to have $52 million of borrowing. Unless there is a way for the company to fully enjoy the total benefits, then it will borrow less than the socially optimal level of $52 million.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C13_002 data-title=\"Positive Externalities and Technology\"}\n\n<table id=\"ch13mod01_tab01\" summary=\"This table has three columns and six rows. The first row is a header row, and it labels the columns, 'Rates of Return', 'D_{Private} (in millions)', and 'D_{Social} (in millions)'.

However, other pharmaceutical firms and health care companies may learn new lessons about how to treat certain medical conditions and are then able to create their own competing products. The social benefit of the drug takes into account the value of all the positive externalities of the drug. If Big Drug were able to gain this social return instead of other companies, its **demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} for financial capital would shift to the demand curve D<sub>Social</sub>, and it would be willing to borrow and invest $52 million. However, if Big Drug is receiving only 50 cents of each dollar of social benefits, the firm will not spend as much on creating new products. The amount it would be willing to spend would fall somewhere in between D<sub>Private</sub> and D<sub>Social</sub>.\n\n### Why Invest in Human Capital?   {#ch13mod01_02}\n\nThe investment in anything, whether it is the construction of a new power plant or research in a new cancer treatment, usually requires a certain upfront cost with an uncertain future benefit. The investment in education, or human capital, is no different. Over the span of many years, a student and her family invest significant amounts of time and money into that student\u2019s education. The idea is that higher levels of educational attainment will eventually serve to increase the student\u2019s future productivity and subsequent ability to earn. Once the numbers are crunched, does this investment pay off for the student?\n\nAlmost universally, economists have found that the answer to this question is a clear \u201cYes.\u201d For example, several studies of the return to education in the United States estimate that the rate of return to a college education is approximately 10%.

After all, if the government is spending taxpayer dollars to subsidize public education, society should expect some kind of return on that spending. Again, economists like **George Psacharopoulos**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} have found that, across a variety of nations, the **social rate of return**{: data-type=\"term\"} on schooling is also positive. After all, positive externalities exist from investment in education. While not always easy to measure, according to **Walter McMahon**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the positive externalities to education typically include better health outcomes for the population, lower levels of crime, a cleaner environment and a more stable, democratic government. For these reasons, many nations have chosen to use taxpayer dollars to subsidize primary, secondary, and higher education. Education clearly benefits the person who receives it, but a society where most people have a good level of education provides positive externalities for all.\n\n### Other Examples of Positive Externalities   {#ch13mod01_03}\n\nAlthough technology may be the most prominent example of a positive externality, it is not the only one. For example, being vaccinated against disease is not only a protection for the individual, but it has the positive spillover of protecting others who may become infected. When a number of homes in a neighborhood are modernized, updated, and restored, not only does it increase the value of those homes, but the value of other properties in the neighborhood may increase as well.\n\nThe appropriate public policy response to a positive externality, like a new technology, is to help the party creating the positive externality receive a greater share of the social benefits. In the case of vaccines, like flu shots, an effective policy might be to provide a subsidy to those who choose to get vaccinated.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C13_004) shows the market for flu shots. The market demand curve D<sub>Market</sub> for flu shots reflects only the marginal private benefits (MPB) that the vaccinated individuals receive from the shots. Assuming that there are no spillover costs in the production of flu shots, the market supply curve is given by the marginal private cost (MPC) of producing the vaccinations.\n\nThe equilibrium quantity of flu shots produced in the market, where MPB is equal to MPC, is Q<sub>Market</sub> and the price of flu shots is P<sub>Market</sub>. However, spillover benefits exist in this market because others, those who chose not to purchase a flu shot, receive a positive externality in a reduced chance of contracting the flu. When we add the spillover benefits to the marginal private benefit of flu shots, the marginal social benefit (MSB) of flu shots is given by D<sub>Social</sub>. Because the MPB is greater than MSB, we see that the socially optimal level of flu shots is greater than the market quantity (Q<sub>Social</sub> exceeds Q<sub>Market</sub>) and the corresponding price of flu shots, if the market were to produce Q<sub>Social</sub>, would be at P<sub>Social</sub>. Unfortunately, the marketplace does not recognize the positive externality and flu shots will go under produced and under consumed.\n\nSo how can government try to move the market level of output closer to the socially desirable level of output? One policy would be to provide a subsidy, like a voucher, to any citizen who wishes to get vaccinated. This voucher would act as \u201cincome\u201d that could be used to purchase only a flu shot and, if the voucher was exactly equal to the per-unit spillover benefits, would increase market equilibrium to a quantity of Q<sub>Social</sub> and a price of P<sub>Social</sub> where MSB equals MSC. Suppliers of the flu shots would receive payment of P<sub>Social</sub> per vaccination, while consumers of flu shots would redeem the voucher and only pay a price of P<sub>Subsidy</sub>. When the government uses a subsidy in this way, the socially optimal quantity of vaccinations is produced.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C13_004 data-title=\"The Market for Flu Shots with Spillover Benefits (A Positive Externality)\"}\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch13mod01_summ}\n\nCompetition creates pressure to innovate. However, if new inventions can be easily copied, then the original inventor loses the incentive to invest further in research and development. New technology often has positive externalities; that is, there are often spillovers from the invention of new technology that benefit firms other than the innovator. The social benefit of an invention, once these spillovers are taken into account, typically exceeds the private benefit to the inventor. If inventors could receive a greater share of the broader social benefits for their work, they would have a greater incentive to seek out new inventions.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch13mod01_sques}\n\n\n\nAre positive externalities reflected in market demand curves? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nNo. A market demand curve reflects only the private benefits of those who are consuming the product. Positive externalities are benefits that spill over to third parties, so they create social benefits, and are not captured by a market (or private benefit) demand curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung\u2019s R&amp;D investment in digital devices has increased profits by 20%. Is this a private or social benefit?\n\n\n\nClearly Samsung is benefiting from the investment, so the 20% increase in profits is a private benefit. If Samsung is unable to capture all of the benefit, perhaps because other companies quickly copy and produce close substitutes, then Samsung\u2019s investment will produce social benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gizmo Company is planning to develop new household gadgets. [[link]](#ch13mod01_tab03) shows the company\u2019s demand for financial capital for research and development of these gadgets, based on expected rates of return from sales. Now, say that every investment would have an additional 5% social benefit\u2014that is, an investment that pays at least a 6% return to the Gizmo Company will pay at least an 11% return for society as a whole; an investment that pays at least 7% for the Gizmo Company will pay at least 12% for society as a whole, and so on. Answer the questions that follow based on this information.\n\n| Estimated Rate of Return | Private profits of the firm from an R&amp;D project (in $ millions) |\n|----------\n| 10% | $100 |\n| 9% | $102 |\n| 8% | $108 |\n| 7% | $118 |\n| 6% | $133 |\n| 5% | $153 |\n| 4% | $183 |\n| 3% | $223 |\n{: #ch13mod01_tab03 summary=\"This table has nine rows and two columns.

If the interest rate is 9%, the cost of financial capital, and the firm can capture the 5% return to society, the firm would invest as if its effective rate of return is 4%, so it will invest $183 million.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Junkbuyers Company travels from home to home, looking for opportunities to buy items that would otherwise be put out with the garbage, but which the company can resell or recycle. Which will be larger, the private or the social benefits?\n\n\n\nWhen the Junkbuyers Company purchases something for resale, presumably both the buyer and the seller benefit\u2014otherwise, they would not need to make the transaction. However, the company also reduces the amount of garbage produced, which saves money for households and/or for the city that disposes of garbage. So the social benefits are larger than the private benefits.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch13mod01_rques}\n\n\n\nIn what ways do company investments in research and development create positive externalities?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the demand for borrowing and investing in R&amp;D be higher or lower if there are no external benefits?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question   {#ch13mod01_ctques}\n\n\n\nCan a company be guaranteed all of the social benefits of a new invention? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems   {#ch13mod01_prob}\n\n\n\nHighFlyer Airlines wants to build new airplanes with greatly increased cabin space. This will allow HighFlyer Airlines to give passengers more comfort and sell more tickets at a higher price. However, redesigning the cabin means rethinking many other elements of the airplane as well, like the placement of engines and luggage, and the most efficient shape of the plane for moving through the air. HighFlyer Airlines has developed a list of possible methods to increase cabin space, along with estimates of how these approaches would affect costs of operating the plane and sales of airline tickets.

For example, if a pharmaceutical firm has a **patent**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} on a new drug, then no other firm can manufacture or sell that drug for twenty-one years, unless the firm with the patent grants permission. Without a patent, the pharmaceutical firm would have to face competition for any successful products, and could earn no more than a normal rate of profit. With a patent, a firm is able to earn monopoly profits on its product for a period of time\u2014which offers an incentive for research and development. In general, how long can \u201ca period of time\u201d be? The Clear it Up discusses patent and copyright protection timeframes for some works you might have heard of.\n\n\n\nHow long is Mickey Mouse protected from being copied?\n\nAll patents and copyrights are scheduled to end someday. In 2003, copyright protection for Mickey Mouse was scheduled to run out. Once the copyright had expired, anyone would be able to copy Mickey Mouse cartoons or draw and sell new ones. In 1998, however, Congress passed the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. For copyrights owned by companies or other entities, it increased or extended the copyright from 75 years to 95 years after publication. For copyrights owned by individuals, it increased or extended the copyright coverage from 50 years to 70 years after death. Along with protecting Mickey for another 20 years, the copyright extension affected about 400,000 books, movies, and songs.\n\n\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C13_003) illustrates how the total number of patent applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as the total number of patents granted, surged in the mid-1990s with the invention of the Internet, and is still going strong today.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C13_003 data-title=\"Patents Filed and Granted, 1981&#x2013;2012\"}\n\nWhile patents provide an incentive to innovate by protecting the innovator, they are not perfect. For example:\n\n* In countries that already have patents, economic studies show that inventors receive only one-third to one-half of the total economic value of their inventions.\n* In a fast-moving high-technology industry like biotechnology or semiconductor design, patents may be almost irrelevant because technology is advancing so quickly.\n* Not every new idea can be protected with a patent or a copyright\u2014for example, a new way of organizing a factory or a new way of training employees.\n* Patents may sometimes cover too much or be granted too easily. In the early 1970s, Xerox had received over 1,700 patents on various elements of the photocopy machine. Every time Xerox improved the photocopier, it received a patent on the improvement.\n* The 21-year time period for a patent is somewhat arbitrary. Ideally, a patent should cover a long enough period of time for the inventor to earn a good return, but not so long that it allows the inventor to charge a monopoly price permanently.\n\nBecause patents are imperfect and do not apply well to all situations, alternative methods of improving the rate of return for inventors of new technology are desirable. Some of these possible alternative policies are described in the following sections.\n\n### Policy #1: Government Spending on Research and Development   {#ch13mod02_02}\n\nIf the private sector does not have sufficient incentive to carry out research and development, one possibility is for the government to fund such work directly. Government spending can provide direct financial support for research and development (R&amp;D) done at colleges and universities, nonprofit research entities, and sometimes by private firms, as well as at government-run laboratories. While government spending on research and development produces technology that is broadly available for firms to use, it costs taxpayers money and can sometimes be directed more for political than for scientific or economic reasons.\n\n\nVisit the NASA [website][1] and the USDA [website][2] to read about government research that would not take place where it left to firms due to the externalities.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nThe first column of [\\[link\\]](#ch13mod02_tab05) shows the sources of total U.S. spending on research and development; the second column shows the total dollars of R&amp;D funding by each source. The third column shows that, relative to the total amount of funding, 26% comes from the federal government, about 67% of R&amp;D is done by industry, and less than 3% is done by universities and colleges. (The percentages below do not add up to exactly 100% due to rounding.)\n\n<table id=\"ch13mod02_tab05\" summary=\"This table has three columns and six rows.

Over time, the U.S. economy has come to rely much more heavily on industry-funded R&amp;D. The federal government has tried to focus its direct R&amp;D spending on areas where private firms are not as active. One difficulty with direct government support of R&amp;D is that it inevitably involves political decisions about which projects are worthy. The scientific question of whether research is worthwhile can easily become entangled with considerations like the location of the congressional district in which the research funding is being spent.\n\n### Policy #2: Tax Breaks for Research and Development   {#ch13mod02_03}\n\nA complementary approach to supporting R&amp;D that does not involve the government\u2019s close scrutiny of specific projects is to give firms a reduction in taxes depending on how much research and development they do. The federal government refers to this policy as the research and experimentation (R&amp;E) tax credit. According to the Treasury Department: \u201c. . . the R&amp;E Credit is also a cost-effective policy for stimulating additional private sector investment. Most recent studies find that each dollar of foregone tax revenue through the R&amp;E Tax Credit causes firms to invest at least a dollar in R&amp;D, with some studies finding a benefit to cost ratio of 2 or 2.96.\u201d\n\n\nVisit this [website][3] for more information on how the R&amp;E Tax Credit encourages investment.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Policy #3 Cooperative Research   {#ch13mod02_04}\n\nState and federal governments support research in a variety of ways. For example, United for Medical Research, a coalition of groups that seek funding for the **National Institutes of Health**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, (which is supported by federal grants), states: \u201cNIH-supported research added $69 billion to our GDP and supported seven million jobs in 2011 alone.\u201d The United States remains the leading sponsor of medical-related research spending $117 billion in 2011. Other institutions, such as the **National Academy of Scientists**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and the **National Academy of Engineers**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, receive federal grants for innovative projects. The **Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} at the United States Department of Agriculture awards federal grants to projects that apply the best science to the most important agricultural problems, from food safety to childhood obesity. Cooperation between government-funded universities, academies, and the private sector can spur product innovation and create whole new industries.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch13mod02_summ}\n\nPublic policy with regard to technology must often strike a balance. For example, patents provide an incentive for inventors, but they should be limited to genuinely new inventions and not extend forever.\n\nGovernment has a variety of policy tools for increasing the rate of return for new technology and encouraging its development, including: direct government funding of R&amp;D, tax incentives for R&amp;D, protection of intellectual property, and forming cooperative relationships between universities and the private sector.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch13mod02_sques}\n\n\n\nWhen a neighborhood is cleaned up and kept neat, there are a number of positive spillovers: higher property values, less crime, happier residents. What types of government policies can encourage neighborhoods to clean up?\n\n\n\nGovernment programs that either pay for neighborhood clean-up directly or that provide reduced tax payments for those who clean up or fix up their own property could be enacted. It is also easy to imagine how a city might allow its businesses to form a group that would pay for and manage neighborhood cleanup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation provides both private benefits to those who receive it and broader social benefits for the economy as a whole. Think about the types of policies a government can follow to address the issue of positive spillovers in technology and then suggest a parallel set of policies that governments could follow for addressing positive externalities in education.\n\n\n\nGovernment programs that either pay for education directly or that provide loans or reduced tax payments for education could create positive spillovers. A city might allow its businesses to form a group that would coordinate business efforts with schools and local colleges and universities\u2014allowing students to obtain real-world experience in their chosen fields and providing businesses with enthusiastic, trained workers.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch13mod02_rques}\n\n\n\nWhy might private markets tend to provide too few incentives for the development of new technology?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat can government do to encourage the development of new technology?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question   {#ch13mod02_ctques}\n\n\n\nIs it inevitable that government must become involved in supporting investments in new technology?\n\n\n\n\n### Problem   {#ch13mod02_prob}\n\n\n\nThe marginal private costs and the marginal private benefits of a firm producing fuel-efficient cars is represented in the following diagram (show the equilibrium P\\_market, Q\\_market). The government would like to increase the amount of fuel-efficient cars to be produced and sold to Q\\_social. One way that the government can try to increase production of fuel-efficient cars is by making them cheaper to produce, by subsidizing their production. Show, on the same graph, the amount of subsidy needed to increase the equilibrium quantity of fuel-efficient cars to Q\\_social. *Hint*: the government is trying to affect production through costs, not benefits.\n\n\n\n\n### References   {#ch13mod02_ref}\n\nUnited States Department of the Treasury. \u201cResearch and Experimentation Tax Credit.\u201d Accessed November 2013. http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/news/Pages/investing-in-us-competitiveness.aspx.\n\nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 2015. \u201cU.S. Patent Statistics: Calendar Years 1963\u20132014.\u201d Accessed April 10, 2015. http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/us\\\\\\_stat.pdf.\n\nUnited for Medical Research. \u201cProfiles of Prosperity: How NIH-Supported Research Is Fueling Private Sector Growth and Innovation.\u201d Introduction.

This kind of good is called a **public good**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Spending on national defense is a good example of a public good. Let\u2019s begin by defining the characteristics of a public good and discussing why these characteristics make it difficult for private firms to supply public goods. Then we will see how government may step in to address the issue.\n\n### The Definition of a Public Good   {#ch13mod03_01}\n\nEconomists have a strict definition of a public good, and it does not necessarily include all goods financed through taxes. To understand the defining characteristics of a public good, first consider an ordinary private good, like a piece of pizza. A piece of pizza can be bought and sold fairly easily because it is a separate and identifiable item. However, public goods are not separate and identifiable in this way.\n\nInstead, public goods have two defining characteristics: they are nonexcludable and nonrivalrous. The first characteristic, that a public good is **nonexcludable**{: data-type=\"term\"}, means that it is costly or impossible to exclude someone from using the good. If Larry buys a private good like a piece of pizza, then he can exclude others, like Lorna, from eating that pizza. However, if national defense is being provided, then it includes everyone. Even if you strongly disagree with America\u2019s defense policies or with the level of defense spending, the national defense still protects you. You cannot choose to be unprotected, and national defense cannot protect everyone else and exclude you.\n\nThe second main characteristic of a public good, that it is **nonrivalrous**{: data-type=\"term\"}, means that when one person uses the public good, another can also use it. With a private good like pizza, if Max is eating the pizza then Michelle cannot also eat it; that is, the two people are rivals in consumption. With a public good like national defense, Max\u2019s consumption of national defense does not reduce the amount left for Michelle, so they are nonrivalrous in this area.\n\nA number of government services are examples of public goods. For instance, it would not be easy to provide fire and police service so that some people in a neighborhood would be protected from the burning and burglary of their property, while others would not be protected at all. Protecting some necessarily means protecting others, too.\n\nPositive externalities and public goods are closely related concepts. Public goods have positive externalities, like police protection or public health funding. Not all goods and services with positive externalities, however, are public goods. Investments in education have huge positive spillovers but can be provided by a private company. Private companies can invest in new inventions such as the Apple iPad and reap profits that may not capture all of the social benefits. Patents can also be described as an attempt to make new inventions into private goods, which are excludable and rivalrous, so that no one but the inventor is allowed to use them during the length of the patent.\n\n### The Free Rider Problem of Public Goods   {#ch13mod03_02}\n\nPrivate companies find it difficult to produce public goods. If a good or service is nonexcludable, like national defense, so that it is impossible or very costly to exclude people from using this good or service, then how can a firm charge people for it?\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read about a connection between free riders and \u201cbad music.\u201d\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nWhen individuals make decisions about buying a public good, a **free rider**{: data-type=\"term\"} problem can arise, in which people have an incentive to let others pay for the public good and then to \u201cfree ride\u201d on the purchases of others. The free rider problem can be expressed in terms of the prisoner\u2019s dilemma game, which is discussed as a representation of oligopoly in [Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly](/m48658){: .target-chapter}. Say that two people are thinking about contributing to a public good: Rachel and Samuel. When either of them contributes to a public good, such as a local fire department, their personal cost of doing so is $4 and the social benefit of that person\u2019s contribution is $6. Because society\u2019s benefit of $6 is greater than the cost of $4, the investment is a good idea for society as a whole. The problem is that, while Rachel and Samuel pay for the entire cost of their contribution to the public good, they receive only half of the benefit, because the benefit of the public good is divided equally among the members of society. This sets up the prisoner\u2019s dilemma illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#ch13mod03_tab06).\n\n<table id=\"ch13mod03_tab06\" summary=\"This table has three columns and three rows. The first row and the first column both serve as header rows. The first row is labeled 'Rachel (R) Contribute' and the second row is labeled 'Rachel (R) Do Not Contribute'. The first column is labeled 'Samuel (S) Contribute' and the second column is labeled 'Samuel (S) Do Not Contribute'.

Suppose, however, that only Rachel contributes, while Samuel does not. Rachel incurs a cost of $4, but receives only $3 of benefit (half of the total $6 of benefit to society), while Samuel incurs no cost, and yet he also receives $3 of benefit. In this outcome, Rachel actually loses $1 while Samuel gains $3. A similar outcome, albeit with roles reversed, would occur if Samuel had contributed, but Rachel had not. Finally, if both parties contribute, then each incurs a cost of $4 and each receives $6 of benefit (half of the total $12 benefit to society). There is a dilemma with the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma, though. See the Work it Out feature.\n\n\n\nThe Problem with the Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma\n\nThe difficulty with the prisoner\u2019s dilemma arises as each person thinks through his or her strategic choices.\n\nStep 1. Rachel reasons in this way: If Samuel does not contribute, then I would be a fool to contribute. However, if Samuel does contribute, then I can come out ahead by not contributing.\n\nStep 2. Either way, I should choose not to contribute, and instead hope that I can be a free rider who uses the public good paid for by Samuel.\n\nStep 3. Samuel reasons the same way about Rachel.\n\nStep 4. When both people reason in that way, the public good never gets built, and there is no movement to the option where everyone cooperates\u2014which is actually best for all parties.\n\n\n\n### The Role of Government in Paying for Public Goods   {#ch13mod03_03}\n\nThe key insight in paying for public goods is to find a way of assuring that everyone will make a contribution and to prevent free riders. For example, if people come together through the political process and agree to pay taxes and make group decisions about the quantity of public goods, they can defeat the free rider problem by requiring, through the law, that everyone contributes.\n\nHowever, government spending and taxes are not the only way to provide public goods. In some cases, markets can produce public goods. For example, think about radio. It is nonexcludable, since once the radio signal is being broadcast, it would be very difficult to stop someone from receiving it. It is nonrivalrous, since one person listening to the signal does not prevent others from listening as well. Because of these features, it is practically impossible to charge listeners directly for listening to conventional radio broadcasts.\n\nRadio has found a way to collect revenue by selling advertising, which is an indirect way of \u201ccharging\u201d listeners by taking up some of their time. Ultimately, consumers who purchase the goods advertised are also paying for the radio service, since the cost of advertising is built into the product cost. In a more recent development, satellite radio companies, such as SirusXM, charge a regular subscription fee for streaming music without commercials. In this case, however, the product is excludable\u2014only those who pay for the subscription will receive the broadcast.\n\nSome public goods will also have a mixture of public provision at no charge along with fees for some purposes, like a public city park that is free to use, but the government charges a fee for parking your car, for reserving certain picnic grounds, and for food sold at a refreshment stand.\n\n\nRead this [article][2] to find out what economists say the government should pay for.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nIn other cases, social pressures and personal appeals can be used, rather than the force of law, to reduce the number of free riders and to collect resources for the public good. For example, neighbors sometimes form an association to carry out beautification projects or to patrol their area after dark to discourage crime. In low-income countries, where social pressure strongly encourages all farmers to participate, farmers in a region may come together to work on a large irrigation project that will benefit all. Many fundraising efforts, including raising money for local charities and for the endowments of colleges and universities, also can be viewed as an attempt to use social pressure to discourage free riding and to generate the outcome that will produce a public benefit.\n\n### Common Resources and the \u201cTragedy of the Commons\u201d   {#ch13mod03_04}\n\nThere are some goods that do not fall neatly into the categories of private good or public good. While it is easy to classify a pizza as a private good and a city park as a public good, what about an item that is nonexcludable and rivalrous, such as the queen conch?\n\nIn the Caribbean, the queen conch is a large marine mollusk found in shallow waters of sea grass. These waters are so shallow, and so clear, that a single diver may harvest many conch in a single day. Not only is conch meat a local delicacy and an important part of the local diet, but the large ornate shells are used in art and can be crafted into musical instruments. Because almost anyone with a small boat, snorkel, and mask, can participate in the conch harvest, it is essentially nonexcludable. At the same time, fishing for conch is rivalrous; once a diver catches one conch it cannot be caught by another diver.\n\nGoods that are nonexcludable and rivalrous are called **common resources**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Because the waters of the Caribbean are open to all conch fishermen, and because any conch that *you* catch is conch that *I* cannot catch, common resources like the conch tend to be overharvested.\n\nThe problem of overharvesting common resources is not a new one, but ecologist Garret Hardin put the tag \u201cTragedy of the Commons\u201d to the problem in a 1968 article in the magazine *Science*. Economists view this as a problem of property rights. Since nobody owns the ocean, or the conch that crawl on the sand beneath it, no one individual has an incentive to protect that resource and responsibly harvest it. To address the issue of overharvesting conch and other marine fisheries, economists typically advocate simple devices like fishing licenses, harvest limits, and shorter fishing seasons. When the population of a species drops to critically low numbers, governments have even banned the harvest until biologists determine that the population has returned to sustainable levels. In fact, such is the case with the conch, the harvesting of which has been effectively banned in the United States since 1986.\n\n\nVisit this [website][3] for more on the queen conch industry.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Positive Externalities in Public Health Programs   {#ch13mod03_05}\n\nOne of the most remarkable changes in the standard of living in the last several centuries is that people are living longer. Thousands of years ago, human life expectancy is believed to have been in the range of 20 to 30 years. By 1900, average life expectancy in the United States was 47 years. By 2015, life expectancy is 79 years. Most of the gains in life expectancy in the history of the human race happened in the twentieth century.\n\nThe rise in life expectancy seems to stem from three primary factors. First, systems for providing clean water and disposing of human waste helped to prevent the transmission of many diseases. Second, changes in public behavior have advanced health. Early in the twentieth century, for example, people learned the importance of boiling bottles before using them for food storage and baby\u2019s milk, washing their hands, and protecting food from flies. More recent behavioral changes include reducing the number of people who smoke tobacco and precautions to limit sexually transmitted diseases. Third, medicine has played a large role. Immunizations for diphtheria, cholera, pertussis, tuberculosis, tetanus, and yellow fever were developed between 1890 and 1930. Penicillin, discovered in 1941, led to a series of other antibiotic drugs for bringing infectious diseases under control. In recent decades, drugs that reduce the risks of high blood pressure have had a dramatic effect in extending lives.\n\nThese advances in public health have all been closely linked to positive externalities and public goods. Public health officials taught hygienic practices to mothers in the early 1900s and encouraged less smoking in the late 1900s. Many public sanitation systems and storm sewers were funded by government because they have the key traits of public goods. In the twentieth century, many medical discoveries came out of government or university-funded research. Patents and intellectual property rights provided an additional incentive for private inventors. The reason for requiring immunizations, phrased in economic terms, is that it prevents spillovers of illness to others\u2014as well as helping the person immunized.\n\n\n\nThe Benefits of Voyager I Live On\n\nWhile we applaud the technology spillovers of NASA\u2019s space projects, we should also acknowledge that those benefits are not shared equally. Economists like **Tyler Cowen**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, a professor at George Mason University, are seeing more and more evidence of a widening gap between those who have access to rapidly improving technology, and those who do not. According to Cowen author of the recent book, *Average Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation*, this inequality in access to technology and information is going to deepen the inequality in skills, and ultimately, in wages and global standards of living.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch13mod03_summ}\n\nA public good has two key characteristics: it is nonexcludable and nonrivalrous. Nonexcludable means that it is costly or impossible for one user to exclude others from using the good. Nonrivalrous means that when one person uses the good, it does not prevent others from using it. Markets often have a difficult time producing public goods because free riders will attempt to use the public good without paying for it. The free rider problem can be overcome through measures to assure that users of the public good pay for it. Such measures include government actions, social pressures, and specific situations where markets have discovered a way to collect payments.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch13mod03_sques}\n\n\n\nWhich of the following goods or services are nonexcludable?\n\n1.  police protection\n2.  streaming music from satellite transmission programs\n3.  roads\n4.  primary education\n5.  cell phone service\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  Once citizens are protected from crime, it is difficult to exclude someone from this protection, so it is nonexcludable.\n2.  Some satellite radio services, such as SiriusXM, are sold by subscription fee, so it is excludable.\n3.  Once a road is built it is difficult to exclude people, although toll roads can exclude non-payers.\n4.  Primary education can be provided by private companies and so it is excludable.\n5.  Companies sell cell phone service and exclude those who do not pay.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre the following goods nonrivalrous in consumption?\n\n1.  slice of pizza\n2.  laptop computer\n3.  public radio\n4.  ice cream cone\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  Two people cannot enjoy the same slice of pizza at the same time, so private goods, such as a slice of pizza, are rivalrous.\n2.  Two people cannot use one laptop at the same time, so they are rivalrous in consumption.\n3.  Public radio can be heard by anyone with a radio, so many people can listen at the same time\u2014the good is nonrivalrous.\n4.  It is difficult for two people to simultaneously eat an ice cream cone, so it is rivalrous in consumption.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch13mod03_rques}\n\n\n\nWhat are the two key characteristics of public goods?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName two public goods and explain why they are public goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the free rider problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain why the federal government funds national defense.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#ch13mod03_ctques}\n\n\n\nHow do public television stations, like PBS, try to overcome the free rider problem?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is a football game on ESPN a quasi-public good but a game on the NBC, CBS, or ABC is a public good?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide two examples of goods/services that are classified as private goods/services even though they are provided by a federal government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadio stations, tornado sirens, light houses, and street lights are all public goods in that all are nonrivalrous and nonexclusionary. Therefore why does the government provide tornado sirens, street lights and light houses but not radio stations (other than PBS stations)?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems   {#ch13mod03_prob}\n\n\n\nBecky and Sarah are sisters who share a room. Their room can easily get messy, and their parents are always telling them to clean it up. Here are the costs and benefits to both Becky and Sarah, of taking the time to clean their room: If both Becky and Sarah clean, they each spends two hours and get a clean room. If Becky decides not to clean and Sarah does all the cleaning, then Sarah spends 10 hours cleaning (Becky spends 0) but Sarah is exhausted. The same would occur for Becky if Sarah decided not to clean\u2014Becky spends 10 hours and becomes exhausted. If both girls decide not to clean, they both have a dirty room.\n\n1.  What is the best outcome for Becky and Sarah? What is the worst outcome? (It would help you to construct a prisoner\u2019s dilemma table.)\n2.  Unfortunately, we know that the optimal outcome will most likely not happen, and that the worst one will probably be chosen instead. Explain what it is about Becky\u2019s and Sarah\u2019s reasoning that will lead them both to choose the worst outcome.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### References   {#ch13mod03_ref}\n\nCowen, Tyler. *Average Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation*.

Calling their protest \u201cOccupy Wall Street,\u201d they argued that the concentration of wealth among the richest 1% in the United States was both economically unsustainable and inequitable, and needed to be changed. The protest then spread to other major cities, and the Occupy movement was born.\n\nWhy were people so upset? How much wealth is concentrated among the top 1% in our society? How did they acquire so much wealth? These are very real, very important questions in the United States now, and this chapter on poverty and economic inequality will help us address the causes behind this sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Poverty and Economic Inequality\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Drawing the Poverty Line\n* The Poverty Trap\n* The Safety Net\n* Income Inequality: Measurement and Causes\n* Government Policies to Reduce Income Inequality\n\n\n\nThe labor markets that determine what workers are paid do not take into account how much income a family needs for food, shelter, clothing, and health care. Market forces do not worry about what happens to families when a major local employer goes out of business. Market forces do not take time to contemplate whether those who are earning higher incomes should pay an even higher share of taxes.\n\nHowever, labor markets do create considerable inequalities of income. In 2014, the median American family income was $57,939 (the median is the level where half of all families had more than that level and half had less). According to the U.S. Census Bureau, almost nine million U.S. families were classified by the federal government as being below the poverty line in that year. Think about a family of three\u2014perhaps a single mother with two children\u2014attempting to pay for the basics of life on perhaps $17,916 per year. After paying for rent, healthcare, clothing, and transportation, such a family might have $6,000 to spend on food. Spread over 365 days, the food budget for the entire family would be about $17 per day. To put this in perspective, most cities have restaurants where $17 will buy you an appetizer for one.\n\nThis chapter explores how the U.S. government defines poverty, the balance between assisting the poor without discouraging work, and how federal antipoverty programs work. It also discusses income inequality\u2014how economists measure inequality, why inequality has changed in recent decades, the range of possible government policies to reduce inequality, and the danger of a tradeoff that too great a reduction in inequality may reduce incentives for producing output.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

Poverty is measured by the number of people who fall below a certain level of income\u2014called the **poverty line**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014that defines the income needed for a basic standard of living. **Income**{: data-type=\"term\"} **inequality**{: data-type=\"term\"} compares the share of the total income (or wealth) in society that is received by different groups; for example, comparing the share of income received by the top 10% to the share of income received by the bottom 10%.\n\nIn the United States, the official definition of the poverty line traces back to a single person: **Mollie Orshansky**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. In 1963, Orshansky, who was working for the Social Security Administration, published an article called \u201cChildren of the Poor\u201d in a highly useful and dry-as-dust publication called the *Social Security Bulletin*. Orshansky\u2019s idea was to define a poverty line based on the cost of a healthy diet.\n\nHer previous job had been at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where she had worked in an agency called the Bureau of Home Economics and Human Nutrition. One task of this bureau had been to calculate how much it would cost to feed a nutritionally adequate diet to a family. Orshansky found that the average family spent one-third of its income on food. She then proposed that the poverty line be the amount needed to buy a nutritionally adequate diet, given the size of the family, multiplied by three.\n\nThe current U.S. poverty line is essentially the same as the Orshansky poverty line, although the dollar amounts are adjusted each year to represent the same buying power over time. The U.S. poverty line in 2015 ranged from $11,790 for a single individual to $25,240 for a household of four people.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_001) shows the U.S. **poverty rate**{: data-type=\"term\"} over time; that is, the percentage of the population below the poverty line in any given year. The poverty rate declined through the 1960s, rose in the early 1980s and early 1990s, but seems to have been slightly lower since the mid-1990s. However, in no year in the last four decades has the poverty rate been less than 11% of the U.S. population\u2014that is, at best about one American in nine is below the poverty line. In recent years, the poverty rate appears to have peaked at 15.9% in 2011 before dropping to 14.5% in 2013. [\\[link\\]](#ch14mod01_tab01) compares poverty rates for different groups in 2011. As you will see when we delve further into these numbers, poverty rates are relatively low for whites, for the elderly, for the well-educated, and for male-headed households. Poverty rates for females, Hispanics, and African Americans are much higher than for whites. While Hispanics and African Americans have a higher percentage of individuals living in poverty than others, most people in the United States living below the poverty line are white.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] for more information on U.S. poverty.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch14mod01_qr01\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C14_001 data-title=\"The U.S. Poverty Rate since 1960\"}\n\n<table id=\"ch14mod01_tab01\" summary=\"This table has two columns and thirteen rows.

In a vast country like the United States, should there be a national poverty line? After all, according to the Federal Register, the median household income for a family of four was $102,552 in New Jersey and $57,132 in Mississippi in 2013, and prices of some basic goods like housing are quite different between states. The poverty line is based on cash income, which means it does not take into account government programs that provide assistance to the poor in a non-cash form, like **Medicaid**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (health care for low-income individuals and families) and food aid. Also, low-income families can qualify for federal housing assistance. (These and other government aid programs will be discussed in detail later in this chapter.)\n\nShould the poverty line be adjusted to take the value of such programs into account? Many economists and policymakers wonder whether the concept of what poverty means in the twenty-first century should be rethought. The following Clear It Up feature explains the poverty lines set by the World Bank for low-income countries around the world.\n\n\n\nHow is poverty measured in low-income countries?\n\nThe World Bank sets two poverty lines for low-income countries around the world. One poverty line is set at an income of $1.25/day per person; the other is at $2/day. By comparison, the U.S. 2015 poverty line of $20,090 annually for a family of three works out to $18.35 per person per day.\n\nClearly, many people around the world are far poorer than Americans, as [\\[link\\]](#ch14mod01_tab02) shows. China and India both have more than a billion people; Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa; and Egypt is the most populous country in the Middle East. In all four of those countries, in the mid-2000s, a substantial share of the population subsisted on less than $2/day. Indeed, about half the world lives on less than $2.50 a day, and 80 percent of the world lives on less than $10 per day. (Of course, the cost of food, clothing, and shelter in those countries can be very different from those costs in the United States, so the $2 and $2.50 figures may mean greater purchasing power than they would in the United States.)\n\n<table id=\"ch14mod01_tab02\" summary=\"The table shows the poverty lines for six low-income countries in the mid 2000s. Column 1 lists the low-income countries. Column 2 lists the share of each country&#x2019;s population that makes below $1.25 per day.

If Congress voted every few years to redefine what poverty means, then it would be difficult to compare rates over time. After all, would a lower poverty rate mean that the definition had been changed, or that people were actually better off? Government statisticians at the U.S. Census Bureau have ongoing research programs to address questions like these.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch14mod01_summ}\n\nWages are influenced by supply and demand in labor markets, which can lead to very low incomes for some people and very high incomes for others. Poverty and income inequality are not the same thing. Poverty applies to the condition of people who cannot afford the necessities of life. Income inequality refers to the disparity between those with higher and lower incomes. The poverty rate is what percentage of the population lives below the poverty line, which is determined by the amount of income that it takes to purchase the necessities of life. Choosing a poverty line will always be somewhat controversial.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch14mod01_sques}\n\n\n\nDescribe how each of these changes is likely to affect poverty and inequality:\n\n1.  Incomes rise for low-income and high-income workers, but rise more for the high-income earners.\n2.  Incomes fall for low-income and high-income workers, but fall more for high-income earners.\n{: type=\"a\" .lower-alpha}\n\n\n\n1.  Poverty falls, inequality rises.\n2.

When people are provided with food, shelter, healthcare, income, and other necessities, assistance may reduce their incentive to work. Consider a program to fight poverty that works in this reasonable-sounding manner: the government provides assistance to the poor, but as the poor earn income to support themselves, the government reduces the level of assistance it provides. With such a program, every time a poor person earns $100, the person loses $100 in government support. As a result, the person experiences no net gain for working. Economists call this problem the **poverty trap**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nConsider the situation faced by a single-parent family. A single mother (earning $8 an hour) with two children, as illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_002). First, consider the **labor-leisure budget constraint**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} faced by this family in a situation without government assistance. On the horizontal axis is hours of leisure (or time spent with family responsibilities) increasing in quantity from right to left. Also on the horizontal axis is the number of hours at paid work, going from zero hours on the right to the maximum of 2,500 hours on the left. On the vertical axis is the amount of income per year rising from low to higher amounts of income. The budget constraint line shows that at zero hours of leisure and 2,500 hours of work, the maximum amount of income is $20,000 ($8 \u00d7 2,500 hours). At the other extreme of the budget constraint line, an individual would work zero hours, earn zero income, but enjoy 2,500 hours of leisure. At point A on the **budget constraint line**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, by working 40 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, the utility-maximizing choice is to work a total of 2,000 hours per year and earn $16,000.\n\nNow suppose that a government antipoverty program guarantees every family with a single mother and two children $18,000 in income. This is represented on the graph by a horizontal line at $18,000. With this program, each time the mother earns $1,000, the government will deduct $1,000 of its support.

If the mother does not work at all, she receives $18,000, all from the government. If she works full time, giving up 40 hours per week with her children, she still ends up with $18,000 at the end of the year. Only if she works 2,300 hours in the year\u2014which is an average of 44 hours per week for 50 weeks a year\u2014does household income rise to $18,400. Even in this case, all of her year\u2019s work means that household income rises by only $400 over the income she would receive if she did not work at all. She would need to work 50 hours a week to reach $20,000.\n\nIndeed, the poverty trap is even stronger than this simplified example shows, because a working mother will have extra expenses like clothing, transportation, and child care that a nonworking mother will not face, making the economic gains from working even smaller. Moreover, those who do not work fail to build up job experience and contacts, which makes working in the future even less likely.\n\nThe bite of the poverty trap can be reduced by designing an antipoverty program so that, instead of reducing government payments by $1 for every $1 earned, payments are reduced by some smaller amount instead. The bite of the poverty trap can also be reduced by imposing requirements for work as a condition of receiving benefits and setting a time limit on benefits.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_003) illustrates a government program that guarantees $18,000 in income, even for those who do not work at all, but then reduces this amount by 50 cents for each $1 earned. The new, higher budget line in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_003) shows that, with this program, additional hours of work will bring some economic gain. Because of the reduction in government income when an individual works, an individual earning $8.00 will really net only $4.00 per hour. The vertical intercept of this higher budget constraint line is at $28,000 ($18,000 + 2,500 hours \u00d7 $4.00 = $28,000). The horizontal intercept is at the point on the graph where $18,000 and 2500 hours of leisure is set. [\\[link\\]](#ch14mod02_tab04) shows the total income differences with various choices of labor and leisure.\n\nHowever, this type of program raises other issues. First, even if it does not eliminate the incentive to work by reducing government payments by $1 for every $1 earned, enacting such a program may still reduce the incentive to work. At least some people who would be working 2,000 hours each year without this program might decide to work fewer hours but still end up with more income\u2014that is, their choice on the new budget line would be like S, above and to the right of the original choice P. Of course, others may choose a point like R, which involves the same amount of work as P, or even a point to the left of R that involves more work.\n\nThe second major issue is that when the government phases out its support payments more slowly, the antipoverty program costs more money. Still, it may be preferable in the long run to spend more money on a program that retains a greater incentive to work, rather than spending less money on a program that nearly eliminates any gains from working.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C14_003 data-title=\"Loosening the Poverty Trap: Reducing Government Assistance by 50 Cents for Every $1 Earned\"}\n\n<table id=\"ch14mod02_tab04\" summary=\"The table shows the total income differences with various choices of labor and leisure; government assistance is reduced by 50 cents for every dollar earned.

Although these programs vary from state to state, it is generally a true statement that in many states from the 1960s into the 1980s, if poor people worked, their level of income barely rose\u2014or did not rise at all\u2014after the reduction in government support payments was factored in. The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens.\n\n\n\nCalculating a Budget Constraint Line\n\nJason earns $9.00 an hour, and a government antipoverty program provides a floor of $10,000 guaranteed income. The government reduces government support by $0.50 for each $1.00 earned. What are the horizontal and vertical intercepts of the budget constraint line? Assume the maximum hours for work or leisure is 2,500 hours.\n\nStep 1. Determine the amount of the government guaranteed income. In this case, it is $10,000.\n\nStep 2. Plot that guaranteed income as a horizontal line on the budget constraint line.\n\nStep 3. Determine what Jason earns if he has no income and enjoys 2,500 hours of leisure. In this case, he will receive the guaranteed $10,000 (the horizontal intercept).\n\nStep 4. Calculate how much Jason\u2019s salary will be reduced by due to the reduction in government income. In Jason\u2019s case, it will be reduced by one half. He will, in effect, net only $4.50 an hour.\n\nStep 5. If Jason works 1,000 hours, at a maximum what income will Jason receive? Jason will get the government assistance of $10,000. He will net only $4.50 for every hour he chooses to work. If he works 1,000 hours at $4.50, his earned income is $4,500 plus the government income of $10,000. Thus the total maximum income (the vertical intercept) is $10,000 + $4,500 = $14,500.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch14mod02_summ}\n\nA poverty trap occurs when government-support payments for the poor decline as the poor earn more income. As a result, the poor do not end up with much more income when they work, because the loss of government support largely or completely offsets any income that is earned by working. The bite of the poverty trap can be reduced by phasing out government benefits more slowly, as well as by imposing requirements for work as a condition of receiving benefits and a time limit on benefits.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch14mod02_sques}\n\n\n\nJonathon is a single father with one child. He can work as a server for $6 per hour for up to 1,500 hours per year. He is eligible for welfare, and so if he does not earn any income, he will receive a total of $10,000 per year. He can work and still receive government benefits, but for every $1 of income, his welfare stipend is $1 less. Create a table similar to [[link]](#ch14mod02_tab04) that shows Jonathan\u2019s options.

Such programs are called the **safety net**{: data-type=\"term\"}, in recognition of the fact that they offer some protection for those who find themselves without jobs or income.\n\n### Temporary Assistance for Needy Families   {#ch14mod03_01}\n\nFrom the Great Depression of the 1930s until 1996, the United States\u2019 most visible antipoverty program was **Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which provided cash payments to mothers with children who were below the poverty line. This program was often just called \u201cwelfare.\u201d In 1996, Congress passed and President Bill Clinton signed into law the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, more commonly called the \u201cwelfare reform act.\u201d The new law replaced AFDC with **Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to watch a video of President Bill Clinton\u2019s Welfare Reform speech.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch14mod03_qr01\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nTANF brought several dramatic changes in how welfare operated. Under the old AFDC program, states set the level of welfare benefits that they would pay to the poor, and the federal government guaranteed it would chip in some of the money as well. The federal government\u2019s welfare spending would rise or fall depending on the number of poor people, and on how each state set its own welfare contribution.\n\nUnder TANF, however, the federal government gives a fixed amount of money to each state. The state can then use the money for almost any program with an antipoverty component: for example, the state might use the money to give cash to poor families, or to reduce teenage pregnancy, or even to raise the high school graduation rate. However, the federal government imposed two key requirements. First, if states are to keep receiving the TANF grants, they must impose work requirements so that most of those receiving TANF benefits are working (or attending school). Second, no one can receive TANF benefits with federal money for more than a total of five years over his or her lifetime. The old AFDC program had no such work requirements or time limits.\n\nTANF attempts to avoid the poverty trap by requiring that welfare recipients work and by limiting the length of time they can receive benefits. In its first few years, the program was quite successful. The number of families receiving payments in 1995, the last year of AFDC, was 4.8 million. By 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service, the average number of families receiving payments under TANF was 1.8 million\u2014a decline of more than half.\n\nTANF benefits to poor families vary considerably across states. For example, again according to the Congressional Research Service, in 2011 the highest monthly payment in Alaska to a single mother with two children was $923, while in Mississippi the highest monthly payment to that family was $170. These payments reflect differences in states\u2019 cost of living. Total spending on TANF was approximately $16.6 billion in 1997. As of 2012, spending was at $12 billion, an almost 28% decrease, split about evenly between the federal and state governments. When you take into account the effects of inflation, the decline is even greater. Moreover, there seemed little evidence that poor families were suffering a reduced standard of living as a result of TANF\u2014although, on the other side, there was not much evidence that poor families had greatly improved their total levels of income, either.\n\n### The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)   {#ch14mod03_02}\n\nThe **earned income tax credit (EITC)**{: data-type=\"term\"}, first passed in 1975, is a method of assisting the working poor through the tax system. The EITC is one of the largest assistance program for low-income groups, and projections for 2013 expected 26 million households to take advantage of it at an estimated cost of $50 billion. In 2013, for example, a single parent with two children would have received a tax credit of $5,372 up to an income level of $17,530. The amount of the tax break increases with the amount of income earned, up to a point. The earned income tax credit has often been popular with both economists and the general public because of the way it effectively increases the payment received for work.\n\nWhat about the danger of the poverty trap that every additional $1 earned will reduce government support payments by close to $1? To minimize this problem, the earned income tax credit is phased out slowly. According to the Tax Policy Center, for a single-parent family with two children in 2013, the credit is not reduced at all (but neither is it increased) as earnings rise from $13,430 to $17,530. Then, for every $1 earned above $17,530, the amount received from the credit is reduced by 21.06 cents, until the credit phases out completely at an income level of $46,227.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_007) illustrates that the earned income tax credits, child tax credits, and the TANF program all cost the federal government money\u2014either in direct outlays or in loss of tax revenues. **CTC**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} stands for the government tax cuts for the child tax credit.\n\n and TANF of over $20 billion and $10 billion, respectively. (Source: Office of Management and Budget)\"){: #CNX_Econ_C14_007 data-title=\"Real Federal Spending on CTC, EITC, and TANF, 1975-2013\"}\n\nIn recent years, the EITC has become a hugely expensive government program for providing income assistance to the poor and near-poor, costing about $60 billion in 2012. In that year, the EITC provided benefits to about 27 million families and individuals and, on average, is worth about $2,296 per family (with children), according to the Tax Policy Center. One reason that the TANF law worked as well as it did is that the EITC was greatly expanded in the late 1980s and again in the early 1990s, which increased the returns to work for low-income Americans.\n\n### Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)   {#ch14mod03_03}\n\nOften called \u201cfood stamps,\u201d **Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a federally funded program, started in 1964, in which each month poor people receive a card like a debit card that they can use to buy food. The amount of food aid for which a household is eligible varies by income, number of children, and other factors but, in general, households are expected to spend about 30% of their own net income on food, and if 30% of their net income is not enough to purchase a nutritionally adequate diet, then those households are eligible for SNAP.\n\nSNAP can contribute to the poverty trap. For every $100 earned, the government assumes that a family can spend $30 more for food, and thus reduces its eligibility for food aid by $30. This decreased benefit is not a complete disincentive to work\u2014but combined with how other programs reduce benefits as income increases, it adds to the problem. SNAP, however, does try to address the poverty trap with its own set of work requirements and time limits.\n\nWhy give debit cards and not just cash? Part of the political support for SNAP comes from a belief that since the cards must be spent on food, they cannot be \u201cwasted\u201d on other forms of consumption. From an economic point of view, however, the belief that cards must increase spending on food seems wrong-headed. After all, say that a poor family is spending $2,500 per year on food, and then it starts receiving $1,000 per year in SNAP aid. The family might react by spending $3,500 per year on food (income plus aid), or it might react by continuing to spend $2,500 per year on food, but use the $1,000 in food aid to free up $1,000 that can now be spent on other goods. So it is reasonable to think of SNAP cards as an alternative method, along with TANF and the earned income tax credit, of transferring income to the working poor.\n\nIndeed, anyone eligible for TANF is also eligible for SNAP, although states can expand eligibility for food aid if they wish to do so. In some states, where TANF welfare spending is relatively low, a poor family may receive more in support from SNAP than from TANF. In 2014, about 40 million people received food aid at an annual cost of about $76 billion, with an average monthly benefit of about $287 per person per month. SNAP participation increased by 70% between 2007 and 2011, from 26.6 million participants to 45 million. According to the Congressional Budget Office, this dramatic rise in participation was caused by the **Great Recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of 2008\u20132009 and rising food prices.\n\nThe federal government deploys a range of income security programs that are funded through departments such as Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (see [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_012)). According to the Office of Management and Budget, collectively, these three departments provided an estimated $62 billion of aid through programs such as supplemental feeding programs for women and children, subsidized housing, and energy assistance. The federal government also transfers funds to individual states through special grant programs.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C14_012 data-title=\"Expenditure Comparison of TANF, SNAP, HUD, and Other Income Security Programs, 1988&#x2013;2013 (est.)\"}\n\nThe safety net includes a number of other programs: government-subsidized school lunches and breakfasts for children from low-income families; the **Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which provides food assistance for pregnant women and newborns; the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which provides help with home heating bills; housing assistance, which helps pay the rent; and Supplemental Security Income, which provides cash support for the disabled and the elderly poor.\n\n### Medicaid   {#ch14mod03_04}\n\n**Medicaid**{: data-type=\"term\"} was created by Congress in 1965 and is a joint health insurance program entered into by both the states and the federal government. The federal government helps fund Medicaid, but each state is responsible for administering the program, determining the level of benefits, and determining eligibility. It provides medical insurance for certain low-income people, including those below the poverty line, with a focus on families with children, the elderly, and the disabled. About one-third of Medicaid spending is for low-income mothers with children. While an increasing share of the program funding in recent years has gone to pay for nursing home costs for the elderly poor. The program ensures that a basic level of benefits is provided to Medicaid participants, but because each state sets eligibility requirements and provides varying levels of service, the program differs from state to state.\n\nIn the past, a common problem has been that many low-paying jobs pay enough to a breadwinner so that a family could lose its eligibility for Medicaid, yet the job does not offer health insurance benefits. A poor parent considering such a job might choose not to work rather than lose health insurance for his or her children. In this way, health insurance can become a part of the poverty trap. Many states recognized this problem in the 1980s and 1990s and expanded their Medicaid coverage to include not just the poor, but the near-poor earning up to 135% or even 185% of the poverty line. Some states also guaranteed that children would not lose coverage if their parents worked.\n\nThese expanded guarantees cost the government money, of course, but they also helped to encourage those on welfare to enter the labor force. As of 2014, approximately 69.7 million people participated in Medicaid. Of those enrolled, almost half are children. Healthcare expenditures, however, are highest for the elderly population, which comprises approximately 25% of participants. As [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_008) (a) indicates, the largest number of households that enroll in Medicaid are those with children. Lower-income adults are the next largest group enrolled in Medicaid at 28%. The blind and disabled are 16% of those enrolled, and seniors are 9% of those enrolled. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_008) (b) shows how much actual Medicaid dollars are spent for each group. Out of total Medicaid spending, more is spent on seniors (20%) and the blind and disabled (44%). So, 64% of all Medicaid spending goes to seniors, the blind, and disabled. Children receive 21% of all Medicaid spending, followed by adults at 15%.\n\n shows the Medicaid enrollment by different populations, with children comprising the largest percentage at 47%, followed by adults at 28%, and the blind and disabled at 16%.

In the United States, prominent safety net programs include Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the earned income tax credit (EITC), Medicaid, and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch14mod03_sques}\n\n\n\nWe have discovered that the welfare system discourages recipients from working because the more income they earn, the less welfare benefits they receive. How does the earned income tax credit attempt to loosen the poverty trap?\n\n\n\nThe earned income tax credit works like this: a poor family receives a tax break that increases according to how much they work. Families that work more get more. In that sense it loosens the poverty trap by encouraging work. As families earn above the poverty level, the earned income tax credit is gradually reduced. For those near-poor families, the earned income tax credit is a partial disincentive to work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the TANF attempt to loosen the poverty trap?\n\n\n\nTANF attempts to loosen the poverty trap by providing incentives to work in other ways. Specifically, it requires that people work (or complete their education) as a condition of receiving TANF benefits, and it places a time limit on benefits.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch14mod03_rques}\n\n\n\nWho are the near-poor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the safety net?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBriefly explain the differences between TANF, the earned income tax credit, SNAP, and Medicaid.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#ch14mod03_ctques}\n\n\n\nMany critics of government programs to help low-income individuals argue that these programs create a poverty trap. Explain how programs such as TANF, EITC, SNAP, and Medicaid will affect low-income individuals and whether or not you think these programs will benefit families and children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about the business cycle: during a recession, unemployment increases; it decreases in an expansionary phase. Explain what happens to TANF, SNAP, and Medicaid programs at each phase of the business cycle (recession, trough, expansion, and peak).\n\n\n\n\n### References   {#ch14mod01_ref}\n\nCongressional Budget Office. 2015. \u201cThe Effects of Potential Cuts in SNAP Spending on Households With Different Amounts of Income.\u201d Accessed April 13, 2015. https://www.cbo.gov/publication/49978.\n\nFalk, Gene.

Income inequality, however, has to do with the distribution of that income, in terms of which group receives the most or the least income. Income inequality involves comparing those with high incomes, middle incomes, and low incomes\u2014not just looking at those below or near the poverty line. In turn, measuring income inequality means dividing up the population into various groups and then comparing the groups, a task that can be carried out in several ways, as the next Clear It Up feature shows.\n\n\n\nHow do you separate poverty and income inequality?\n\nPoverty can change even when inequality does not move at all. Imagine a situation in which income for everyone in the population declines by 10%. Poverty would rise, since a greater share of the population would now fall below the poverty line. However, inequality would be the same, because everyone suffered the same proportional loss. Conversely, a general rise in income levels over time would keep inequality the same, but reduce poverty.\n\nIt is also possible for income inequality to change without affecting the poverty rate. Imagine a situation in which a large number of people who already have high incomes increase their incomes by even more. Inequality would rise as a result\u2014but the number of people below the poverty line would remain unchanged.\n\n\n\nWhy did inequality of household income increase in the United States in recent decades? Indeed, a trend toward greater income inequality has occurred in many countries around the world, although the effect has been more powerful in the U.S. economy. Economists have focused their explanations for the increasing inequality on two factors that changed more or less continually from the 1970s into the 2000s. One set of explanations focuses on the changing shape of American households; the other focuses on greater inequality of wages, what some economists call \u201cwinner take all\u201d **labor markets**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. We will begin with how we measure inequality, and then consider the explanations for growing inequality in the United States.\n\n### Measuring Income Distribution by Quintiles   {#ch14mod04_01}\n\nOne common way of measuring income inequality is to rank all households by income, from lowest to highest, and then to divide all households into five groups with equal numbers of people, known as **quintiles**{: data-type=\"term\"}. This calculation allows for measuring the distribution of income among the five groups compared to the total. The first quintile is the lowest fifth or 20%, the second quintile is the next lowest, and so on. Income inequality can be measured by comparing what share of the total income is earned by each quintile.\n\nU.S. income distribution by quintile appears in [\\[link\\]](#ch14mod04_tab07). In 2011, for example, the bottom quintile of the income distribution received 3.2% of income; the second quintile received 8.4%; the third quintile, 14.3%; the fourth quintile, 23.0%; and the top quintile, 51.14%. The final column of [\\[link\\]](#ch14mod04_tab07) shows what share of income went to households in the top 5% of the income distribution: 22.3% in 2011. Over time, from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, the top fifth of the income distribution typically received between about 43% to 44% of all income. The share of income that the top fifth received then begins to rise. According to the Census Bureau, much of this increase in the share of income going to the top fifth can be traced to an increase in the share of income going to the top 5%. The quintile measure shows how income inequality has increased in recent decades.\n\n<table id=\"ch14mod04_tab07\" summary=\"This table has seven columns and five3 rows.

A more detailed breakdown can provide additional insights. For example, the last column of [\\[link\\]](#ch14mod04_tab07) shows the income received by the top 5% percent of the income distribution. Between 1980 and 2013, the share of income going to the top 5% increased by 5.7 percentage points (from 16.5% in 1980 to 22.2% in 2013). From 1980 to 2013 the share of income going to the top quintile increased by 7.0 percentage points (from 44.1% in 1980 to 51% in 2013). Thus, the top 20% of householders (the fifth quintile) received over half (51%) of all the income in the United States in 2013.\n\n### Lorenz Curve   {#ch14mod04_02}\n\nThe data on income inequality can be presented in various ways. For example, you could draw a bar graph that showed the share of income going to each fifth of the income distribution. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_004) presents an alternative way of showing inequality data in what is called a **Lorenz curve**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The Lorenz curve shows the cumulative share of population on the horizontal axis and the cumulative percentage of total income received on the vertical axis.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C14_004 data-title=\"The Lorenz Curve\"}\n\nEvery Lorenz curve diagram begins with a line sloping up at a 45-degree angle, shown as a dashed line in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_004). The points along this line show what perfect equality of the income distribution looks like. It would mean, for example, that the bottom 20% of the income distribution receives 20% of the total income, the bottom 40% gets 40% of total income, and so on. The other lines reflect actual U.S. data on inequality for 1980 and 2011.\n\nThe trick in graphing a Lorenz curve is that you must change the shares of income for each specific quintile, which are shown in the first column of numbers in [\\[link\\]](#ch14mod04_tab08), into cumulative income, shown in the second column of numbers. For example, the bottom 40% of the cumulative income distribution will be the sum of the first and second quintiles; the bottom 60% of the cumulative income distribution will be the sum of the first, second, and third quintiles, and so on. The final entry in the cumulative income column needs to be 100%, because by definition, 100% of the population receives 100% of the income.\n\n<table id=\"ch14mod04_tab08\" summary=\"This table has five columns and five rows.

The greater inequality of the U.S. income distribution between 1980 and 2013 is illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_004) because the Lorenz curve for 2013 is farther from the 45-degree line than the Lorenz curve for 1980.

The next Clear It Up feature shows how income inequality differs in various countries compared to the United States.\n\n\n\nHow does economic inequality vary around the world?\n\nThe U.S. economy has a relatively high degree of income inequality by global standards. As [\\[link\\]](#ch14mod04_tab09) shows, based on a variety of national surveys done for a selection of years in the last five years of the 2000s (with the exception of Germany, and adjusted to make the measures more comparable), the U.S. economy has greater inequality than Germany (along with most Western European countries). The region of the world with the highest level of income inequality is Latin America, illustrated in the numbers for Brazil and Mexico. The level of inequality in the United States is lower than in some of the low-income countries of the world, like China and Nigeria, or some middle-income countries like the Russian Federation. However, not all poor countries have highly unequal income distributions; India provides a counterexample.\n\n<table id=\"ch14mod04_tab09\" summary=\"This table has seven columns and eight rows.

One result of this trend is that more households have two earners. Moreover, it has become more common for one high earner to marry another high earner. A few decades ago, the common pattern featured a man with relatively high earnings, such as an executive or a doctor, marrying a woman who did not earn as much, like a secretary or a nurse. Often, the woman would leave paid employment, at least for a few years, to raise a family. However, now doctors are marrying doctors and executives are marrying executives, and mothers with high-powered careers are often returning to work while their children are quite young. This pattern of households with two high earners tends to increase the proportion of high-earning households.\n\nAccording to data in the National Journal, even as two-earner couples have increased, so have single-parent households. Of all U.S. families, 13.1% were headed by single mothers; the poverty rate among single-parent households tends to be relatively high.\n\nThese changes in family structure, including the growth of single-parent families who tend to be at the lower end of the income distribution, and the growth of two-career high-earner couples near the top end of the income distribution, account for roughly half of the rise in income inequality across households in recent decades.\n\n\nVisit this [website][2] to watch a video that illustrates the distribution of wealth in the United States.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch14mod04_qr02\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Causes of Growing Inequality: A Shift in the Distribution of Wages   {#ch14mod04_04}\n\nAnother factor behind the rise in U.S. income inequality is that earnings have become less equal since the late 1970s. In particular, the earnings of high-skilled labor relative to low-skilled labor have increased. Winner-take-all labor markets result from changes in technology, which have increased global demand for \u201cstars,\u201d\u2014whether the best CEO, doctor, basketball player, or actor. This global demand pushes salaries far above productivity differences versus educational differences. One way to measure this change is to take the earnings of workers with at least a four-year college bachelor\u2019s degree (including those who went on and completed an advanced degree) and divide them by the earnings of workers with only a high school degree. The result is that those in the 25\u201334 age bracket with college degrees earned about 1.67 times as much as high school graduates in 2010, up from 1.59 times in 1995, according to U.S. Census data. Winner-take-all labor market theory argues that the salary gap between the median and the top 1 percent is not due to educational differences.\n\nEconomists use the demand and supply model to reason through the most likely causes of this shift. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, in recent decades, the supply of U.S. workers with college degrees has increased substantially; for example, 840,000 four-year bachelor\u2019s degrees were conferred on Americans in 1970; in 2009\u20132010, 1,602,480 such degrees were conferred\u2014an increase of about 90%. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_006), this shift in supply to the right, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>, should result in a lower equilibrium wage for high-skilled labor. Thus, the increase in the price of high-skilled labor must be explained by a greater demand, like the movement from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. Evidently, combining both the increase in supply and in demand has resulted in a shift from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>, and a resulting higher wage.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C14_006 data-title=\"Why Would Wages Rise for High-Skilled Labor?\"}\n\nWhat factors would cause the demand for high-skilled labor to rise? The most plausible explanation is that while the explosion in new information and communications technologies over the last several decades has helped many workers to become more productive, the benefits have been especially great for high-skilled workers like top business managers, consultants, and design professionals. The new technologies have also helped to encourage **globalization**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the remarkable increase in international trade over the last few decades, by making it more possible to learn about and coordinate economic interactions all around the world. In turn, the rising impact of foreign trade in the U.S. economy has opened up greater opportunities for high-skilled workers to sell their services around the world. And lower-skilled workers have to compete with a larger supply of similarly skilled workers around the globe.\n\nThe market for high-skilled labor can be viewed as a race between forces of supply and demand. Additional education and on-the-job training will tend to increase the supply of high-skilled labor and to hold down its relative wage. Conversely, new technology and other economic trends like globalization tend to increase the demand for high-skilled labor and push up its relative wage. The greater inequality of wages can be viewed as a sign that demand for skilled labor is increasing faster than supply. On the other hand, if the supply of lower skilled workers exceeds the demand, then average wages in the lower quintiles of the income distribution will decrease. The combination of forces in the high-skilled and low-skilled labor markets leads to increased income disparity.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch14mod04_summ}\n\nMeasuring inequality involves making comparisons across the entire distribution of income, not just the poor. One way of doing this is to divide the population into groups, like quintiles, and then calculate what share of income is received by each group. An alternative approach is to draw Lorenz curves, which compare the cumulative income actually received to a perfectly equal distribution of income. Income inequality in the United States increased substantially from the late 1970s and early 1980s into the 2000s. The two most common explanations cited by economists are changes in the structure of households that have led to more two-earner couples and single-parent families, and the effect of new information and communications technology on wages.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch14mod04_sques}\n\n\n\nA group of 10 people have the following annual incomes: $24,000, $18,000, $50,000, $100,000, $12,000, $36,000, $80,000, $10,000, $24,000, $16,000. Calculate the share of total income received by each quintile of this income distribution. Do the top and bottom quintiles in this distribution have a greater or larger share of total income than the top and bottom quintiles of the U.S. income distribution?\n\n\n\nA useful first step is to rank the households by income, from lowest to highest. Then, since there are 10 households total, the bottom quintile will be the bottom two households, the second quintile will be the third and fourth households, and so on up to the top quintile. The quintiles and percentage of total income for the data provided are shown in the following table. Comparing this distribution to the U.S. income distribution for 2005, the top quintile in the example has a smaller share of total income than in the U.S. distribution and the bottom quintile has a larger share. This pattern usually means that the income distribution in the example is more equal than the U.S. distribution.\n\n<table id=\"ch14mod04_tab10\" summary=\"The table shows the quintiles and percentage of total income for the data provided in order to measure income inequality.

One reason is that technology can often substitute for low-wage labor in certain kinds of telephone or bookkeeping jobs. In addition, information technology makes it easier for companies to manage connections with low-wage workers in other countries, thus reducing the demand for low-wage workers in the United States. In the market for high-wage labor, information technology shifts the demand for high-wage labor to the right. By using the new information and communications technologies, high-wage labor can become more productive and can oversee more tasks than before.

{"module_id": "m48687", "module_title": "Economics - m48687", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48687", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Explain the arguments for and against government intervention in a market economy\n* Identify beneficial ways to reduce the economic inequality in a society\n* Show the tradeoff between incentives and income equality\n\n\n\nNo society should expect or desire complete equality of income at a given point in time, for a number of reasons. First, most workers receive relatively low earnings in their first few jobs, higher earnings as they reach middle age, and then lower earnings after retirement. Thus, a society with people of varying ages will have a certain amount of income inequality. Second, people\u2019s preferences and desires differ. Some are willing to work long hours to have income for large houses, fast cars and computers, luxury vacations, and the ability to support children and grandchildren.\n\nThese factors all imply that a snapshot of inequality in a given year does not provide an accurate picture of how people\u2019s incomes rise and fall over time. Even if some degree of economic inequality is expected at any point in time, how much inequality should there be? There is also the difference between income and wealth, as the following Clear It Up feature explains.\n\n\n\nHow do you measure wealth versus income inequality?\n\n**Income**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a flow of money received, often measured on a monthly or an annual basis; **wealth**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the sum of the value of all assets, including money in bank accounts, financial investments, a pension fund, and the value of a home. In calculating wealth all debts must be subtracted, such as debt owed on a home mortgage and on credit cards. A retired person, for example, may have relatively little income in a given year, other than a pension or Social Security. However, if that person has saved and invested over time, the person\u2019s accumulated wealth can be quite substantial.\n\nIn the United States, the wealth distribution is more unequal than the income distribution, because differences in income can accumulate over time to make even larger differences in wealth. However, the degree of inequality in the wealth distribution can be measured with the same tools we use to measure the inequality in the income distribution, like quintile measurements. Data on wealth are collected once every three years in the Survey of Consumer Finance.\n\n\n\nEven if they cannot answer the question of how much inequality is too much, economists can still play an important role in spelling out policy options and tradeoffs. If a society decides to reduce the level of economic inequality, it has three main sets of tools: redistribution from those with high incomes to those with low incomes; trying to assure that a ladder of opportunity is widely available; and a tax on inheritance.\n\n### Redistribution   {#ch14mod05_01}\n\n**Redistribution**{: data-type=\"term\"} means taking income from those with higher incomes and providing income to those with lower incomes. Earlier in this chapter, we considered some of the key government policies that provide support for the poor: the welfare program TANF, the earned income tax credit, SNAP, and Medicaid. If a reduction in inequality is desired, these programs could receive additional funding.\n\nThe programs are paid for through the federal income tax, which is a **progressive tax system**{: data-type=\"term\"} designed in such a way that the rich pay a higher percent in income taxes than the poor. Data from household income tax returns in 2009 shows that the top 1% of households had an average income of $1,219,700 per year in pre-tax income and paid an average federal tax rate of 28.9%. The **effective income tax**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is total taxes paid divided by total income (all sources of income such as wages, profits, interest, rental income, and government transfers such as veterans\u2019 benefits), was much lower. The effective tax paid by the top 1% of householders was 20.4%, while the bottom two quintiles actually paid negative effective income taxes, because of provisions like the earned income tax credit. News stories occasionally report on a high-income person who has managed to pay very little in taxes, but while such individual cases exist, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the typical pattern is that people with higher incomes pay a higher average share of their income in federal income taxes.\n\nOf course, the fact that some degree of redistribution occurs now through the federal income tax and government antipoverty programs does not settle the questions of how much redistribution is appropriate, and whether more redistribution should occur.\n\n### The Ladder of Opportunity   {#ch14mod05_02}\n\nEconomic inequality is perhaps most troubling when it is not the result of effort or talent, but instead is determined by the circumstances under which a child grows up. One child attends a well-run grade school and high school and heads on to college, while parents help out by supporting education and other interests, paying for college, a first car, and a first house, and offering work connections that lead to internships and jobs. Another child attends a poorly run grade school, barely makes it through a low-quality high school, does not go to college, and lacks family and peer support. These two children may be similar in their underlying talents and in the effort they put forth, but their economic outcomes are likely to be quite different.\n\n**Public policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} can attempt to build a ladder of opportunities so that, even though all children will never come from identical families and attend identical schools, each child has a reasonable opportunity to attain an economic niche in society based on their interests, desires, talents, and efforts. Some of those initiatives include those shown in [\\[link\\]](#ch14mod05_02_tab13).\n\n<table id=\"ch14mod05_02_tab13\" summary=\"The table shows some of the public policy initiatives available to children, college level students, and adults.

Although the general idea of a ladder of opportunity for all citizens continues to exert a powerful attraction, specifics are often quite controversial. Society can experiment with a wide variety of proposals for building a ladder of opportunity, especially for those who otherwise seem likely to start their lives in a disadvantaged position. Such policy experiments need to be carried out in a spirit of open-mindedness, because some will succeed while others will not show positive results or will cost too much to enact on a widespread basis.\n\n### Inheritance Taxes   {#ch14mod05_03}\n\nThere is always a debate about inheritance taxes. It goes like this: On the one hand, why should people who have worked hard all their lives and saved up a substantial nest egg not be able to give their money and possessions to their children and grandchildren? In particular, it would seem un-American if children were unable to inherit a family business or a family home. On the other hand, many Americans are far more comfortable with inequality resulting from high-income people who earned their money by starting innovative new companies than they are with inequality resulting from high-income people who have inherited money from rich parents.\n\nThe United States does have an **estate tax**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014that is, a tax imposed on the value of an inheritance\u2014which suggests a willingness to limit how much wealth can be passed on as an inheritance. However, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, in 2015 the estate tax applied only to those leaving inheritances of more than $5.43 million and thus applies to only a tiny percentage of those with high levels of wealth.\n\n### The Tradeoff between Incentives and Income Equality   {#ch14mod05_04}\n\nGovernment policies to reduce poverty or to encourage economic equality, if carried to extremes, can injure incentives for economic output. The poverty trap, for example, defines a situation where guaranteeing a certain level of income can eliminate or reduce the incentive to work. An extremely high degree of redistribution, with very high taxes on the rich, would be likely to discourage work and entrepreneurship. Thus, it is common to draw the tradeoff between economic output and equality, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_009) (a). In this formulation, if society wishes a high level of economic output, like point A, it must also accept a high degree of inequality. Conversely, if society wants a high level of equality, like point B, it must accept a lower level of economic output because of reduced incentives for production.\n\nThis view of the tradeoff between economic output and equality may be too pessimistic, and [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_009) (b) presents an alternate vision. Here, the tradeoff between economic output and equality first slopes up, in the vicinity of choice C, suggesting that certain programs might increase both output and economic equality. For example, the policy of providing free public education has an element of redistribution, since the value of the public schooling received by children of low-income families is clearly higher than what low-income families pay in taxes. A well-educated population, however, is also an enormously powerful factor in providing the skilled workers of tomorrow and helping the economy to grow and expand. In this case, equality and economic growth may complement each other.\n\nMoreover, policies to diminish inequality and soften the hardship of poverty may sustain political support for a market economy. After all, if society does not make some effort toward reducing inequality and poverty, the alternative might be that people would rebel against market forces. Citizens might seek economic security by demanding that their legislators pass laws forbidding employers from ever laying off workers or reducing wages, or laws that would impose price floors and price ceilings and shut off international trade. From this viewpoint, policies to reduce inequality may help economic output by building social support for allowing markets to operate.\n\n  Society faces a trade-off where any attempt to move toward greater equality, like moving from choice A to B, involves a reduction in economic output. (b) Situations can arise like point C, where it is possible both to increase equality and also to increase economic output, to a choice like D. It may also be possible to increase equality with little impact on economic output, like the movement from choice D to E. However, at some point, too aggressive a push for equality will tend to reduce economic output, as in the shift from E to F.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C14_009 data-title=\"The Tradeoff between Incentives and Economic Equality\"}\n\nThe tradeoff in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C14_009) (b) then flattens out in the area between points D and E, which reflects the pattern that a number of countries that provide similar levels of income to their citizens\u2014the United States, Canada, the nations of the European Union, Japan, Australia\u2014have different levels of inequality. The pattern suggests that countries in this range could choose a greater or a lesser degree of inequality without much impact on economic output. Only if these countries push for a much higher level of equality, like at point F, will they experience the diminished incentives that lead to lower levels of economic output. In this view, while a danger always exists that an agenda to reduce poverty or inequality can be poorly designed or pushed too far, it is also possible to discover and design policies that improve equality and do not injure incentives for economic output by very much\u2014or even improve such incentives.\n\n\n\nOccupy Wall Street\n\nThe Occupy movement took on a life of its own over the last few months of 2011, bringing to light issues faced by many people on the lower end of the income distribution. The contents of this chapter indicate that there is a significant amount of income inequality in the United States. The question is: What should be done about it?\n\nThe Great Recession of 2008\u20132009 caused unemployment to rise and incomes to fall. Many people attribute the recession to mismanagement of the financial system by bankers and financial managers\u2014those in the 1% of the income distribution\u2014but those in lower quintiles bore the greater burden of the recession through unemployment. This seemed to present the picture of inequality in a different light: the group that seemed responsible for the recession was not the group that seemed to bear the burden of the decline in output. A burden shared can bring a society closer together; a burden pushed off onto others can polarize it.\n\nOn one level, the problem with trying to reduce income inequality comes down to whether you still believe in the American Dream. If you believe that one day you will have your American Dream\u2014a large income, large house, happy family, or whatever else you would like to have in life\u2014then you do not necessarily want to prevent anyone else from living out their dream. You certainly would not want to run the risk that someone would want to take part of your dream away from you. So there is some reluctance to engage in a redistributive policy to reduce inequality.\n\nHowever, when those for whom the likelihood of living the American Dream is very small are considered, there are sound arguments in favor of trying to create greater balance. As the text indicated, a little more income equality, gained through long-term programs like increased education and job training, can increase overall economic output. Then everyone is made better off. And the 1% will not seem like such a small group any more.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch14mod05_summ}\n\nPolicies that can affect the level of economic inequality include redistribution between rich and poor, making it easier for people to climb the ladder of opportunity; and estate taxes, which are taxes on inheritances. Pushing too aggressively for economic equality can run the risk of decreasing economic incentives. However, a moderate push for economic equality can increase economic output, both through methods like improved education and by building a base of political support for market forces.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch14mod05_sques}\n\n\n\nHere is one hypothesis: A well-funded social safety net can increase economic equality but will reduce economic output. Explain why this might be so, and sketch a production possibility curve that shows this tradeoff.\n\n\n\nA very strong push for economic equality might include extremely high taxes on high-wage earners to pay for extremely large government social payments for the poor. Such a policy could limit incentives for the high-wage workers, lock the poor into a poverty trap, and thus reduce output. The PPF in this case will have the standard appearance: it will be downward sloping.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a second hypothesis: A well-funded social safety net may lead to less regulation of the market economy. Explain why this might be so, and sketch a production possibility curve that shows this tradeoff.\n\n\n\nFor the second hypothesis, a well-funded social safety net might make people feel that even if their company goes bankrupt or they need to change jobs or industries, they will have some degree of protection. As a result, people may be more willing to allow markets to work without interference, and not to lobby as hard for rules that would prevent layoffs, set price controls, or block foreign trade. In this case, safety net programs that increase equality could also allow the market to work more freely in a way that could increase output. In this case, at least some portion of the PPF between equality and economic output would slope up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich set of policies is more likely to cause a tradeoff between economic output and equality: policies of redistribution or policies aimed at the ladder of opportunity? Explain how the production possibility frontier tradeoff between economic equality and output might look in each case.\n\n\n\nPure redistribution is more likely to cause a sharp tradeoff between economic output and equality than policies aimed at the ladder of opportunity. A production possibility frontier showing a strict tradeoff between economic output and equality will be downward sloping. A PPF showing that it is possible to increase equality, at least to some extent, while either increasing output or at least not diminishing it would have a PPF that first rises, perhaps has a flat area, and then falls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is there reluctance on the part of some in the United States to redistribute income so that greater equality can be achieved?\n\n\n\nMany view the redistribution of income to achieve greater equality as taking away from the rich to pay the poor, or as a \u201czero sum\u201d game. By taking taxes from one group of people and redistributing them to another, the tax system is robbing some of the American Dream.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch14mod05_rques}\n\n\n\nIdentify some public policies that can reduce the level of economic inequality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how a push for economic equality might reduce incentives to work and produce output.

The newly elected Wisconsin governor, Scott Walker, supported a bill proposed by Republican state legislators that would have effectively eliminated most collective bargaining rights of public sector union employees.\n\nCollective bargaining laws require employers to sit down and negotiate with the representative union of their employees. The governor argued that the state needed to close a multi-billion-dollar deficit, so legislators proposed a Budget Repair Act that would eliminate collective bargaining over everything but wages. The bill passed and was signed into law after a significant level of drama that saw Democratic legislators leaving the state so that there would not be enough legislators in house to continue the debate or bring the bill to a vote. The law proved so unpopular that Governor Walker faced a recall vote in 2012. The recall attempt was defeated, but the law has been subjected to numerous court reviews. The discussion about the role of collective bargaining is not over.\n\nWhy was a bill like this proposed? Are collective bargaining rights necessary for public sector employees? How would an economist respond to such a bill? This chapter lays out the changing role of unions in U.S. labor markets.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Issues in Labor Markets: Unions, Discrimination, Immigration\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Labor Unions\n* Employment Discrimination\n* Immigration\n\n\n\nWhen a job applicant is bargaining with an employer for a position, the applicant is often at a disadvantage\u2014needing the job more than the employer needs that particular applicant. John Bates Clark (1847\u20131938), often named as the first great American economist, wrote in 1907: \u201cIn the making of the wages contract the individual laborer is always at a disadvantage. He has something which he is obliged to sell and which his employer is not obliged to take, since he \\[that is, the employer\\] can reject single men with impunity.\u201d\n\nTo give workers more power, the U.S. government has passed, in response to years of labor protests, a number of laws to create a more equal balance of power between workers and employers. These laws include some of the following:\n\n* Setting minimum hourly wages\n* Setting maximum hours of work (at least before employers pay overtime rates)\n* Prohibiting child labor\n* Regulating health and safety conditions in the workplace\n* Preventing discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and age\n* Requiring employers to provide family leave\n* Requiring employers to give advance notice of layoffs\n* Covering workers with unemployment insurance\n* Setting a limit on the number of immigrant workers from other countries\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_15_01) lists some prominent U.S. workplace protection laws. Many of the laws listed in the table were only the start of labor market regulations in these areas and have been followed, over time, by other related laws, regulations, and court rulings.\n\n<table id=\"Table_15_01\" summary=\"The table shows some of the prominent U.S. workplace protection laws.

A labor union seeks to change the balance of power between employers and workers by requiring employers to deal with workers collectively, rather than as individuals. Thus, negotiations between unions and firms are sometimes called **collective bargaining**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nThe subject of labor unions can be controversial. Supporters of labor unions view them as the workers\u2019 primary line of defense against efforts by profit-seeking firms to hold down wages and benefits. Critics of labor unions view them as having a tendency to grab as much as they can in the short term, even if it means injuring workers in the long run by driving firms into bankruptcy or by blocking the new technologies and production methods that lead to economic growth. We will start with some facts about union membership in the United States.\n\n### Facts about Union Membership and Pay\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics, about 11.1% of all U.S. workers belong to unions. Following are some of the facts provided by the bureau for 2014:\n\n* 12\\.0% of U.S. male workers belong to unions; 10.5% of female workers do\n* 11\\.1% of white workers, 13.4 % of black workers, and 9.8 % of Hispanic workers belong to unions\n* 12\\.5% of full-time workers and 6.0% of part-time workers are union members\n* 4\\.2% of workers ages 16\u201324 belong to unions, as do 14% of workers ages 45-54\n* Occupations in which relatively high percentages of workers belong to unions are the federal government (26.9% belong to a union), state government (31.3%), local government (41.7%); transportation and utilities (20.6%); natural resources, construction, and maintenance (16.3%); and production, transportation, and material moving (14.7%)\n* Occupations that have relatively low percentages of unionized workers are agricultural workers (1.4%), financial services (1.1%), professional and business services (2.4%), leisure and hospitality (2.7%), and wholesale and retail trade (4.7%)\n\nIn summary, the percentage of workers belonging to a union is higher for men than women; higher for blacks than for whites or Hispanics; higher for the 45\u201364 age range; and higher among workers in government and manufacturing than workers in agriculture or service-oriented jobs.

The good news for unions and their members is that their members earn about 20% more than nonunion workers, even after adjusting for factors such as years of work experience and education level. The bad news for unions is that the share of U.S. workers who belong to a labor union has been steadily declining for 50 years, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C15_003). About one-quarter of all U.S. workers belonged to a union in the mid-1950s, but only 11.1% of U.S. workers are union members today. If you leave out workers employed by the government (which includes teachers in public schools), only 6.6% of the workers employed by private firms now work for a union.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C15_003 data-title=\"Percentage of Wage and Salary Workers Who Are Union Members \"}\n\nThe following section analyzes the higher pay union workers receive compared the pay rates for nonunion workers. The following section analyzes declining union membership levels. An overview of these two issues will allow us to discuss many aspects of how unions work.\n\n### Higher Wages for Union Workers\n\nWhy might union workers receive higher pay? What are the limits on how much higher pay they can receive? To analyze these questions, let\u2019s consider a situation where all firms in an industry must negotiate with a single union, and no **firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is allowed to hire nonunion labor. If no labor union existed in this market, then equilibrium (E) in the labor market would occur at the intersection of the demand for labor (D) and the supply of labor (S) in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C15_004). The union can, however, threaten that, unless firms agree to the wages they demand, the workers will strike. As a result, the labor union manages to achieve, through negotiations with the firms, a union wage of Wu for its members, above what the equilibrium wage would otherwise have been.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C15_004 data-title=\"Union Wage Negotiations \"}\n\nThis labor market situation resembles what a **monopoly firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} does in selling a product, but in this case a union is a monopoly selling labor to firms. At the higher union wage Wu, the firms in this industry will hire less labor than they would have hired in equilibrium. Moreover, an excess supply of workers want union jobs, but firms will not be hiring for such jobs.\n\nFrom the union point of view, workers who receive higher wages are better off. However, notice that the quantity of workers (Qd) hired at the union wage Wu is smaller than the quantity Qe that would have been hired at the original equilibrium wage. A sensible union must recognize that when it pushes up the wage, it also reduces the incentive of firms to hire. This situation does not necessarily mean that union workers are fired. Instead, it may be that when union workers move on to other jobs or retire, they are not always replaced. Or perhaps when a firm expands production, it expands employment somewhat less with a higher union wage than it would have done with the lower equilibrium wage. Or perhaps a firm decides to purchase inputs from nonunion producers, rather than producing them with its own highly paid unionized workers. Or perhaps the firm moves or opens a new facility in a state or country where unions are less powerful.\n\nFrom the firm\u2019s point of view, the key question is whether the higher wage of union workers is matched by higher productivity. If so, then the firm can afford to pay the higher union wages and, indeed, the demand curve for \u201cunionized\u201d labor could actually shift to the right. This could reduce the job losses as the equilibrium employment level shifts to the right and the difference between the equilibrium and the union wages will have been reduced. If worker unionization does not increase productivity, then the higher union wage will cause lower profits or losses for the firm.\n\nUnion workers might have higher productivity than nonunion workers for a number of reasons. First, higher wages may elicit higher productivity. Second, union workers tend to stay longer at a given job, a trend that reduces the employer\u2019s costs for training and hiring and results in workers with more years of experience. Many unions also offer job training and apprenticeship programs.\n\nIn addition, firms that are confronted with union demands for higher wages may choose production methods that involve more physical capital and less labor, resulting in increased labor productivity. [\\[link\\]](#Table_15_03) provides an example. Assume that a firm can produce a home exercise cycle with three different combinations of labor and manufacturing equipment. Say that labor is paid $16 an hour (including benefits) and the machines for manufacturing cost $200 each. Under these circumstances, the total cost of producing a home exercise cycle will be lowest if the firm adopts the plan of 50 hours of labor and one machine, as the table shows. Now, suppose that a union negotiates a wage of $20 an hour including benefits. In this case, it makes no difference to the firm whether it uses more hours of labor and fewer machines or less labor and more machines, though it might prefer to use more machines and to hire fewer union workers. (After all, machines never threaten to strike\u2014but they do not buy the final product or service either.) In the final column of the table, the wage has risen to $24 an hour. In this case, the firm clearly has an incentive for using the plan that involves paying for fewer hours of labor and using three machines. If management responds to union demands for higher wages by investing more in machinery, then union workers can be more productive because they are working with more or better physical capital equipment than the typical nonunion worker. However, the firm will need to hire fewer workers.\n\n<table id=\"Table_15_03\" summary=\"The table shows an example of three production choices for manufacturing a home exercise cycle. Column 1 lists the Hours of Labor. Column 2 lists the Number of Machines. Column 3 lists the Cost of Labor + Cost of Machine ($16/hour). Column 4 lists the Cost of Labor + Cost of Machine ($20/hour).

For example, in 2002, the union representing longshoremen who unload ships and the firms that operate shipping companies and port facilities staged a work stoppage that shut down the ports on the western coast of the United States. Two key issues in the dispute were the desire of the shipping companies and port operators to use handheld scanners for record-keeping and computer-operated cabs for loading and unloading ships\u2014changes which the union opposed, along with overtime pay. President Obama threatened to use the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947\u2014commonly known as the **Taft-Hartley Act**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\u2014where a court can impose an 80-day \u201ccooling-off period\u201d in order to allow time for negotiations to proceed without the threat of a work stoppage. Federal mediators were called in, and the two sides agreed to a deal in February 2015. The ultimate agreement allowed the new technologies, but also kept wages, health, and pension benefits high for workers. In the past, presidential use of the Taft-Hartley Act sometimes has made labor negotiations more bitter and argumentative but, in this case, it seems to have smoothed the road to an agreement.\n\nIn other instances, unions have proved quite willing to adopt new technologies. In one prominent example, during the 1950s and 1960s, the **United Mineworkers union**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} demanded that mining companies install labor-saving machinery in the mines. The mineworkers\u2019 union realized that over time, the new machines would reduce the number of jobs in the mines, but the union leaders also knew that the mine owners would have to pay higher wages if the workers became more productive, and mechanization was a necessary step toward greater productivity.\n\nIn fact, in some cases union workers may be more willing to accept new technology than nonunion workers, because the union workers believe that the union will negotiate to protect their jobs and wages, whereas nonunion workers may be more concerned that the new technology will replace their jobs. In addition, union workers, who typically have higher job market experience and training, are likely to suffer less and benefit more than non-union workers from the introduction of new technology. Overall, it is hard to make a definitive case that union workers as a group are always either more or less welcoming to new technology than are nonunion workers.\n\n### The Decline in U.S. Union Membership\n\nThe proportion of U.S. workers belonging to unions has declined dramatically since the early 1950s. Economists have offered a number of possible explanations:\n\n* The shift from manufacturing to service industries\n* The force of globalization and increased competition from foreign producers\n* A reduced desire for unions because of the workplace protection laws now in place\n* U.S. legal environment that makes it relatively more difficult for unions to organize workers and expand their membership\n\nLet\u2019s discuss each of these four explanations in more detail.\n\nA first possible explanation for the decline in the share of U.S. workers belonging to unions involves the patterns of job growth in the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C15_005). The U.S. economy had about 15 million manufacturing jobs in 1960. This total rose to 19 million by the late 1970s and then declined to 17 million in 2013. Meanwhile, the number of jobs in service industries and in government combined rose from 35 million in 1960 to over 118 million by 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because over time unions were stronger in manufacturing than in service industries, the growth in jobs was not happening where the unions were. It is interesting to note that several of the biggest unions in the country are made up of government workers, including the **American Federation of State**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, **County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}; the **Service Employees International Union**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}; and the **National Education Association**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. The membership of each of these unions is listed in [\\[link\\]](#Table_15_02). Outside of government employees, however, unions have not had great success in organizing the service sector.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C15_005 data-title=\"The Growth of Service Jobs \"}\n\nA second explanation for the decline in the share of unionized workers looks at import competition. Starting in the 1960s, U.S. carmakers and steelmakers faced increasing competition from Japanese and European manufacturers. As sales of imported cars and steel rose, the number of jobs in U.S. auto manufacturing fell. This industry is heavily unionized. Not surprisingly, membership in the United Auto Workers, which was 975,000 in 1985, had fallen to roughly 390,000 by 2015. Import competition not only decreases the employment in sectors where unions were once strong, but also decreases the bargaining power of unions in those sectors. However, as we have seen, unions that organize public-sector workers, who are not threatened by import competition, have continued to see growth.\n\nA third possible reason for the decline in the number of union workers is that citizens often call on their elected representatives to pass laws concerning work conditions, overtime, parental leave, regulation of pensions, and other issues. Unions offered strong political support for these laws aimed at protecting workers but, in an ironic twist, the passage of those laws then made many workers feel less need for unions.\n\nThese first three possible reasons for the decline of unions are all somewhat plausible, but they have a common problem. Most other developed economies have experienced similar economic and political trends, such as the shift from manufacturing to services, globalization, and increasing government social benefits and regulation of the workplace. Clearly there are cultural differences between countries as to their acceptance of unions in the workplace. The share of the population belonging to unions in other countries is very high compared with the share in the United States. [\\[link\\]](#Table_15_04) shows the proportion of workers in a number of the world\u2019s high-income economies who belong to unions. The United States is near the bottom, along with France and Spain. The last column shows union coverage, defined as including those workers whose wages are determined by a union negotiation even if the workers do not officially belong to the union. In the United States, union membership is almost identical to union coverage. However, in many countries, the wages of many workers who do not officially belong to a union are still determined by collective bargaining between unions and firms.\n\n<table id=\"Table_15_04\" summary=\"This table has three columns and nine rows.

The close connection between union membership and a friendly legal environment is apparent in the history of U.S. unions. The great rise in union membership in the 1930s followed the passage of the **National Labor-Management Relations Act**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of 1935, which specified that workers had a right to organize unions and that management had to give them a fair chance to do so. The U.S. government strongly encouraged the formation of unions during the early 1940s in the belief that unions would help to coordinate the all-out production efforts needed during World War II. However, after World War II came the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which gave states the power to allow workers to opt out of the union in their workplace if they so desired. This law made the legal climate less encouraging to those seeking to form unions, and union membership levels soon started declining.\n\nThe procedures for forming a union differ substantially from country to country. For example, the procedures in the United States and those in Canada are strikingly different. When a group of workers wish to form a union in the United States, they announce this fact and an election date is set when the employees at a firm will vote in a secret ballot on whether to form a union. Supporters of the union lobby for a \u201cyes\u201d vote, and the management of the firm lobbies for a \u201cno\u201d vote\u2014often even hiring outside consultants for assistance in swaying workers to vote \u201cno.\u201d In Canada, by contrast, a union is formed when a sufficient proportion of workers (usually about 60%) sign an official card saying that they want a union. There is no separate \u201celection date.\u201d The management of Canadian firms is limited by law in its ability to lobby against the union. In addition, though it is illegal to discriminate and fire workers based on their union activity in the United States, the penalties are slight, making this a not so costly way of deterring union activity. In short, forming unions is easier in Canada\u2014and in many other countries\u2014than in the United States.\n\nIn summary, union membership in the United States is lower than in many other high-income countries, a difference that may be due to different legal environments and cultural attitudes toward unions.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read about recent protests regarding minimum wage for fast food employees.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA labor union is an organization of workers that negotiates as a group with employers over compensation and work conditions. Union workers in the United States are paid more on average than other workers with comparable education and experience. Thus, either union workers must be more productive to match this higher pay or the higher pay will lead employers to find ways of hiring fewer union workers than they otherwise would. American union membership has been falling for decades. Some possible reasons include the shift of jobs to service industries; greater competition from globalization; the passage of worker-friendly legislation; and U.S. laws that are less favorable to organizing unions.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\n[[link]](#Table_15_05) shows the quantity demanded and supplied in the labor market for driving city buses in the town of Unionville, where all the bus drivers belong to a union.\n\n<table id=\"Table_15_05\" summary=\"The table shows the quantity demanded and supplied in the labor market for driving city buses in the town of Unionville, where all the bus drivers belong to a union.

What would the equilibrium wage and quantity be in this market if no union existed?\n2.  Assume that the union has enough negotiating power to raise the wage to $4 per hour higher than it would otherwise be. Is there now excess demand or excess supply of labor?\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  With no union, the equilibrium wage rate would be $18 per hour and there would be 8,000 bus drivers.\n2.  If the union has enough negotiating power to raise the wage to $4 per hour higher than under the original equilibrium, the new wage would be $22 per hour. At this wage, 4,000 workers would be demanded while 10,000 would be supplied, leading to an excess supply of 6,000 workers.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo unions typically oppose new technology out of a fear that it will reduce the number of union jobs? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nUnions have sometimes opposed new technology out of a fear of losing jobs, but in other cases unions have helped to facilitate the introduction of new technology because unionized workers felt that the union was looking after their interests or that their higher skills meant that their jobs were essentially protected. And the new technologies meant increased productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared with the share of workers in most other high-income countries, is the share of U.S. workers whose wages are determined by union bargaining higher or lower? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nIn a few other countries (such as France and Spain), the percentage of workers belonging to a union is similar to that in the United States. Union membership rates, however, are generally lower in the United States. When the share of workers whose wages are determined by union negotiations is considered, the United States ranks by far the lowest (because in countries like France and Spain, union negotiations often determine pay even for nonunion employees).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre firms with a high percentage of union employees more likely to go bankrupt because of the higher wages that they pay? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nNo. While some unions may cause firms to go bankrupt, other unions help firms to become more competitive. No overall pattern exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo countries with a higher percentage of unionized workers usually have less growth in productivity because of strikes and other disruptions caused by the unions? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nFrom a social point of view, the benefits of unions and the costs seem to counterbalance. There is no evidence that in countries with a higher percentage of unionized workers, the economies grow more or less slowly.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is a labor union?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do employers have a natural advantage in bargaining with employees?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the most important laws that protect employee rights?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the presence of a labor union change negotiations between employers and workers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the long-term trend in American union membership?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you expect the presence of labor unions to lead to higher or lower pay for worker-members?

There are many types of discrimination but the focus here will be on discrimination in labor markets, which arises if workers with the same skill levels\u2014as measured by education, experience, and expertise\u2014receive different pay receive different pay or have different job opportunities because of their race or gender.\n\n### Earnings Gaps by Race and Gender\n\nA possible signal of labor market discrimination is when one group is paid less than another. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C15_001) shows the average wage of black workers as a ratio of the average wage of white workers and the average wage of female workers as a ratio of the average wage of male workers. Research by the economists **Francine Blau**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **Laurence Kahn**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} shows that the gap between the earnings of women and men did not move much in the 1970s, but has declined since the 1980s. According to the U.S. Census, the gap between the earnings of blacks and whites diminished in the 1970s, but has not changed in 50 years. In both gender and race, an earnings gap remains.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C15_001 data-title=\"Wage Ratios by Sex and Race \"}\n\nAn earnings gap between average wages, in and of itself, does not prove that discrimination is occurring in the labor market. We need to apply the same productivity characteristics to all parties (employees) involved. Gender discrimination in the labor market occurs when women are paid less than men despite having comparable levels of education, experience, and expertise. (Read the Clear It Up about the sex-discrimination suit brought against Wal-Mart.) Similarly, racial discrimination in the labor market exists when racially diverse employees are paid less than their coworkers of the majority race despite having comparable levels of education, experience, and expertise. To bring a successful gender discrimination lawsuit, a female employee must prove that she is paid less than a male employee who holds a similar job, with similar educational attainment, and with similar expertise. Likewise, someone who wants to sue on the grounds of racial discrimination must prove that he or she is paid less than an employee of another race who holds a similar job, with similar educational attainment, and with similar expertise.\n\n\n\nWhat was the sex-discrimination case against Wal-Mart?\n\nIn one of the largest class-action sex-discrimination cases in U.S. history, 1.2 million female employees of Wal-Mart claimed that the company engaged in wage and promotion discrimination. In 2011, the Supreme Court threw out the case on the grounds that the group was too large and too diverse for the case to be considered a class action suit. Lawyers for the women regrouped and are now suing in smaller groups. Part of the difficulty for the female employees is that the court said that pay and promotion decisions were made by local managers and were not necessarily policies of the company as a whole. Consequently, female Wal-Mart employees in Texas are arguing that their new suit will challenge the management of a \u201cdiscrete group of regional district and store managers.\u201d They claim these managers made biased pay and promotion decisions. However, in 2013, a smaller California class action suit against the company was again rejected by a federal district court.\n\nOn other issues, Wal-Mart made the news again in 2013 when the National Labor Relations Board found Wal-Mart guilty of illegally penalizing and firing workers who took part in labor protests and strikes. Wal-Mart has already paid $11.7 million in back wages and compensation damages to women in Kentucky who were denied jobs due to their sex.\n\n\n\n### Investigating the Female/Male Earnings Gap\n\nAs a result of changes in law and culture, women began to enter the paid workforce in substantial numbers in the mid- to late-twentieth century. By 2014, 58.1% of adult women held jobs while 72.0% of adult men did. Moreover, along with entering the workforce, women began to ratchet up their education levels. In 1971, 44% of undergraduate college degrees went to women; by 2014, women received 56% of bachelor\u2019s degrees. In 1970, women received 5.4% of the degrees from law schools and 8.4% of the degrees from medical schools. By 2014, women were receiving 47% of the law degrees and 48.0% of the medical degrees. These gains in education and experience have reduced the female/male wage gap over time. However, concerns remain about the extent to which women have not yet assumed a substantial share of the positions at the top of the largest companies or in the U.S. Congress.\n\nThere are factors that can lower women\u2019s average wages. Women are likely to bear a disproportionately large share of household responsibilities. A mother of young children is more likely to drop out of the labor force for several years or work on a reduced schedule than is the father. As a result, women in their 30s and 40s are likely, on average, to have less job experience than men. In the United States, childless women with the same education and experience levels as men are typically paid comparably. However, women with families and children are typically paid about 7% to 14% less than other women of similar education and work experience. (Meanwhile, married men earn about 10% to 15% more than single men with comparable education and work experience.)\n\nThe different patterns of family responsibilities possibly could be called discrimination, but it is primarily rooted in America\u2019s social patterns of discrimination, which involve the roles that fathers and mothers play in child-rearing, rather than discrimination by employers in hiring and salary decisions.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read more about the persistently low numbers of women in executive roles in business and in the U.S. Congress.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Investigating the Black/White Earnings Gap\n\nBlacks experienced blatant labor market discrimination during much of the twentieth century. Until the passage of the **Civil Rights Act of 1964**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, it was legal in many states to refuse to hire a black worker, regardless of the credentials or experience of that worker. Moreover, blacks were often denied access to educational opportunities, which in turn meant that they had lower levels of qualifications for many jobs. At least one economic study has shown that the 1964 law is partially responsible for the narrowing of the gap in black\u2013white earnings in the late 1960s and into the 1970s; for example, the ratio of total earnings of black male workers to white male workers rose from 62% in 1964 to 75.3% in 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHowever, the earnings gap between black and white workers has not changed as much as the earnings gap between men and women has in the last half century. The remaining racial gap seems related both to continuing differences in education levels and to the presence of discrimination. [\\[link\\]](#Table_15_06) shows that the percentage of blacks who complete a four-year college degree remains substantially lower than the percentage of whites who complete college. According to the U.S. Census, both whites and blacks have higher levels of educational attainment than Hispanics and lower levels than Asians. The lower average levels of education for black workers surely explain part of the earnings gap. In fact, black women who have the same levels of education and experience as white women receive, on average, about the same level of pay. One study shows that white and black college graduates have identical salaries immediately after college; however, the racial wage gap widens over time, an outcome that suggests the possibility of continuing discrimination. Another study conducted a field experiment by responding to job advertisements with fictitious resumes with either very African American sounding names or very white sounding names and found out that white names received 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. This is suggestive of discrimination in job opportunities. Further, as the following Clear It Up feature explains, there is evidence to support that discrimination in the housing market is connected to employment discrimination.\n\n<table id=\"Table_15_06\" summary=\"This table has five columns and two rows. The first row is a header row and it labels the last four columns, 'White,' 'Hispanic,' 'Black,' and 'Asian.'

Asians are shown 19 percent fewer properties. Additionally, Hispanics experience more discrimination in renting apartments and undergo stiffer credit checks than white renters. In a 2012 study conducted by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the nonprofit Urban Institute, Hispanic testers who contacted agents about advertised rental units were given information about 12 percent fewer units available and were shown seven percent fewer units than white renters. The $9 million study, based on research in 28 metropolitan areas, concluded that blatant \u201cdoor slamming\u201d forms of discrimination are on the decline but that the discrimination that does exist is harder to detect, and as a result, more difficult to remedy. According to the *Chicago Tribune*, HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan told reporters, \u201cJust because it\u2019s taken on a hidden form doesn\u2019t make it any less harmful. You might not be able to move into that community with the good schools.\u201d\n\nThe lower levels of education for black workers can also be a result of discrimination\u2014although it may be pre-labor market discrimination, rather than direct discrimination by employers in the labor market. For example, if discrimination in housing markets causes black families to live clustered together in certain poorer neighborhoods, then the black children will continue to have lower educational attainment then their white counterparts and, consequently, not be able to obtain the higher paying jobs that require higher levels of education. Another element to consider is that in the past, when blacks were effectively barred from many high-paying jobs, getting additional education could have seemed somewhat pointless, because the educational degrees would not pay off. Even though labor market discrimination has been legally abolished, it can take some time to establish a culture and a tradition of valuing education highly. Additionally, a legacy of past discrimination may contribute to an attitude that blacks will have a difficult time succeeding in academic subjects. In any case, the impact of social discrimination in labor markets is more complicated than seeking to punish a few bigoted employers.\n\n\n\n### Competitive Markets and Discrimination\n\n**Gary Becker**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (b. 1930), who won the Nobel Prize in economics in 1992, was one of the first to analyze discrimination in economic terms. Becker pointed out that while competitive markets can allow some employers to practice discrimination, it can also provide profit-seeking firms with incentives not to discriminate. Given these incentives, Becker explored the question of why discrimination persists.\n\nIf a business is located in an area with a large minority population and refuses to sell to minorities, it will cut into its own profits. If some businesses run by bigoted employers refuse to pay women and/or minorities a wage based on their productivity, then other profit-seeking employers can hire these workers. In a **competitive market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, if the owners of a business care more about the color of money than about the color of skin, they will have an incentive to make buying, selling, hiring, and promotion decisions strictly based on economic factors.\n\nThe power of markets to offer at least a degree of freedom to oppressed groups should not be underestimated. In many countries, cohesive minority groups like Jews and emigrant Chinese have managed to carve out a space for themselves through their economic activities, despite legal and social discrimination against them. Many immigrants, including those who come to the United States, have taken advantage of economic freedom to make new lives for themselves. However, history teaches that market forces alone are unlikely to eliminate discrimination. After all, discrimination against African Americans persisted in the market-oriented U.S. economy during the century between President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the slaves in 1863, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\u2014and has continued since then, too.\n\nSo why does discrimination persist in competitive markets? Gary Becker sought to explain this persistence. Discriminatory impulses can emerge at a number of levels: among managers, among workers, and among customers. Consider the situation of a manager who is not personally prejudiced, but who has many workers or customers who are prejudiced. If that manager treats minority groups or women fairly, the manager may find it hurts the morale of prejudiced co-workers or drives away prejudiced customers. In such a situation, a policy of nondiscrimination could reduce the firm\u2019s profits. After all, a business firm is part of society, and a firm that does not follow the societal norms is likely to suffer. Market forces alone are unlikely to overwhelm strong social attitudes about discrimination.\n\n\nVisit this [website][2] to read more about wage discrimination.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Public Policies to Reduce Discrimination\n\nA first public policy step against discrimination in the labor market is to make it illegal. For example, the **Equal Pay Act of 1963**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} said that men and women who do equal work at a company must be paid the same. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The **Age Discrimination in Employment Act**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of 1967 prohibited discrimination on the basis of age against individuals who are 40 years of age or older. The **Civil Rights Act of 1991**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} provides monetary damages in cases of intentional employment discrimination. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 was aimed at prohibiting discrimination against women in the workplace who are planning to get pregnant, are pregnant, or are returning after pregnancy. Passing a law, however, is only part of the answer, since discrimination by prejudiced employers may be less important than broader social patterns.\n\nThese laws against discrimination have reduced the gender wage gap. A study by the Department of Labor in 2007 compared salaries of men and women who have similar educational achievement, work experience, and occupation and found that the gender wage gap is only 5%.\n\nIn the case of the earnings gap between blacks and whites (and also between Hispanics and whites), probably the single largest step that could be taken at this point in U.S. history to close the earnings gap would be to reduce the gap in educational achievement. Part of the answer to this issue involves finding ways to improve the performance of schools, which is a highly controversial topic in itself. In addition, the education gap is unlikely to close unless black and Hispanic families and peer groups strengthen their culture of support for educational achievement.\n\n**Affirmative action**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the name given to active efforts by government or businesses that give special rights to minorities in hiring and promotion to make up for past discrimination. Affirmative action, in its limited and not especially controversial form, means making an effort to reach out to a broader range of minority candidates for jobs. In its more aggressive and controversial form, affirmative action required government and companies to hire a specific number or percentage of minority employees. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled against state affirmative action laws. Today, affirmative action policies are applied only to federal contractors who have lost a discrimination lawsuit. This type of redress is enforced by the federal **Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\n### An Increasingly Diverse Workforce\n\nRacial and ethnic diversity is on the rise in the U.S. population and work force. As [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C15_006) shows, while the white Americans composed 78% of the population in 2012, the U.S. Bureau of the Census projects that whites will be 69% of the U.S. population by 2060. The proportion of U.S. citizens who are of Hispanic background is predicted to rise substantially. Moreover, in addition to expected changes in the population, diversity is being increased in the workforce as the women who entered the workforce in the 1970s and 1980s are now moving up the promotion ladders within their organizations.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C15_006 data-title=\"Projected Changes in America&#x2019;s Racial and Ethnic Diversity \"}\n\nFortune-telling is not economics, but it still can be clarifying to speculate about the future. Optimists argue that the growing proportions of minority workers will knock over remaining discriminatory barriers. The economy will benefit as an increasing proportion of workers from traditionally disadvantaged groups have a greater opportunity to fulfill their potential. Pessimists worry that the social tensions between men and women and between ethnic groups will rise and that workers will be less productive as a result. Anti-discrimination policy, at its best, seeks to help society move toward the more optimistic outcome.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nDiscrimination occurs in a labor market when workers with the same economic characteristics, such as education, experience, and skill, are paid different amounts because of race, gender, religion, age, or disability status. In the United States, female workers on average earn less than male workers, and black workers on average earn less than white workers. There is controversy over the extent to which these earnings gaps can be explained by discrimination or by differences in factors like education and job experience. Free markets can allow discrimination to occur; but the threat of a loss of sales or a loss of productive workers can also create incentives for a firm not to discriminate. A range of public policies can be used to reduce earnings gaps between men and women or between white and other racial/ethnic groups: requiring equal pay for equal work, and attaining more equal educational outcomes.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nExplain in each of the following situations how market forces might give a business an incentive to act in a less discriminatory fashion.\n\n1.  A local flower delivery business run by a bigoted white owner notices that many of its local customers are black.\n2.  An assembly line has traditionally only hired men, but it is having a hard time hiring sufficiently qualified workers.\n3.  A biased owner of a firm that provides home health care services would like to pay lower wages to Hispanic workers than to other employees.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  Firms have a profit incentive to sell to everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, or gender.\n2.  A business that needs to hire workers to expand may also find that if it draws only from its accustomed pool of workers\u2014say, white men\u2014it lacks the workers it needs to expand production. Such a business would have an incentive to hire more women and minorities.\n3.  A discriminatory business that is underpaying its workers may find those workers leaving for jobs with another employer who offers better pay. This market pressure could cause the discriminatory business to behave better.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the earnings gap between the average wages of females and the average wages of males prove labor market discrimination? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nNo. The earnings gap does not prove discrimination because it does not compare the wages of men and women in the same job who have the same amounts of education, experience, and productivity.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nDescribe how the earnings gap between men and women has evolved in recent decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how the earnings gap between blacks and whites has evolved in recent decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes a gap between the average earnings of men and women, or between whites and blacks, prove that employers are discriminating in the labor market? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill a free market tend to encourage or discourage discrimination? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat policies, when used together with antidiscrimination laws, might help to reduce the earnings gap between men and women or between white and black workers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how affirmative action is applied in the labor market.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nIf it is not profitable to discriminate, why does discrimination persist?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a company has discriminated against minorities in the past, should it be required to give priority to minority applicants today? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nAnderson, Deborah J., Melissa Binder, and Kate Krause. \u201cThe Motherhood Wage Penalty Revisited: Experience, Heterogeneity, Work Effort, and Work-Schedule Flexibility.\u201d *Industrial and Labor Relations Review*. no. 2 (2003): 273\u2013294. http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/econ321/orazem/anderson\\\\\\_motherhood-penalty.pdf.\n\nTurner, Margery Austin, Rob Santos, Diane K.

However, when the conversation turns to crossing national borders and are about other people arriving in the United States, laws preventing such movement often seem more reasonable. Some of the tensions over immigration stem from worries over how it might affect a country\u2019s culture, including differences in language, and patterns of family, authority, or gender relationships. Economics does not have much to say about such cultural issues. Some of the worries about immigration do, however, have to do with its effects on wages and income levels, and how it affects government taxes and spending. On those topics, economists have insights and research to offer.\n\n### Historical Patterns of Immigration\n\nSupporters and opponents of immigration look at the same data and see different patterns. Those who express concern about immigration levels to the United States point to graphics like [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C15_002) which shows total inflows of **immigrants**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} decade by decade through the twentieth century. Clearly, the level of immigration has been high and rising in recent years, reaching and exceeding the towering levels of the early twentieth century. However, those who are less worried about immigration point out that the high immigration levels of the early twentieth century happened when total population was much lower. Since the U.S. population roughly tripled during the twentieth century, the seemingly high levels in immigration in the 1990s and 2000s look relatively smaller when they are divided by the population.\n\n &#10;\"){: #CNX_Econ_C15_002 data-title=\"Immigration Since 1900 \"}\n\nWhere have the immigrants come from? Immigrants from Europe were more than 90% of the total in the first decade of the twentieth century, but less than 20% of the total by the end of the century. By the 2000s, about half of U.S. immigration came from the rest of the Americas, especially Mexico, and about a quarter came from various countries in Asia.\n\n### Economic Effects of Immigration\n\nA surge of immigration can affect the economy in a number of different ways. In this section, we will consider how immigrants might benefit the rest of the economy, how they might affect wage levels, and how they might affect government spending at the federal and local level.\n\nTo understand the economic consequences of immigration, consider the following scenario. Imagine that the immigrants entering the United States matched the existing U.S. population in age range, education, skill levels, family size, occupations, and so on. How would immigration of this type affect the rest of the U.S. economy? Immigrants themselves would be much better off, because their standard of living would be higher in the United States. Immigrants would contribute to both increased production and increased consumption. Given enough time for adjustment, the range of jobs performed, income earned, taxes paid, and public services needed would not be much affected by this kind of immigration. It would be as if the population simply increased a little.\n\nNow, consider the reality of recent immigration to the United States. Immigrants are not identical to the rest of the U.S. population. About one-third of immigrants over the age of 25 lack a high school diploma. As a result, many of the recent immigrants end up in jobs like restaurant and hotel work, lawn care, and janitorial work. This kind of immigration represents a shift to the right in the supply of unskilled labor for a number of jobs, which will lead to lower wages for these jobs. The middle- and upper-income households that purchase the services of these unskilled workers will benefit from these lower wages. However, low-skilled U.S. workers who must compete with low-skilled immigrants for jobs will tend to suffer from immigration.\n\nThe difficult policy questions about immigration are not so much about the overall gains to the rest of the economy, which seem to be real but small in the context of the U.S. economy, as they are about the disruptive effects of immigration in specific labor markets. One disruptive effect, as just noted, is that immigration weighted toward low-skill workers tends to reduce wages for domestic low-skill workers. A study by **Michael S. Clune**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} found that for each 10% rise in the number of employed immigrants with no more than a high school diploma in the labor market, high school students reduced their annual number of hours worked by 3%. The effects on wages of low-skill workers are not large\u2014perhaps in the range of decline of about 1%. These effects are likely kept low, in part, because of the legal floor of federal and state minimum wage laws. In addition, immigrants are also thought to contribute to increased demand for local goods and services which can stimulate the local low skilled labor market. It is also possible that employers, in face of abundant low-skill workers may choose production processes which are more labor intensive than otherwise would have been. These various factors would explain the small negative wage effect observed among the native low-skill workers as a result of immigration.\n\nAnother potential disruptive effect is the impact on the budgets of state and local government. Many of the costs imposed by immigrants are costs that arise in state-run programs, like the cost of public schooling and of welfare benefits. However, many of the taxes that immigrants pay are federal taxes like income taxes and Social Security taxes. Many immigrants do not own property (such as homes and cars), so they do not pay property taxes, which are one of the main sources of state and local tax revenue. Though they do pay sales taxes, which are state and local, and the landlords of property they rent pay property taxes. According to the nonprofit Rand Corporation, the effects of immigration on taxes are generally positive at the federal level, but they are negative at the state and local levels in places where there are many low-skilled immigrants.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to obtain more context regarding immigration.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Proposals for Immigration Reform\n\nThe Congressional Jordan Commission of the 1990s proposed reducing overall levels of immigration and refocusing U.S. immigration policy to give priority to immigrants with a higher level of skills. In the labor market, focusing on high-skilled immigrants would help prevent any negative effects on the wages of low-skilled workers. For government budgets, higher-skilled workers find jobs more quickly, earn higher wages, and pay more in taxes. Several other immigration-friendly countries, notably Canada and Australia, have immigration systems where those with high levels of education or job skills have a much better chance of obtaining permission to immigrate. For the United States, high tech companies regularly ask for a more lenient immigration policy to admit a greater quantity of highly skilled workers. In addition, a current immigration issue deals with the so-called \u201cDREAM Act\u201d legislation not yet passed by Congress, which would offer a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the United States before the age of 16. However, some state legislatures, such as California, have passed their own Dream Acts.\n\nIf the United States decided to reduce immigration substantially, the economic losses would likely be small relative to the overall economy. If the United States decided to increase immigration substantially, the U.S. economy certainly is large enough to afford some additional assistance to low-wage workers or to local governments that might be adversely affected by immigration. Whether immigration levels are increased, decreased, or left the same, the quality of the debate over immigration policy would be improved by an explicit recognition of who receives economic benefits from immigration and who bears its costs.\n\n\n\nCollective Bargaining in Wisconsin\n\nShould we end collective bargaining rights for government employees? In an effort to reduce the budget deficit, a contentious Wisconsin law prohibited most public employees from collectively bargaining on anything except wages. Legislators in Wisconsin argued that public safety is so important that public safety workers should be exempted from this. They could not risk firefighters and police going on strike. All firms and employees know that pensions and benefits are expensive; and there was a $3.6 billion budget deficit in Wisconsin that Governor Walker and legislators wanted to decrease. A lingering question is: should the unions have been more willing to shoulder a greater burden of the cost of those benefits? That question suggests that it is the cost, not necessarily the role of the union itself, which is the problem. After all, unions were founded to reduce the disadvantage that single employees face when bargaining with employers. Because so many government employees are union members, collective bargaining is even more important for them.\n\nUltimately, the benefit of unions is in the impact they have on economic productivity and output. The more productive the union workers become as a result of collective bargaining, the better off the economy will be.\n\nThe long-term repercussions of the Wisconsin law have yet to be realized. As a result of this bill, wage increases higher than the rate of inflation for Wisconsin public sector employees must be voted upon. Imagine if you are working for the Wisconsin government, and are able to find a higher-paying job in the private sector. What will you do? If you decide to leave because your options are better elsewhere, then the government must replace you. How will the government find workers to replace you? For some sectors of the government, reduced numbers of workers may mean greater efficiency. For other sectors, though, reduced numbers of government workers may mean reduced services.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe recent level of U.S. immigration is at a historically high level if measured in absolute numbers, but not if measured as a share of population. The overall gains to the U.S. economy from immigration are real but relatively small. However, immigration also causes effects like slightly lower wages for low-skill workers and budget problems for certain state and local governments.\n\n### Self-Check Question\n\n\n\nIf immigration is reduced, what is the impact on the wage for low-skilled labor? Explain.\n\n\n\nIf a large share of immigrants have relatively low skills, then reducing the number of immigrants would shift the supply curve of low-skill labor back to the left, which would tend to raise the equilibrium wage for low-skill labor.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nHave levels of immigration to the United States been relatively high or low in recent years? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would you expect immigration by primarily low-skill workers to affect American low-skilled workers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat factors can explain the relatively small effect of low-skilled immigration on the wages of low-skilled workers?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nIf the United States allows a greater quantity of highly skilled workers, what will be the impact on the average wages of highly skilled employees?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf all countries eliminated all barriers to immigration, would global economic growth increase? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nClune, Michael S. \u201cThe Fiscal Impacts of Immigrants: A California Case Study.\u201d In *The Immigration Debate: Studies on the Economic, Demographic, and Fiscal Effects of Immigration*, edited by James P.

This was officially known as the **Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} or as the **Affordable Care Act (ACA)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, but was more popularly known as Obamacare. The bill\u2019s opponents\u2019 claims ranged from the charge that the changes were unconstitutional and would add $750 billion to the deficit, to extreme claims about the inclusion of things like the implantation of microchips and so-called \u201cdeath panels\u201d that decide which critically-ill patients receive care and which do not.\n\nWhy did people react so strongly? After all, the intent of the law is to make healthcare insurance more affordable, to allow more people to get insurance, and to reduce the costs of healthcare. For each year from 2000 to 2011, these costs grew at least double the rate of inflation. In 2014, healthcare spending accounted for around 24% of all federal government spending. In the United States, we spend more for our healthcare than any other high-income nation. Yet in 2015, over 32 million people in the United States, about 13.2%, were without insurance. Even today, however, several years after the Act was signed into law and after it was mostly upheld by the Supreme Court, a 2015 Kaiser Foundation poll found that 43% of likely voters viewed it unfavorably. Why is this?\n\nThe debate over the ACA and healthcare reform could take an entire textbook, but what this chapter will do is introduce the basics of insurance and the problems insurance companies face. It is these problems, and how insurance companies respond to them that, in part, explain the ACA.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Information, Risk, and Insurance\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* The Problem of Imperfect Information and Asymmetric Information\n* Insurance and Imperfect Information\n\n\n\nEvery purchase is based on a belief about the satisfaction that the good or service will provide. In turn, these beliefs are based on the information that the buyer has available. For many products, the information available to the buyer or the seller is imperfect or unclear, which can either make buyers regret past purchases or avoid making future ones.\n\nThis chapter discusses how imperfect and asymmetric information affect markets. The first module of the chapter discusses how asymmetric information affects markets for goods, labor, and financial capital. When buyers have less information about the quality of the good (for example, a gemstone) than sellers do, sellers may be tempted to mislead buyers. If a buyer cannot have at least some confidence in the quality of what is being purchased, then he will be reluctant or unwilling to purchase the products. Thus, mechanisms are needed to bridge this information gap, so buyers and sellers can engage in a transaction.\n\nThe second module of the chapter discusses insurance markets, which also face similar problems of imperfect information. For example, a car insurance company would prefer to sell insurance only to those who are unlikely to have auto accidents\u2014but it is hard for the firm to identify those perfectly safe drivers. Conversely, buyers of car insurance would like to persuade the auto insurance company that they are safe drivers and should pay only a low price for insurance. If insurance markets cannot find ways to grapple with these problems of imperfect information, then even people who have low or average risks of making claims may not be able to purchase insurance. The chapter on financial markets (markets for stocks and bonds) will show that the problems of imperfect information can be especially poignant. Imperfect information cannot be eliminated, but it can often be managed.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

In May 1994, Doree Lynn bought an expensive ring from a jeweler in Washington, D.C., which included an emerald that cost $14,500. Several years later, the emerald fractured. Lynn took it to another jeweler who found that cracks in the emerald had been filled with an epoxy resin. Lynn sued the original jeweler in 1997 for selling her a treated emerald without telling her, and won. The case publicized a number of little-known facts about precious stones. Most emeralds have internal flaws, and so they are soaked in clear oil or an epoxy resin to hide the flaws and make the color more deep and clear. Clear oil can leak out over time, and epoxy resin can discolor with age or heat. However, using clear oil or epoxy to \u201cfill\u201d emeralds is completely legal, as long as it is disclosed.\n\nAfter Doree Lynn\u2019s lawsuit, the NBC news show \u201cDateline\u201d bought emeralds at four prominent jewelry stores in New York City in 1997. All the sales clerks at these stores, unaware that they were being recorded on a hidden camera, said the stones were untreated. When the emeralds were tested at a laboratory, however, it was discovered they had all been treated with oil or epoxy. Emeralds are not the only gemstones that are treated. Diamonds, topaz, and tourmaline are also often irradiated to enhance colors. The general rule is that all treatments to gemstones should be revealed, but often disclosure is not made. As such, many buyers face a situation of **asymmetric information**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where the both parties involved in an economic transaction have an unequal amount of information (one party knows much more than the other).\n\nMany economic transactions are made in a situation of **imperfect information**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where either the buyer, the seller, or both, are less than 100% certain about the qualities of what is being bought and sold. Also, the transaction may be characterized by asymmetric information, in which one party has more information than the other regarding the economic transaction. Let\u2019s begin with some examples of how imperfect information complicates transactions in goods, labor, and **financial capital markets**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. The presence of imperfect information can easily cause a decline in prices or quantities of products sold. However, buyers and sellers also have incentives to create mechanisms that will allow them to make mutually beneficial transactions even in the face of imperfect information.\n\nIf you are unclear about the difference between asymmetric information and imperfect information, read the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between imperfect and asymmetric information?\n\nFor a market to reach **equilibrium**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} sellers and buyers must have full information about the product\u2019s price and quality. If there is limited information, then buyers and sellers may not be able to transact or will possibly make poor decisions.\n\nImperfect information refers to the situation where buyers and/or sellers do not have all of the necessary information to make an informed decision about the price or quality of a product. The term imperfect information simply means that not all the information necessary to make an informed decision is known to the buyers and/or sellers. Asymmetric information is the condition where one party, either the buyer or the seller, has more information about the quality or price of the product than the other party. In either case (imperfect or asymmetric information) buyers or sellers need remedies to make more informed decisions.\n\n\n\n### \u201cLemons\u201d and Other Examples of Imperfect Information\n\nConsider Marvin, who is trying to decide whether to buy a used car. Let\u2019s assume that Marvin is truly clueless about what happens inside a car\u2019s engine. He is willing to do some background research, like reading *Consumer Reports* or checking websites that offer information about makes and models of used cars and what they should cost. He might pay a mechanic to inspect the car. Even after devoting some money and time collecting information, however, Marvin still cannot be absolutely sure that he is buying a high-quality used car. He knows that he might buy the car, drive it home, and use it for a few weeks before discovering that car is a \u201clemon,\u201d which is slang for a defective product (especially a car).\n\nImagine that Marvin shops for a used car and finds two that look very similar in terms of mileage, exterior appearances, and age. One car costs $4,000, while the other car costs $4,600. Which car should Marvin buy?\n\nIf Marvin was choosing in a world of perfect information, the answer would be simple: he should buy the cheaper car. But Marvin is operating in a world of imperfect information, where the sellers likely know more about the car\u2019s problems than he does, and have an incentive to hide the information. After all, the more problems that are disclosed, the lower the car\u2019s selling price.\n\nWhat should Marvin do? First, he needs to understand that even with imperfect information, prices still reflect information. Typically, used cars are more expensive on some dealer lots because the dealers have a trustworthy reputation to uphold. Those dealers try to fix problems that may not be obvious to their customers, in order to create good word of mouth about their vehicles\u2019 long term reliability. The short term benefits of selling their customers a \u201clemon\u201d could cause a quick collapse in the dealer\u2019s reputation and a loss of long term profits. On other lots that are less well-established, one can find cheaper used cars, but the buyer takes on more risk when a dealer\u2019s reputation has little at stake. The cheapest cars of all often appear on Craigslist, where the individual seller has no reputation to defend. In sum, cheaper prices do carry more risk, so Marvin should balance his appetite for risk versus the potential headaches of many more unanticipated trips to the repair shop.\n\nSimilar problems with imperfect information arise in labor and financial capital markets. Consider Greta, who is applying for a job. Her potential employer, like the used car buyer, is concerned about ending up with a \u201clemon\u201d\u2014in this case a poor quality employee. The employer will collect information about Greta\u2019s academic and work history. In the end, however, a degree of uncertainty will inevitably remain regarding Greta\u2019s abilities, which are hard to demonstrate without actually observing her on the job. How can a potential employer screen for certain attributes, such as motivation, timeliness, ability to get along with others, and so on? Employers often look to trade schools and colleges to pre-screen candidates. Employers may not even interview a candidate unless he has a degree and, sometimes, a degree from a particular school. Employers may also view awards, a high grade point average, and other accolades as a signal of hard work, perseverance, and ability. Employers may also seek references for insights into key attributes such as energy level, work ethic, and so on.\n\n### How Imperfect Information Can Affect Equilibrium Price and Quantity\n\nThe presence of imperfect information can discourage both buyers and sellers from participating in the market. Buyers may become reluctant to participate because they cannot determine the quality of a product. Sellers of high-quality or medium-quality goods may be reluctant to participate, because it is difficult to demonstrate the quality of their goods to buyers\u2014and since buyers cannot determine which goods have higher quality, they are likely to be unwilling to pay a higher price for such goods.\n\nA market with few buyers and few sellers is sometimes referred to as a **thin market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. By contrast, a market with many buyers and sellers is called a **thick market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. When imperfect information is severe and buyers and sellers are discouraged from participating, markets may become extremely thin as a relatively small number of buyer and sellers attempt to communicate enough information that they can agree on a price.\n\n### When Price Mixes with Imperfect Information about Quality\n\nA buyer confronted with imperfect information will often believe that the price being charged reveals something about the quality of the product. For example, a buyer may assume that a gemstone or a used car that costs more must be of higher quality, even though the buyer is not an expert on gemstones. Think of the expensive restaurant where the food must be good because it is so expensive or the shop where the clothes must be stylish because they cost so much, or the gallery where the art must be great, because it costs so much. If you are hiring a lawyer, you might assume that a lawyer who charges $400 per hour must be better than a lawyer who charges $150 per hour. In these cases, price can act as a signal of quality.\n\nWhen buyers use the market price to draw inferences about the quality of products, then markets may have trouble reaching an **equilibrium price**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and quantity. Imagine a situation where a used car dealer has a lot full of used cars that do not seem to be selling, and so the dealer decides to cut the prices of the cars to sell a greater quantity. In a market with imperfect information, many buyers may assume that the lower price implies low-quality cars. As a result, the lower price may not attract more customers. Conversely, a dealer who raises prices may find that customers assume that the higher price means that cars are of higher quality; as a result of raising prices, the dealer might sell more cars. (Whether or not consumers always behave rationally, as an economist would see it, is the subject of the following Clear It Up feature.)\n\nThe idea that higher prices might cause a greater quantity demanded and that lower prices might cause a lower quantity demanded runs exactly counter to the basic model of demand and supply (as outlined in the [Demand and Supply](/m48628){: .target-chapter} chapter). These contrary effects, however, will reach natural limits. At some point, if the price is high enough, the quantity demanded will decline. Conversely, when the price declines far enough, buyers will increasingly find value even if the quality is lower. In addition, information eventually becomes more widely known. An overpriced restaurant that charges more than the quality of its food is worth to many buyers will not last forever.\n\n\n\nIs consumer behavior rational?\n\nThere is a lot of human behavior out there that mainstream economists have tended to call \u201cirrational\u201d since it is consistently at odds with economists\u2019 **utility maximizing**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} models. The typical response is for economists to brush these behaviors aside and call them \u201canomalies\u201d or unexplained quirks.\n\n\u201cIf only you knew more economics, you would not be so irrational,\u201d is what many mainstream economists seem to be saying. A group known as **behavioral economists**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} has challenged this notion, because so much of this so-called \u201cquirky\u201d behavior is extremely common among us. For example, a conventional economist would say that if you lost a $10 bill today, and also got an extra $10 in your paycheck, you should feel perfectly neutral. After all, \u2013$10 + $10 = $0. You are the same financially as you were before. However, behavioral economists have done research that shows many people will feel some negative emotion\u2014anger, frustration, and so forth\u2014after those two things happen. We tend to focus more on the loss than the gain. This is known as \u201closs aversion,\u201d where a $1 loss pains us 2.25 times more than a $1 gain helps us, according to the economists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in a famous 1979 *Econometrica* paper. This has implications for investing, as people tend to \u201coverplay\u201d the stock market by reacting more to losses than to gains.\n\nBehavioral economics also tries to explain why people make seemingly irrational decisions in the presence of different situations, or how the decision is \u201cframed.\u201d A popular example is outlined here: Imagine you have the opportunity to buy an alarm clock for $20 in Store A. Across the street, you learn, is the exact same clock at Store B for $10. You might say it is worth your time\u2014a five minute walk\u2014to save $10. Now, take a different example: You are in Store A buying a $300 phone. Five minutes away, at Store B, the same phone is $290. You again save $10 by taking a five minute walk. Do you do it?\n\nSurprisingly, it is likely that you would not. Mainstream economists would say \u201c$10 is $10\u201d and that it would be irrational to make a five minute walk for $10 in one case and not the other. However, behavioral economists have pointed out that most of us evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point\u2014here the cost of the product\u2014and think of gains and losses as percentages rather than using actual savings.\n\nWhich view is right? Both have their advantages, but behavioral economists have at least shed a light on trying to describe and explain systematic behavior which previously has been dismissed as irrational. If most of us are engaged in some \u201cirrational behavior,\u201d perhaps there are deeper underlying reasons for this behavior in the first place.\n\n\n\n### Mechanisms to Reduce the Risk of Imperfect Information\n\nIf you were selling a good like emeralds or used cars where imperfect information is likely to be a problem, how could you reassure possible buyers? If you were buying a good where imperfect information is a problem, what would it take to reassure you? Buyers and sellers in the goods market rely on reputation as well as guarantees, warrantees, and service contracts to assure product quality; in the labor market, occupational licenses and certifications are used to assure competency, while in financial capital market cosigners and collateral are used as insurance against unforeseen, detrimental events.\n\nIn the goods market, the seller of a good might offer a **money-back guarantee**{: data-type=\"term\"}, an agreement that functions as a promise of quality. This strategy may be especially important for a company that sells goods through mail-order catalogs or over the web, whose customers cannot see the actual products, because it encourages people to buy something even if they are not certain they want to keep it.\n\nL.L. Bean started using money-back-guarantees in 1911, when the founder stitched waterproof shoe rubbers together with leather shoe tops, and sold them as hunting shoes. He guaranteed satisfaction. However, the stitching came apart and, out of the first batch of 100 pairs that were sold, 90 pairs were returned. L.L. Bean took out a bank loan, repaired all of the shoes, and replaced them. The L.L. Bean reputation for customer satisfaction began to spread. Many firms today offer money-back-guarantees for a few weeks or months, but L.L. Bean offers a complete money-back guarantee. Anything you have bought from L.L. Bean can always be returned, no matter how many years later or what condition the product is in, for a full money-back guarantee.\n\nL.L. Bean has very few stores. Instead, most of its sales are made by mail, telephone, or, now, through their website. For this kind of firm, imperfect information may be an especially difficult problem, because customers cannot see and touch what they are buying. A combination of a money-back guarantee and a reputation for quality can help for a mail-order firm to flourish.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read about the origin of Eddie Bauer\u2019s 100% customer satisfaction guarantee.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nSellers may offer a **warranty**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is a promise to fix or replace the good, at least for a certain period of time. The seller may also offer a buyer a chance to buy a **service contract**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where the buyer pays an extra amount and the seller agrees to fix anything that goes wrong for a set time period. Service contracts are often used with large purchases such as cars, appliances and even houses.\n\nGuarantees, warranties, and service contracts are examples of explicit reassurance that sellers provide. In many cases, firms also offer unstated guarantees. For example, some movie theaters might refund the cost of a ticket to a customer who walks out complaining about the show. Likewise, while restaurants do not generally advertise a money-back guarantee or exchange policies, many restaurants allow customers to exchange one dish for another or reduce the price of the bill if the customer is not satisfied.\n\nThe rationale for these policies is that firms want repeat customers, who in turn will recommend the business to others; as such, establishing a good reputation is of paramount importance. When buyers know that a firm is concerned about its reputation, they are less likely to worry about receiving a poor-quality product. For example, a well-established grocery store with a good reputation can often charge a higher price than a temporary stand at a local farmer\u2019s market, where the buyer may never see the seller again.\n\nSellers of labor provide information through resumes, recommendations, school transcripts, and examples of their work. **Occupational licenses**{: data-type=\"term\"} are also used to establish quality in the **labor market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Occupational licenses, which are typically issued by government agencies, show that a worker has completed a certain type of education or passed a certain test. Some of the professionals who must hold a license are doctors, teachers, nurses, engineers, accountants, and lawyers. In addition, most states require a license to work as a barber, an embalmer, a dietitian, a massage therapist, a hearing aid dealer, a counselor, an insurance agent, and a real estate broker. Some other jobs require a license in only one state. Minnesota requires a state license to be a field archeologist. North Dakota has a state license for bait retailers. In Louisiana, a state license is needed to be a \u201cstress analyst\u201d and California requires a state license to be a furniture upholsterer. According to a 2013 study from the University of Chicago, about 29% of U.S. workers have jobs that require occupational licenses.\n\nOccupational licenses have their downside as well, as they represent a barrier to entry to certain industries. This makes it more difficult for new entrants to compete with incumbents, which can lead to higher prices and less consumer choice. In industries that require licenses, the government has decided that the additional information provided by licenses outweighs the negative effect on competition.\n\n\n\nAre advertisers allowed to benefit from imperfect information?\n\nMany advertisements seem full of imperfect information\u2014at least by what they imply. Driving a certain car, drinking a particular soda, or wearing a certain shoe are all unlikely to bring fashionable friends and fun automatically, if at all. The government rules on advertising, enforced by the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, allow advertising to contain a certain amount of exaggeration about the general delight of using a product. They, however, also demand that if a claim is presented as a fact, it must be true.\n\nLegally, deceptive advertising dates back to the 1950s when Colgate-Palmolive created a television advertisement that seemed to show Rapid Shave shaving cream being spread on sandpaper and then the sand was shaved off the sandpaper. What the television advertisement actually showed was sand sprinkled on Plexiglas\u2014without glue\u2014and then scraped aside by the razor.\n\nIn the 1960s, in magazine advertisements for Campbell\u2019s vegetable soup, the company was having problems getting an appetizing picture of the soup, because the vegetables kept sinking. So they filled a bowl with marbles and poured the soup over the top, so that the bowl appeared to be crammed with vegetables.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the Volvo Company filmed a television advertisement that showed a monster truck driving over cars, crunching their roofs\u2014all except for the Volvo, which did not crush. However, the FTC found in 1991 that the roof of the Volvo used in the filming had been reinforced with an extra steel framework, while the roof supports on the other car brands had been cut.\n\nThe Wonder Bread Company ran television advertisements featuring \u201cProfessor Wonder,\u201d who said that because Wonder Bread contained extra calcium, it would help children\u2019s minds work better and improve their memory. The FTC objected, and in 2002 the company agreed to stop running the advertisements.\n\nAs can be seen in each of these cases, factual claims about the product\u2019s performance are often checked, at least to some extent, by the Federal Trade Commission. Language and images that are exaggerated or ambiguous, but not actually false, are allowed in advertising. Untrue \u201cfacts\u201d are not allowed. In any case, an old Latin saying applies when watching advertisements: *Caveat emptor*\u2014that is, \u201clet the buyer beware.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the buyer\u2019s side of the labor market, a standard precaution against hiring a \u201clemon\u201d of an employee is to specify that the first few months of employment are officially a trial or probationary period, and that the worker can be let go for any reason or no reason after that time. Sometimes workers also receive lower pay during this trial period.\n\nIn the **financial capital market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, before a bank makes a loan, it requires a prospective borrower fill out forms regarding the sources of income; in addition, the bank conducts a credit check on the individual\u2019s past borrowing. Another approach is to require a **cosigner**{: data-type=\"term\"} on a loan; that is, another person or firm who legally pledges to repay some or all of the money if the original borrower does not do so. Yet another approach is to require **collateral**{: data-type=\"term\"}, often property or equipment that the bank would have a right to seize and sell if the loan is not repaid.\n\nBuyers of goods and services cannot possibly become experts in evaluating the quality of gemstones, used cars, lawyers, and everything else they buy. Employers and lenders cannot be perfectly omniscient about whether possible workers will turn out well or potential borrowers will repay loans on time. But the mechanisms mentioned above can reduce the risks associated with imperfect information so that the buyer and seller are willing to proceed.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nMany economic transactions are made in a situation of imperfect information, where either the buyer, the seller, or both are less than 100% certain about the qualities of what is being bought and sold. When information about the quality of products is highly imperfect, it may be difficult for a market to exist.\n\nA \u201clemon\u201d is the name given to a product that turns out, after the purchase, to have low quality. When the seller has more accurate information about the quality of the product than the buyer, the buyer will be hesitant to buy, out of fear of purchasing a \u201clemon.\u201d\n\nMarkets have many ways to deal with imperfect information. In goods markets, buyers facing imperfect information about products may depend upon money-back guarantees, warranties, service contracts, and reputation. In labor markets, employers facing imperfect information about potential employees may turn to resumes, recommendations, occupational licenses for certain jobs, and employment for trial periods. In capital markets, lenders facing imperfect information about borrowers may require detailed loan applications and credit checks, cosigners, and collateral.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nFor each of the following purchases, say whether you would expect the degree of imperfect information to be relatively high or relatively low:\n\n1.  Buying apples at a roadside stand\n2.  Buying dinner at the neighborhood restaurant around the corner\n3.  Buying a used laptop computer at a garage sale\n4.  Ordering flowers over the Internet for your friend in a different city\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  Imperfect information is relatively low; after all, you can see the apples.\n2.  Imperfect information is relatively low. The neighborhood restaurant probably has a certain local reputation.\n3.  Imperfect information is relatively high. How can you tell whether the computer is really in good working order? Why are they selling it?\n4.  Imperfect information is relatively high. What do those flowers really look like?\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is there asymmetric information in the labor market? What signals can an employer look for that might indicate the traits they are seeking in a new employee?\n\n\n\nAsymmetric information often exists in the labor market because employers cannot observe many key employee attributes until after the person is hired. Employees, however, know whether they are energetic or detailed-oriented. Employers, therefore, often seek schools to pre-screen candidates. Employers may not even interview a candidate unless he has a degree and often a degree from a particular school. Employers may also view awards, a high grade point average, and other accolades as a signal of hard work, perseverance, and ability. Finally, employers seek references for insights into key attributes such as energy level, work ethic, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhy might it be difficult for a buyer and seller to agree on a price when imperfect information exists?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do economists (and used-car dealers) mean by a \u201clemon\u201d?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the ways a seller of goods might reassure a possible buyer who is faced with imperfect information?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the ways a seller of labor (that is, someone looking for a job) might reassure a possible employer who is faced with imperfect information?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the ways that someone looking for a loan might reassure a bank that is faced with imperfect information about whether the loan will be repaid?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nYou are on the board of directors of a private high school, which is hiring new tenth-grade science teachers. As you think about hiring someone for a job, what are some mechanisms you might use to overcome the problem of imperfect information?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA website offers a place for people to buy and sell emeralds, but information about emeralds can be quite imperfect. The website then enacts a rule that all sellers in the market must pay for two independent examinations of their emerald, which are available to the customer for inspection.\n\n1.  How would you expect this improved information to affect demand for emeralds on this website?\n2.  How would you expect this improved information to affect the quantity of high-quality emeralds sold on the website?\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Problem\n\n\n\nUsing [[link]](#fs-idp5273632), sketch the effects in parts (a) and (b) on a single supply and demand diagram.

The insurance company prices these premiums based on the probability of certain events occurring among a pool of people. Members of the group who then suffer a specified bad experience receive payments from this pool of money.\n\nMany people have several kinds of insurance: health insurance that pays when they receive medical care; car insurance that pays if they are the driver in an automobile accident; house or renter\u2019s insurance that pays if possessions are stolen or damaged by fire; and life insurance, which pays for the family if the principal dies.

At an obvious level, future events cannot be predicted with certainty. For example, it cannot be known with certainty who will have a car accident, become ill, die, or have his home robbed in the next year. Imperfect information also applies to estimating the risk that something will happen to any individual. It is difficult for an insurance company to estimate the risk that, say, a particular 20-year-old male driver from New York City will have an accident, because even within that group, some drivers will drive more safely than others. Thus, adverse events occur out of a combination of people\u2019s characteristics and choices that make the risks higher or lower and then the good or bad luck of what actually happens.\n\n### How Insurance Works\n\nA simplified example of automobile insurance might work this way. Suppose that a group of 100 drivers can be divided into three groups. In a given year, 60 of those people have only a few door dings or chipped paint, which costs $100 each. Another 30 of the drivers have medium-sized accidents that cost an average of $1,000 in damages, and 10 of the drivers have large accidents that cost $15,000 in damages. For the moment, let\u2019s imagine that at the beginning of any year, there is no way of identifying the drivers who are low-risk, medium-risk, or high-risk. The total damage incurred by car accidents in this group of 100 drivers will be $186,000, that is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Total\u00a0damage</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>(60\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0$100)\u00a0+\u00a0(30\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0$1,000)\u00a0+\u00a0(10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0$15,000)</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>$600\u00a0+\u00a0$30,000\u00a0+\u00a0$150,000</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>$186,000</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nIf each of the 100 drivers pays a premium of $1,860 each year, the insurance company will collect the $186,000 that is needed to cover the costs of the accidents that occur.\n\nSince insurance companies have such a large number of clients, they are able to negotiate with providers of health care and other services for lower rates than the individual would be able to get, thus increasing the benefit to consumers of becoming insured and saving the insurance company itself money when it pays out claims.\n\nInsurance companies receive income, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C16_001), from insurance premiums and investment income. Investment income is derived from investing the funds that insurance companies received in the past but did not pay out as insurance claims in prior years. The insurance company receives a rate of return from investing these funds or reserves. The investments are typically made in fairly safe, liquid (easy to convert into cash) investments, as the insurance companies needs to be able to readily access these funds when a major disaster strikes.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C16_001 data-title=\"An Insurance Company: What Comes In, What Goes Out \"}\n\n### Government and Social Insurance\n\nFederal and state governments run a number of insurance programs. Some of the programs look much like **private insurance**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, in the sense that the members of a group makes steady payments into a fund, and those in the group who suffer an adverse experience receive payments. Other programs protect against risk, but without an explicit fund being set up. Following are some examples.\n\n* **Unemployment insurance**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\\: Employers in every state pay a small amount for unemployment insurance, which goes into a fund that is used to pay benefits to workers for a period of time, usually six months, after they lose their jobs.\n* **Pension insurance**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\\: Employers that offer pensions to their retired employees are required by law to pay a small fraction of what they are setting aside for pensions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, which is used to pay at least some pension benefits to workers if a company goes bankrupt and cannot pay the pensions it has promised.\n* **Deposit insurance**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\\: Banks are required by law to pay a small fraction of their deposits to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which goes into a fund that is used to pay depositors the value of their bank deposits up to $250,000 (the amount was raised from $100,000 to $250,000 in 2008) if the bank should go bankrupt.\n* **Workman\u2019s compensation insurance**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\\: Employers are required by law to pay a small percentage of the salaries that they pay into funds, typically run at the state level, that are used to pay benefits to workers who suffer an injury on the job.\n* **Retirement insurance**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\\: All workers pay a percentage of their income into Social Security and into Medicare, which then provides income and health care benefits to the elderly. Social Security and Medicare are not literally \u201cinsurance\u201d in the sense that those currently contributing to the fund are not eligible for benefits. They function like insurance, however, in the sense that regular payments are made into the programs today in exchange for benefits to be received in the case of a later event\u2014either becoming old or becoming sick when old. Such programs are sometimes called \u201csocial insurance.\u201d\n\nThe major additional costs to insurance companies, other than the payment of claims, are the costs of running a business: the administrative costs of hiring workers, administering accounts, and processing insurance claims. For most insurance companies, the insurance premiums coming in and the claims payments going out are much larger than the amounts earned by investing money or the administrative costs.\n\nThus, while factors like investment income earned on reserves, administrative costs, and groups with different risks complicate the overall picture, a fundamental law of insurance must hold true: The average person\u2019s payments into insurance over time must cover 1) the average person\u2019s claims, 2) the costs of running the company, and 3) leave room for the firm\u2019s profits. This law can be boiled down to the idea that average premiums and average insurance payouts must be approximately equal.\n\n### Risk Groups and Actuarial Fairness\n\nNot all of those who purchase insurance face the same risks. Some people may be more likely, because of genetics or personal habits, to fall sick with certain diseases. Some people may live in an area where car theft or home robbery is more likely than others. Some drivers are safer than others. A **risk group**{: data-type=\"term\"} can be defined as a group that shares roughly the same risks of an adverse event occurring.\n\nInsurance companies often classify people into risk groups, and charge lower premiums to those with lower risks. If people are not separated into risk groups, then those with low-risk must pay for those with high risks. In the simple example of how car insurance works, given earlier, 60 drivers had very low damage of $100 each, 30 drivers had medium-sized accidents that cost $1,000 each, and 10 of the drivers had large accidents that cost $15,000. If all 100 of these drivers pay the same $1,860, then those with low damages are in effect paying for those with high damages.\n\nIf it is possible to classify drivers according to risk group, then each group can be charged according to its expected losses. For example, the insurance company might charge the 60 drivers who seem safest of all $100 apiece, which is the average value of the damages they cause. Then the intermediate group could pay $1,000 apiece and the high-cost group $15,000 each. When the level of insurance premiums that someone pays is equal to the amount that an average person in that risk group would collect in insurance payments, the level of insurance is said to be \u201cactuarially fair.\u201d\n\nClassifying people into risk groups can be controversial. For example, if someone had a major automobile accident last year, should that person be classified as a high-risk driver who is likely to have similar accidents in the future, or as a low-risk driver who was just extremely unlucky? The driver is likely to claim to be low-risk, and thus someone who should be in a risk group with those who pay low insurance premiums in the future. The insurance company is likely to believe that, on average, having a major accident is a signal of being a high-risk driver, and thus try to charge this driver higher insurance premiums. The next two sections discuss the two major problems of imperfect information in insurance markets\u2014called moral hazard and adverse selection. Both problems arise from attempts to categorize those purchasing insurance into risk groups.\n\n### The Moral Hazard Problem\n\n**Moral hazard**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to the case when people engage in riskier behavior with insurance than they would if they did not have insurance. For example, if you have health insurance that covers the cost of visiting the doctor, you may be less likely to take precautions against catching an illness that might require a doctor\u2019s visit. If you have car insurance, you will worry less about driving or parking your car in ways that make it more likely to get dented. In another example, a business without insurance might install absolute top-level security and fire sprinkler systems to guard against theft and fire. If it is insured, that same business might only install a minimum level of security and fire sprinkler systems.\n\nMoral hazard cannot be eliminated, but insurance companies have some ways of reducing its effect. Investigations to prevent insurance fraud are one way of reducing the extreme cases of moral hazard. Insurance companies can also monitor certain kinds of behavior; to return to the example from above, they might offer a business a lower rate on property insurance if the business installs a top-level security and fire sprinkler system and has those systems inspected once a year.\n\nAnother method to reduce moral hazard is to require the injured party to pay a share of the costs. For example, insurance policies often have **deductibles**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is an amount that the insurance policyholder must pay out of their own pocket before the insurance coverage starts paying. For example, auto insurance might pay for all losses greater than $500. Health insurance policies often have a **copayment**{: data-type=\"term\"}, in which the policyholder must pay a small amount; for example, a person might have to pay $20 for each doctor visit, and the insurance company would cover the rest. Another method of cost-sharing is **coinsurance**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which means that the insurance company covers a certain percentage of the cost. For example, insurance might pay for 80% of the costs of repairing a home after a fire, but the homeowner would pay the other 20%.\n\nAll of these forms of cost-sharing discourage moral hazard, because people know that they will have to pay something out of their own pocket when they make an insurance claim. The effect can be powerful. One prominent study found that when people face moderate deductibles and copayments for their health insurance, they consume about one-third less in medical care than people who have complete insurance and do not pay anything out of pocket, presumably because deductibles and copayments reduce the level of moral hazard. However, those who consumed less health care did not seem to have any difference in health status.\n\nA final way of reducing moral hazard, which is especially applicable to health care, is to focus on the incentives of providers of health care, rather than consumers. Traditionally, most health care in the United States has been provided on a **fee-for-service**{: data-type=\"term\"} basis, which means that medical care providers are paid for the services they provide and are paid more if they provide additional services. However, in the last decade or so, the structure of healthcare provision has shifted to an emphasis on health maintenance organizations (HMOs). A **health maintenance organization (HMO)**{: data-type=\"term\"} provides healthcare that receives a fixed amount per person enrolled in the plan\u2014regardless of how many services are provided. In this case, a patient with insurance has an incentive to demand more care, but the healthcare provider, which is receiving only a fixed payment, has an incentive to reduce the moral hazard problem by limiting the quantity of care provided\u2014as long as it will not lead to worse health problems and higher costs later. Today, many doctors are paid with some combination of managed care and fee-for-service; that is, a flat amount per patient, but with additional payments for the treatment of certain health conditions.\n\nImperfect information is the cause of the moral hazard problem. If an insurance company had perfect information on risk, it could simply raise its premiums every time an insured party engages in riskier behavior. However, an insurance company cannot monitor all the risks that people take all the time and so, even with various checks and cost-sharing, moral hazard will remain a problem.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read about the relationship between health care and behavioral economics.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### The Adverse Selection Problem\n\n**Adverse selection**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to the problem in which the buyers of insurance have more information about whether they are high-risk or low-risk than the insurance company does. This creates an asymmetric information problem for the insurance company because buyers who are high-risk tend to want to buy more insurance, without letting the insurance company know about their higher risk. For example, someone purchasing health insurance or life insurance probably knows more about their family\u2019s health history than an insurer can reasonably find out even with a costly investigation; someone purchasing car insurance may know that they are a high-risk driver who has not yet had a major accident\u2014but it is hard for the insurance company to collect information about how people actually drive.\n\nTo understand how adverse selection can strangle an insurance market, recall the situation of 100 drivers who are buying automobile insurance, where 60 drivers had very low damages of $100 each, 30 drivers had medium-sized accidents that cost $1,000 each, and 10 of the drivers had large accidents that cost $15,000. That would equal $186,000 in total payouts by the insurance company. Imagine that, while the insurance company knows the overall size of the losses, it cannot identify the high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk drivers. However, the drivers themselves know their risk groups. Since there is asymmetric information between the insurance company and the drivers, the insurance company would likely set the price of insurance at $1,860 per year, to cover the average loss (not including the cost of overhead and profit). The result is that those with low risks of only $100 will likely decide not to buy insurance; after all, it makes no sense for them to pay $1,860 per year when they are likely only to experience losses of $100. Those with medium risks of a $1,000 accident will not buy insurance either. So the insurance company ends up only selling insurance for $1,860 to high-risk drivers who will average $15,000 in claims apiece. So the insurance company ends up losing a lot of money. If the insurance company tries to raise its premiums to cover the losses of those with high risks, then those with low or medium risks will be even more discouraged from buying insurance.\n\nRather than face such a situation of adverse selection, the insurance company may decide not to sell insurance in this **market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} at all. If an insurance market is to exist, then one of two things must happen. First, the insurance company might find some way of separating insurance buyers into risk groups with some degree of accuracy and charging them accordingly, which in practice often means that the insurance company tries not to sell insurance to those who may pose high risks. Or second, those with low risks must be required to buy insurance, even if they have to pay more than the actuarially fair amount for their risk group. The notion that people can be required to purchase insurance raises the issue of government laws and regulations that influence the insurance industry.\n\n### U.S. Health Care in an International Context\n\nThe United States is the only high-income country in the world where most health insurance is paid for and provided by private firms. Greater government involvement in the provision of health insurance is one possible way of addressing moral hazard and adverse selection problems.\n\nThe moral hazard problem with health insurance is that when people have insurance, they will demand higher quantities of health care. In the United States, private healthcare insurance tends to encourage an ever-greater demand for healthcare services, which healthcare providers are happy to fulfill. [\\[link\\]](#Table_16_02) shows that on a per-person basis, U.S. healthcare spending towers above other countries. It should be noted that while healthcare expenditures in the United States are far higher than healthcare expenditures in other countries, the health outcomes in the United States, as measured by life expectancy and lower rates of childhood mortality, tend to be lower. Health outcomes, however, may not be significantly affected by healthcare expenditures. Many studies have shown that a country\u2019s health is more closely related to diet, exercise, and genetic factors than to healthcare expenditure. This fact further emphasizes that the United States is spending very large amounts on medical care with little obvious health gain.\n\nIn the U.S. health insurance market, the main way of solving this adverse selection problem is that health insurance is often sold through groups based on place of employment, or, under The Affordable Care Act, from a state government sponsored health exchange market. From an insurance company\u2019s point of view, selling insurance through an employer mixes together a group of people\u2014some with high risks of future health problems and some with lower risks\u2014and thus reduces the insurance firm\u2019s fear of attracting only those who have high risks. However, many small companies do not provide health insurance to their employees, and many lower-paying jobs do not include health insurance. Even after all U.S. government programs that provide health insurance for the elderly and the poor are taken into account, approximately 32 million Americans were without health insurance in 2015. While a government-controlled system can avoid the adverse selection problem entirely by providing at least basic health insurance for all, another option is to mandate that all Americans buy health insurance from some provider by preventing providers from denying individuals based on preexisting conditions. Indeed, this approach was adopted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which is discussed later on in this chapter.\n\n<table id=\"Table_16_02\" summary=\"The table has 6 columns.

But the system also struggles to control its high costs and to provide basic medical care to all. Other countries have lower costs and more equal access, but they often struggle to provide rapid access to health care and to offer the near-miracles of the most up-to-date medical care. The challenge is a healthcare system that strikes the right balance between quality, access, and cost.\n\n### Government Regulation of Insurance\n\nThe U.S. insurance industry is primarily regulated at the state level; indeed, since 1871 there has been a **National Association of Insurance Commissioners**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} that brings together these state regulators to exchange information and strategies. The state insurance regulators typically attempt to accomplish two things: to keep the price of insurance low and to make sure that everyone has insurance. These goals, however, can conflict with each other and also become easily entangled in politics.\n\nIf insurance premiums are set at actuarially fair levels, so that people end up paying an amount that accurately reflects their risk group, certain people will end up paying a lot. For example, if health insurance companies were trying to cover people who already have a chronic disease like AIDS, or who were elderly, they would charge these groups very high premiums for health insurance, because their expected health care costs are quite high. Women in the age bracket 18\u201344 consume, on average, about 65% more in health care spending than men. Young male drivers have more car accidents than young female drivers. Thus, actuarially fair insurance would tend to charge young men much more for car insurance than young women. Because people in high-risk groups would find themselves charged so heavily for insurance, they might choose not to buy insurance at all.\n\nState insurance regulators have sometimes reacted by passing rules that attempt to set low premiums for insurance. Over time, however, the fundamental law of insurance must hold: the average amount received by individuals must equal the average amount paid in premiums. When rules are passed to keep premiums low, insurance companies try to avoid insuring any high-risk or even medium-risk parties. If a state legislature passes strict rules requiring insurance companies to sell to everyone at low prices, the insurance companies always have the option of withdrawing from doing business in that state. For example, the insurance regulators in New Jersey are well-known for attempting to keep auto insurance premiums low, and more than 20 different insurance companies stopped doing business in the state in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Similarly, in 2009, State Farm announced that it was withdrawing from selling property insurance in Florida.\n\nIn short, government regulators cannot force companies to charge low prices and provide high levels of insurance coverage\u2014and thus take losses\u2014for a sustained period of time. If insurance premiums are going to be set below the actuarially fair level for a certain group, some other group will have to make up the difference. There are two other groups who can make up the difference: taxpayers or other buyers of insurance.\n\nIn some industries, the U.S. government has decided free markets will not provide insurance at an affordable price, and so the government pays for it directly. For example, private health insurance is too expensive for many people whose incomes are too low. To combat this, the U.S. government, together with the states, runs the Medicaid program, which provides health care to those with low incomes. Private health insurance also does not work well for the elderly, because their average health care costs can be very high. Thus, the U.S. government started the Medicare program, which provides health insurance to all those over age 65. Other government-funded health-care programs are aimed at military veterans, as an added benefit, and children in families with relatively low incomes.\n\nAnother common government intervention in insurance markets is to require that everyone buy certain kinds of insurance. For example, most states legally require car owners to buy auto insurance. Likewise, when a bank loans someone money to buy a home, the person is typically required to have homeowner\u2019s insurance, which protects against fire and other physical damage (like hailstorms) to the home. A legal requirement that everyone must buy insurance means that insurance companies do not need to worry that those with low risks will avoid buying insurance. Since insurance companies do not need to fear adverse selection, they can set their prices based on an average for the market, and those with lower risks will, to some extent, end up subsidizing those with higher risks. However, even when laws are passed requiring people to purchase insurance, insurance companies cannot be compelled to sell insurance to everyone who asks\u2014at least not at low cost. Thus, insurance companies will still try to avoid selling insurance to those with high risks whenever possible.\n\nThe government cannot pass laws that make the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection disappear, but the government can make political decisions that certain groups should have insurance, even though the private market would not otherwise provide that insurance. Also, the government can impose the costs of that decision on taxpayers or on other buyers of insurance.\n\n### The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act\n\nIn March of 2010, President Obama signed into law the **Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. This highly contentious law began to be phased in over time starting in October of 2013. The goal of the act is to bring the United States closer to universal coverage. Some of the key features of the plan include:\n\n* Individual mandate: All individuals, who do not receive health care through their employer or through a government program (for example, Medicare), are required to have health insurance or pay a fine. The individual mandate\\'s goal was to reduce the adverse selection problem and keep prices down by requiring all consumers\u2014even the healthiest ones\u2014to have health insurance. Without the need to guard against adverse selection (whereby only the riskiest consumers buy insurance) by raising prices, health insurance companies could provide more reasonable plans to their customers.\n* Each state is required to have health insurance exchanges whereby insurance companies compete for business. The goal of the exchanges is to improve competition in the market for health insurance.\n* Employer mandate: All employers with more than 50 employees must offer health insurance to their employees.\n\nThe **Affordable Care Act (ACA)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} will be funded through additional taxes to include:\n\n* Increase the Medicare tax by 0.9 percent and add a 3.8 percent tax on unearned income for high income taxpayers.\n* Charge an annual fee on health insurance providers.\n* Impose other taxes such as a 2.3% tax on manufacturers and importers of certain medical devices.\n\nMany people and politicians have sought to overturn the bill. Those that oppose the bill believe it violates an individual\u2019s right to choose whether to have insurance or not. In 2012, a number of states challenged the law on the basis that the individual mandate provision is unconstitutional. In June of 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a 5\u20134 decision that the individual mandate is actually a tax, so it is constitutional as the federal government has the right to tax the populace.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the Big Deal with Obamacare?\n\nWhat is it that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will actually do? To begin with, we should note that it is a massively complex law, with a large number of parts, some of which were implemented immediately, and others that will start every year from 2013 through 2020.\n\nAs noted in the chapter, people face ever-increasing healthcare costs in the United States. Those with health insurance demand more health care, pushing up the cost. This is one of the problems the ACA is attempting to fix, in part by introducing regulations designed to control increases in healthcare costs. One example is the regulation that caps the amount healthcare providers can spend on administrative costs. Another is a requirement that healthcare providers switch to electronic medical records (EMRs), which will reduce administrative costs.\n\nAnother component of the ACA is the requirement that states establish health insurance exchanges, or markets, where people without health insurance, and businesses that do not provide it for their employees, can shop for different insurance plans. Setting up these exchanges reduces the imperfections in the market for insurance and, by adding to the supply of insurance plans, may lead to lower prices if the supply increases more than demand. Also, people who are uninsured tend to use emergency rooms for treatment\u2014the most expensive form of healthcare. Given that there are over 40 million uninsured citizens in the United States, this has contributed significantly to rising costs. Capping administrative costs, requiring the use of EMRs, and establishing health insurance markets for those currently uninsured, are all components of the ACA that are intended to help control increases in healthcare costs.\n\nOver the years, the ranks of the uninsured in the United States have grown as rising prices, designed to offset the problem of distinguishing the high-risk from the low-risk person, have pushed employers and individuals out of the market. Also, insurance companies have increasingly used pre-existing conditions to determine if someone is high risk, and thus they either charge prices based on average costs, or they choose not to insure these groups. This has also contributed to the over 32 million uninsured. The ACA addresses this problem by providing that people with preexisting conditions cannot be denied health insurance.\n\nThis presents another selection problem because those with pre-existing conditions are a high-risk group. Taken as a separate group, the law of insurance says they should pay higher prices for insurance. Since they cannot be singled out, prices go up for everyone, and low-risk people leave the group. As the high-risk group gets sicker and more risky, prices go up again, and still more people leave the group, creating an upward spiral in prices. To offset this selection problem, the ACA includes an employer and individual mandate requirement. All businesses and individuals must purchase health insurance.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the actual impact of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is still unknown. Due to political opposition and some difficulties with meeting deadlines, several parts of the law have been delayed, and it will be some time before economists are able to collect enough data to determine whether the law has, in fact, increased coverage and lowered costs as was its intent.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nInsurance is a way of sharing risk. A group of people pay premiums for insurance against some unpleasant event, and those in the group who actually experience the unpleasant event then receive some compensation. The fundamental law of insurance is that what the average person pays in over time must be very similar to what the average person gets out. In an actuarially fair insurance policy, the premiums that a person pays to the insurance company are the same as the average amount of benefits for a person in that risk group. Moral hazard arises in insurance markets because those who are insured against a risk will have less reason to take steps to avoid the costs from that risk.\n\nMany insurance policies have deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance. A deductible is the maximum amount that the policyholder must pay out-of-pocket before the insurance company pays the rest of the bill. A copayment is a flat fee that an insurance policy-holder must pay before receiving services. Coinsurance requires the policyholder to pay a certain percentage of costs. Deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance reduce moral hazard by requiring the insured party to bear some of the costs before collecting insurance benefits.\n\nIn a fee-for-service health financing system, medical care providers are reimbursed according to the cost of services they provide. An alternative method of organizing health care is through health maintenance organizations (HMOs), where medical care providers are reimbursed according to the number of patients they handle, and it is up to the providers to allocate resources between patients who receive more or fewer health care services. Adverse selection arises in insurance markets when insurance buyers know more about the risks they face than does the insurance company. As a result, the insurance company runs the risk that low-risk parties will avoid its insurance because it is too costly for them, while high-risk parties will embrace it because it looks like a good deal to them.\n\n### Self-Check Question\n\n\n\nWhy is it difficult to measure health outcomes?\n\n\n\nIt is almost impossible to distinguish whether a health outcome such as life expectancy was the result of personal preferences that might affect health and longevity, such as diet, exercise, certain risky behavior, and consumption of certain items like tobacco, or the result of expenditures on health care (for example, annual check-ups).\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is an insurance premium?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an insurance system, would you expect each person to receive in benefits pretty much what they pay in premiums? Or is it just that the average benefits paid will equal the average premiums paid?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an actuarially fair insurance policy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the problem of moral hazard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can moral hazard lead to insurance being more costly than was expected?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance reduce moral hazard?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the key difference between a fee-for-service healthcare system and a system based on health maintenance organizations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow might adverse selection make it difficult for an insurance market to operate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the metrics used to measure health outcomes?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nHow do you think the problem of moral hazard might have affected the safety of sports such as football and boxing when safety regulations started requiring that players wear more padding?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo what sorts of customers would an insurance company offer a policy with a high copay? What about a high premium with a lower copay?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nImagine that 50-year-old men can be divided into two groups: those who have a family history of cancer and those who do not. For the purposes of this example, say that 20% of a group of 1,000 men have a family history of cancer, and these men have one chance in 50 of dying in the next year, while the other 80% of men have one chance in 200 of dying in the next year. The insurance company is selling a policy that will pay $100,000 to the estate of anyone who dies in the next year.\n\n1.  If the insurance company were selling life insurance separately to each group, what would be the actuarially fair premium for each group?\n2.  If an insurance company were offering life insurance to the entire group, but could not find out about family cancer histories, what would be the actuarially fair premium for the group as a whole?\n3.  What will happen to the insurance company if it tries to charge the actuarially fair premium to the group as a whole rather than to each group separately?\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency. \u201cThe World Factbook.\u201d https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html.\n\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners. \u201cNational Association of Insurance Commissioners &amp; The Center for Insurance Policy and Research.\u201d http://www.naic.org/.\n\nOECD. \u201cThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\u201d http://www.oecd.org/about/.\n\nUSA Today. 2015. \u201cUninsured Rates Drop Dramatically under Obamacare.\u201d Accessed April 1, 2015. http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/03/16/uninsured-rates-drop-sharply-under-obamacare/24852325/.\n\nThaler, Richard H., and Sendhil Mullainathan. \u201cThe Concise Encyclopedia of Economics: Behavioral Economics.\u201d *Library of Economics and Liberty*. http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/BehavioralEconomics.html.\n\nHenry J.

That means that the market prices of homes, less what was still owed on the loans used to buy these houses, equaled $13 trillion. This was a very good number, since the equity represented the value of the financial asset most U.S. citizens owned.\n\nHowever, by 2008 this number had gone down to $8.8 trillion, and it declined further still in 2009. Combined with the decline in value of other financial assets held by U.S. citizens, by 2010, U.S. homeowners\u2019 wealth had declined by $14 trillion! This is a staggering result, and it affected millions of lives: people had to alter their retirement decisions, housing decisions, and other important consumption decisions. Just about every other large economy in the world suffered a decline in the market value of financial assets, as a result of the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009.\n\nThis chapter will explain why people buy houses (other than as a place to live), why they buy other types of financial assets, and why businesses sell those financial assets in the first place. The chapter will also give us insight into why financial markets and assets go through boom and bust cycles like the one described here.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Financial Markets\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* How Businesses Raise Financial Capital\n* How Households Supply Financial Capital\n* How to Accumulate Personal Wealth\n\n\n\nWhen a firm needs to buy new equipment or build a new facility, it often must go to the financial market to raise funds. Usually firms will add capacity during an economic expansion when profits are on the rise and consumer demand is high. Business investment is one of the critical ingredients needed to sustain economic growth. Even in the sluggish economy of 2009, U.S. firms invested $1.4 trillion in new equipment and structures, in the hope that these investments would generate profits in the years ahead.\n\nBetween the end of the recession in 2009 through the second quarter 2013, profits for the S&amp;P 500 companies grew to 9.7 % despite the weak economy, with much of that amount driven by cost cutting and reductions in input costs, according to the *Wall Street Journal*. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C17_006) shows corporate profits after taxes (adjusted for inventory and capital consumption). Despite the steep decline in quarterly net profit in 2008, profits have recovered and surpassed pre-Recession levels.\n\n https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPATAX)\"){: #CNX_Econ_C17_006 data-title=\"Corporate Profits After Tax (Adjusted for Inventory and Capital Consumption)\"}\n\nMany firms, from huge companies like General Motors to startup firms writing computer software, do not have the financial resources within the firm to make all the desired investments. These firms need financial capital from outside investors, and they are willing to pay interest for the opportunity to get a rate of return on the investment for that financial capital.\n\nOn the other side of the financial capital market, suppliers of financial capital, like households, wish to use their savings in a way that will provide a return. Individuals cannot, however, take the few thousand dollars that they save in any given year, write a letter to General Motors or some other firm, and negotiate to invest their money with that firm. **Financial capital markets**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} bridge this gap: that is, they find ways to take the inflow of funds from many separate suppliers of financial capital and transform it into the funds desired by demanders of financial capital. Such financial markets include stocks, bonds, bank loans, and other financial investments.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read more about financial markets.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch17mod00_qr01\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nOur perspective then shifts to consider how these financial investments appear to suppliers of capital such as the households that are saving funds. Households have a range of investment options: bank accounts, certificates of deposit, money market mutual funds, bonds, stocks, stock and bond mutual funds, housing, and even tangible assets like gold. Finally, the chapter investigates two methods for becoming rich: a quick and easy method that does not work very well at all, and a slow, reliable method that can work very well indeed over a lifetime.\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/marketoverview", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48698", "module_title": "Economics - m48698", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48698", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Describe financial capital and how it relates to profits\n* Discuss the purpose and process of borrowing, bonds, and corporate stock\n* Explain how firms choose between sources of financial capital\n\n\n\nFirms often make decisions that involve spending money in the present and expecting to earn profits in the future. Examples include when a **firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} buys a machine that will last 10 years, or builds a new plant that will last for 30 years, or starts a research and development project. Firms can raise the financial capital they need to pay for such projects in four main ways: (1) from early-stage investors; (2) by reinvesting profits; (3) by borrowing through banks or bonds; and (4) by selling stock. When owners of a business choose sources of financial capital, they also choose how to pay for them.\n\n### Early Stage Financial Capital   {#ch17mod01_01}\n\nFirms that are just beginning often have an idea or a prototype for a product or service to sell, but few customers, or even no customers at all, and thus are not earning profits. Such firms face a difficult problem when it comes to raising financial capital: How can a firm that has not yet demonstrated any ability to earn profits pay a rate of return to financial investors?\n\nFor many small businesses, the original source of money is the owner of the business. Someone who decides to start a restaurant or a gas station, for instance, might cover the startup costs by dipping into his or her own bank account, or by borrowing money (perhaps using a home as collateral). Alternatively, many cities have a network of well-to-do individuals, known as \u201cangel investors,\u201d who will put their own money into small new companies at an early stage of development, in exchange for owning some portion of the firm.\n\n**Venture capital**{: data-type=\"term\"} firms make financial investments in new companies that are still relatively small in size, but that have potential to grow substantially. These firms gather money from a variety of individual or institutional investors, including banks, institutions like college endowments, insurance companies that hold financial reserves, and corporate pension funds. Venture capital firms do more than just supply money to small startups. They also provide advice on potential products, customers, and key employees. Typically, a venture capital fund invests in a number of firms, and then investors in that fund receive returns according to how the fund as a whole performs.\n\nThe amount of money invested in venture capital fluctuates substantially from year to year: as one example, venture capital firms invested more than $48.3 billion in 2014, according to the **National Venture Capital Association**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. All early-stage investors realize that the majority of small startup businesses will never hit it big; indeed, many of them will go out of business within a few months or years. They also know that getting in on the ground floor of a few huge successes like a Netflix or an Amazon.com can make up for a lot of failures. Early-stage investors are therefore willing to take large risks in order to be in a position to gain substantial returns on their investment.\n\n### Profits as a Source of Financial Capital   {#ch17mod01_02}\n\nIf firms are earning profits (their revenues are greater than costs), they can choose to reinvest some of these profits in equipment, structures, and research and development. For many established companies, reinvesting their own profits is one primary source of financial capital. Companies and firms just getting started may have numerous attractive investment opportunities, but few current profits to invest. Even large firms can experience a year or two of earning low profits or even suffering losses, but unless the firm can find a steady and reliable source of financial capital so that it can continue making real investments in tough times, the firm may not survive until better times arrive. Firms often need to find sources of financial capital other than profits.\n\n### Borrowing: Banks and Bonds   {#ch17mod01_03}\n\nWhen a firm has a record of at least earning significant revenues, and better still of earning profits, the firm can make a credible promise to pay interest, and so it becomes possible for the firm to borrow money. Firms have two main methods of borrowing: banks and bonds.\n\nA bank loan for a firm works in much the same way as a loan for an individual who is buying a car or a house. The firm borrows an amount of money and then promises to repay it, including some rate of interest, over a predetermined period of time. If the firm fails to make its loan payments, the bank (or banks) can often take the firm to court and require it to sell its buildings or equipment to make the loan payments.\n\nAnother source of financial capital is a bond. A **bond**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a financial contract: a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed and also a rate of interest over a period of time in the future. A **corporate bond**{: data-type=\"term\"} is issued by firms, but bonds are also issued by various levels of government. For example, a **municipal bond**{: data-type=\"term\"} is issued by cities, a state bond by U.S. states, and a **Treasury bond**{: data-type=\"term\"} by the federal government through the **U.S. Department of the Treasury**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. A bond specifies an amount that will be borrowed, the interest rate that will be paid, and the time until repayment.\n\nA large company, for example, might issue bonds for $10 million; the firm promises to make interest payments at an annual rate of 8%, or $800,000 per year and then, after 10 years, will repay the $10 million it originally borrowed. When a firm issues bonds, the total amount that is borrowed is divided up. A firm seeks to borrow $50 million by issuing bonds, might actually issue 10,000 bonds of $5,000 each. In this way, an individual investor could, in effect, loan the firm $5,000, or any multiple of that amount. Anyone who owns a bond and receives the interest payments is called a **bondholder**{: data-type=\"term\"}. If a firm issues bonds and fails to make the promised interest payments, the bondholders can take the firm to court and require it to pay, even if the firm needs to raise the money by selling buildings or equipment. However, there is no guarantee the firm will have sufficient assets to pay off the bonds. The bondholders may get back only a portion of what they loaned the firm.\n\nBank borrowing is more customized than issuing bonds, so it often works better for relatively small firms. The bank can get to know the firm extremely well\u2014often because the bank can monitor sales and expenses quite accurately by looking at deposits and withdrawals. Relatively large and well-known firms often issue bonds instead. They use bonds to raise new financial capital that pays for investments, or to raise capital to pay off old bonds, or to buy other firms. However, the idea that banks are usually used for relatively smaller loans and bonds for larger loans is not an ironclad rule: sometimes groups of banks make large loans and sometimes relatively small and lesser-known firms issue bonds.\n\n### Corporate Stock and Public Firms   {#ch17mod01_04}\n\nA **corporation**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a business that \u201cincorporates\u201d\u2014that is owned by shareholders that have limited liability for the debt of the company but share in its profits (and losses). Corporations may be private or public, and may or may not have stock that is publicly traded. They may raise funds to finance their operations or new investments by raising capital through the sale of stock or the issuance of bonds.\n\nThose who buy the stock become the owners, or **shareholders**{: data-type=\"term\"}, of the firm. **Stock**{: data-type=\"term\"} represents ownership of a firm; that is, a person who owns 100% of a company\u2019s stock, by definition, owns the entire company. The stock of a company is divided into **shares**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Corporate giants like IBM, AT&amp;T, Ford, General Electric, Microsoft, Merck, and Exxon all have millions of shares of stock. In most large and well-known firms, no individual owns a majority of the shares of the stock. Instead, large numbers of shareholders\u2014even those who hold thousands of shares\u2014each have only a small slice of the overall ownership of the firm.\n\nWhen a company is owned by a large number of shareholders, there are three questions to ask:\n\n1.  How and when does the company get money from the sale of its stock?\n2.  What rate of return does the company promise to pay when it sells stock?\n3.  Who makes decisions in a company owned by a large number of shareholders?\n{: .numeric}\n\nFirst, a firm receives money from the sale of its stock only when the company sells its own stock to the public (the public includes individuals, mutual funds, insurance companies, and pension funds). A firm\u2019s first sale of stock to the public is called an **initial public offering (IPO)**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The IPO is important for two reasons. For one, the IPO, and any stock issued thereafter, such as stock held as treasury stock (shares that a company keeps in their own treasury) or new stock issued later as a secondary offering, provides the funds to repay the early-stage investors, like the angel investors and the venture capital firms. A venture capital firm may have a 40% ownership in the firm. When the firm sells stock, the venture capital firm sells its part ownership of the firm to the public. A second reason for the importance of the IPO is that it provides the established company with financial capital for a substantial expansion of its operations.\n\nMost of the time when corporate stock is bought and sold, however, the firm receives no financial return at all. If you buy shares of stock in General Motors, you almost certainly buy them from the current owner of those shares, and General Motors does not receive any of your money. This pattern should not seem particularly odd. After all, if you buy a house, the current owner gets your money, not the original builder of the house. Similarly, when you buy shares of stock, you are buying a small slice of ownership of the firm from the existing owner\u2014and the firm that originally issued the stock is not a part of this transaction.\n\nSecond, when a firm decides to issue stock, it must recognize that investors will expect to receive a rate of return. That rate of return can come in two forms. A firm can make a direct payment to its shareholders, called a **dividend**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Alternatively, a financial investor might buy a share of stock in Wal-Mart for $45 and then later sell that share of stock to someone else for $60, for a gain of $15. The increase in the value of the stock (or of any asset) between when it is bought and when it is sold is called a **capital gain**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nThird: Who makes the decisions about when a firm will issue stock, or pay dividends, or re-invest profits? To understand the answers to these questions, it is useful to separate firms into two groups: private and public.\n\nA **private company**{: data-type=\"term\"} is owned by the people who run it on a day-to-day basis. A private company can be run by individuals, in which case it is called a **sole proprietorship**{: data-type=\"term\"}, or it can be run by a group, in which case it is a **partnership**{: data-type=\"term\"}. A private company can also be a corporation, but with no publicly issued stock. A small law firm run by one person, even if it employs some other lawyers, would be a sole proprietorship. A larger law firm may be owned jointly by its partners. Most private companies are relatively small, but there are some large private corporations, with tens of billions of dollars in annual sales, that do not have publicly issued stock, such as farm products dealer Cargill, the Mars candy company, and the Bechtel engineering and construction firm.\n\nWhen a firm decides to sell stock, which in turn can be bought and sold by financial investors, it is called a **public company**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Shareholders own a public company. Since the shareholders are a very broad group, often consisting of thousands or even millions of investors, the shareholders vote for a board of directors, who in turn hire top executives to run the firm on a day-to-day basis. The more shares of stock a shareholder owns, the more votes that shareholder is entitled to cast for the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\nIn theory, the board of directors helps to ensure that the firm is run in the interests of the true owners\u2014the shareholders. However, the top executives who run the firm have a strong voice in choosing the candidates who will be on their board of directors. After all, few shareholders are knowledgeable enough or have enough of a personal incentive to spend energy and money nominating alternative members of the board.\n\n### How Firms Choose between Sources of Financial Capital   {#ch17mod01_05}\n\nThere are clear patterns in how businesses raise financial capital. These patterns can be explained in terms of imperfect information, which as discussed in [Information, Risk, and Insurance](/m48694){: .target-chapter}, is a situation where buyers and sellers in a market do not both have full and equal information. Those who are actually running a firm will almost always have more information about whether the firm is likely to earn profits in the future than outside investors who provide financial capital.\n\nAny young startup firm is a risk; indeed, some startup firms are only a little more than an idea on paper. The firm\u2019s founders inevitably have better information about how hard they are willing to work, and whether the firm is likely to succeed, than anyone else. When the founders put their own money into the firm, they demonstrate a belief in its prospects. At this early stage, angel investors and venture capitalists try to overcome the imperfect information, at least in part, by knowing the managers and their business plan personally and by giving them advice.\n\nAccurate information is sometimes not available because **corporate governance**{: data-type=\"term\"}, the name economists give to the institutions that are supposed to watch over top executives, fails, as the following Clear It Up feature on Lehman Brothers shows.\n\n\n\nHow did lack of corporate governance lead to the Lehman Brothers failure?\n\nIn 2008, Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest U.S. investment bank, with 25,000 employees. The firm had been in business for 164 years. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. There are many causes of the Lehman Brothers failure. One area of apparent failure was the lack of oversight by the Board of Directors to keep managers from undertaking excessive risk. Part of the oversight failure, according to Tim Geithner\u2019s April 10, 2010, testimony to Congress, can be attributed to the Executive Compensation Committee\u2019s emphasis on short-term gains without enough consideration of the risks. In addition, according to the court examiner\u2019s report, the Lehman Brother\u2019s Board of Directors paid too little attention to the details of the operations of Lehman Brothers and also had limited financial service experience.\n\nThe board of directors, elected by the shareholders, is supposed to be the first line of corporate governance and oversight for top executives. A second institution of corporate governance is the auditing firm hired to go over the financial records of the company and certify that everything looks reasonable. A third institution of corporate governance is outside investors, especially large shareholders like those who invest large mutual funds or pension funds. In the case of Lehman Brothers, corporate governance failed to provide investors with accurate financial information about the firm\u2019s operations.\n\n\n\nAs a firm becomes at least somewhat established and its strategy appears likely to lead to profits in the near future, knowing the individual managers and their business plans on a personal basis becomes less important, because information has become more widely available regarding the company\u2019s products, revenues, costs, and profits. As a result, other outside investors who do not know the managers personally, like bondholders and shareholders, are more willing to provide financial capital to the firm.\n\nAt this point, a firm must often choose how to access financial capital. It may choose to borrow from a bank, issue bonds, or issue stock. The great disadvantage of borrowing money from a bank or issuing bonds is that the firm commits to scheduled interest payments, whether or not it has sufficient income. The great advantage of borrowing money is that the firm maintains control of its operations and is not subject to shareholders. Issuing stock involves selling off ownership of the company to the public and becoming responsible to a board of directors and the shareholders.\n\nThe benefit of issuing stock is that a small and growing firm increases its visibility in the financial markets and can access large amounts of financial capital for expansion, without worrying about paying this money back. If the firm is successful and profitable, the board of directors will need to decide upon a dividend payout or how to reinvest profits to further grow the company. Issuing and placing stock is expensive, requires the expertise of investment bankers and attorneys, and entails compliance with reporting requirements to shareholders and government agencies, such as the federal Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch17mod01_summ}\n\nCompanies can raise early-stage financial capital in several ways: from their owners\u2019 or managers\u2019 personal savings, or credit cards and from private investors like angel investors and venture capital firms.\n\nA bond is a financial contract through which a borrower agrees to repay the amount that was borrowed. A bond specifies an amount that will be borrowed, the amounts that will be repaid over time based on the interest rate when the bond is issued, and the time until repayment. Corporate bonds are issued by firms; municipal bonds are issued by cities, state bonds by U.S. states, and Treasury bonds by the federal government through the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n\nStock represents ownership of a firm. The stock of a company is divided into shares. A firm receives financial capital when it sells stock to the public. A company\u2019s first sale of stock to the public is called the initial public offering (IPO). However, a firm does not receive any funds when one shareholder sells stock in the firm to another investor. The rate of return on stock is received in two forms: dividends and capital gains.\n\nA private company is usually owned by the people who run it on a day-to-day basis, although it can be run by hired managers. A private company owned and run by an individual is called a sole proprietorship, while a firm owned run by a group is called a partnership. When a firm decides to sell stock that can be bought and sold by financial investors, then the firm is owned by its shareholders\u2014who in turn elect a board of directors to hire top day-to-day management\u2014and is called a public company. Corporate governance is the name economists give to the institutions that are supposed to watch over top executives, though it does not always work.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch17mod01_sques}\n\n\n\nAnswer these three questions about early-stage corporate finance:\n\n1.  Why do very small companies tend to raise money from private investors instead of through an IPO?\n2.  Why do small, young companies often prefer an IPO to borrowing from a bank or issuing bonds?\n3.  Who has better information about whether a small firm is likely to earn profits, a venture capitalist or a potential bondholder, and why?\n{: type=\"a\" .lower-alpha}\n\n\n\n1.  The management of small companies might rather do an IPO right away, but until they get the company up and running, most people would pay very much for the stock because of the risks involved.\n2.  A small company may be earning few or zero profits, and its owners want to reinvest their earnings in the future growth of the company. If this company issues bonds or borrows money, it is obligated to make interest payments, which can eat up the company\u2019s cash. If the company issues stock, it is not obligated to make payments to anyone (although it may choose to pay dividends).\n3.  Venture capitalists are private investors who can keep close tabs on the management and strategy of the company\u2014and thus reduce the problems of imperfect information about whether the firm is being well run. Venture capitalists often own a substantial portion of the firm and have much better information than a typical shareholder would.\n{: type=\"a\" .lower-alpha}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a firm\u2019s point of view, how is a bond similar to a bank loan? How are they different?\n\n\n\nFrom a firm\u2019s point of view, a bond is very similar to a bank loan. Both are ways of borrowing money. Both require paying interest. The major difference is who must be persuaded to lend money: a bank loan requires persuading the bank, while issuing bonds requires persuading a number of separate bondholders. Since a bank often knows a great deal about a firm (especially if the firm has its accounts with that bank), bank loans are more common where imperfect information would otherwise be a problem.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch17mod01_rques}\n\n\n\nWhat are the most common ways for start-up firms to raise financial capital?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy can firms not just use their own profits for financial capital, with no need for outside investors?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are banks more willing to lend to well-established firms?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a bond?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does a share of stock represent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen do firms receive money from the sale of stock in their firm and when do they not receive money?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a dividend?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a capital gain?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a private company and a public company?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do the shareholders who own a company choose the actual managers of the company?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#ch17mod01_ctques}\n\n\n\nIf you owned a small firm that had become somewhat established, but you needed a surge of financial capital to carry out a major expansion, would you prefer to raise the funds through borrowing or by issuing stock?

The other half is what those households and individuals who supply funds desire, and how they perceive the available choices. The focus of our discussion now shifts from firms on the demand side of financial capital markets to households on the supply side of those markets. The mechanisms for saving available to households can be divided into several categories: deposits in bank accounts; bonds; stocks; money market mutual funds; stock and bond mutual funds; and housing and other tangible assets like owning gold. Each of these investments needs to be analyzed in terms of three factors: (1) the expected rate of return it will pay; (2) the risk that the return will be much lower or higher than expected; and (3) the **liquidity**{: data-type=\"term\"} of the investment, which refers to how easily money or financial assets can be exchanged for a good or service. We will do this analysis as we discuss each of these investments in the sections below. First, however, we need to understand the difference between expected rate of return, risk, and actual rate of return.\n\n### Expected Rate of Return, Risk, and Actual Rate of Return   {#ch17mod02_01}\n\nThe **expected rate of return**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to how much a project or an investment is expected to return to the investor, either in future interest payments, capital gains, or increased profitability. It is usually the average return over a period of time, usually in years or even decades. **Risk**{: data-type=\"term\"} measures the uncertainty of that project\u2019s profitability. There are several types of risk, including default risk and interest rate risk. Default risk, as its name suggests, is the risk that the borrower fails to pay back the bond. Interest rate risk is the danger that you might buy a long term bond at a 6% interest rate right before market rates suddenly raise, so had you waited, you could have gotten a similar bond that paid 9%. A high-risk investment is one for which a wide range of potential payoffs is reasonably probable. A low-risk investment will have actual returns that are fairly close to its expected rate of return year after year. A high-risk investment will have actual returns that are much higher than the expected rate of return in some months or years and much lower in other months or years. The **actual rate of return**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to the total rate of return, including capital gains and interest paid on an investment at the end of a period of time.\n\n### Bank Accounts   {#ch17mod02_02}\n\nAn intermediary is one who stands between two other parties; for example, a person who arranges a blind date between two other people is one kind of intermediary. In financial capital markets, banks are an example of a **financial intermediary**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014that is, an institution that operates between a saver who deposits funds in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank. When a bank serves as a financial intermediary, unlike the situation with a couple on a blind date, the saver and the borrower never meet. In fact, it is not even possible to make direct connections between those who deposit funds in banks and those who borrow from banks, because all funds deposited end up in one big pool, which is then loaned out.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C17_001) illustrates the position of banks as a financial intermediary, with a pattern of deposits flowing into a bank and loans flowing out, and then repayment of the loans flowing back to the bank, with interest payments for the original savers.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C17_001 data-title=\"Banks as Financial Intermediaries\"}\n\nBanks offer a range of accounts to serve different needs. A **checking account**{: data-type=\"term\"} typically pays little or no interest, but it facilitates transactions by giving you easy access to your money, either by writing a check or by using a **debit card**{: data-type=\"term\"} (that is, a card which works like a credit card, except that purchases are immediately deducted from your checking account rather than being billed separately through a credit card company). A **savings account**{: data-type=\"term\"} typically pays some interest rate, but getting the money typically requires you to make a trip to the bank or an automatic teller machine (or you can access the funds electronically). The lines between checking and savings accounts have blurred in the last couple of decades, as many banks offer checking accounts that will pay an interest rate similar to a savings account if you keep a certain minimum amount in the account, or conversely, offer savings accounts that allow you to write at least a few checks per month.\n\nAnother way to deposit savings at a bank is to use a **certificate of deposit (CD)**{: data-type=\"term\"}. With a CD, as it is commonly called, you agree to deposit a certain amount of money, often measured in thousands of dollars, in the account for a stated period of time, typically ranging from a few months to several years. In exchange, the bank agrees to pay a higher interest rate than for a regular savings account. While you can withdraw the money before the allotted time, as the advertisements for CDs always warn, there is \u201ca substantial penalty for early withdrawal.\u201d\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C17_007) shows the annual rate of interest paid on a six-month, one-year, and five-year CD since 1984, as reported by Bankrate.com. The interest rates paid by savings accounts are typically a little lower than the CD rate, because financial investors need to receive a slightly higher rate of interest as compensation for promising to leave deposits untouched for a period of time in a CD, and thus giving up some liquidity.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C17_007 data-title=\"Interest Rates on Six-Month, One-Year, and Five-Year Certificates of Deposit\"}\n\nThe great advantages of bank accounts are that financial investors have very easy access to their money, and also money in bank accounts is extremely safe. In part, this safety arises because a bank account offers more security than keeping a few thousand dollars in the toe of a sock in your underwear drawer. In addition, the **Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} protects the savings of the average person. Every bank is required by law to pay a fee to the FDIC, based on the size of its deposits. Then, if a bank should happen to go bankrupt and not be able to repay depositors, the FDIC guarantees that all customers will receive their deposits back up to $250,000.\n\nThe bottom line on bank accounts looks like this: low risk means low rate of return but high liquidity.\n\n### Bonds   {#ch17mod02_03}\n\nAn investor who buys a bond expects to receive a rate of return. However, bonds vary in the rates of return that they offer, according to the riskiness of the borrower. An interest rate can always be divided up into three components (as explained in [Choice in a World of Scarcity](/m48602){: .target-chapter}): compensation for delaying consumption, an adjustment for an inflationary rise in the overall level of prices, and a risk premium that takes the borrower\u2019s riskiness into account.\n\nThe U.S. government is considered to be an extremely safe borrower, so when the U.S. government issues Treasury bonds, it can pay a relatively low rate of interest. Firms that appear to be safe borrowers, perhaps because of their sheer size or because they have consistently earned profits over time, will still pay a higher interest rate than the U.S. government. Firms that appear to be riskier borrowers, perhaps because they are still growing or their businesses appear shaky, will pay the highest interest rates when they issue bonds. Bonds that offer high interest rates to compensate for their relatively high chance of default are called **high yield**{: data-type=\"term\"} **bonds**{: data-type=\"term\"} or **junk bonds**{: data-type=\"term\"}. A number of today\u2019s well-known firms issued junk bonds in the 1980s when they were starting to grow, including Turner Broadcasting and Microsoft.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read about Treasury bonds.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch17mod02_qr01\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nA bond issued by the U.S. government or a large corporation may seem to be relatively low risk: after all, the issuer of the bond has promised to make certain payments over time, and except for rare cases of bankruptcy, these payments will be made. If the issuer of a corporate bond fails to make the payments that it owes to its bondholders, the bondholders can require that the company declare bankruptcy, sell off its assets, and pay them as much as it can. Even in the case of junk bonds, a wise investor can reduce the risk by purchasing bonds from a wide range of different companies since, even if a few firms go broke and do not pay, they are not all likely to go bankrupt.\n\nAs we noted before, bonds carry an interest rate risk. For example, imagine you decide to buy a 10-year bond that would pay an annual interest rate of 8%. Soon after you buy the bond, interest rates on bonds rise, so that now similar companies are paying an annual rate of 12%. Anyone who buys a bond now can receive annual payments of $120 per year, but since your bond was issued at an interest rate of 8%, you have tied up $1,000 and receive payments of only $80 per year. In the meaningful sense of opportunity cost, you are missing out on the higher payments that you could have received. Furthermore, the amount you should be willing to pay now for future payments can be calculated. To place a present discounted value on a future payment, decide what you would need in the present to equal a certain amount in the future. This calculation will require an interest rate. For example, if the interest rate is 25%, then a payment of $125 a year from now will have a present discounted value of $100\u2014that is, you could take $100 in the present and have $125 in the future. (This is discussed further in the appendix on [Present Discounted Value](/m48834).)\n\nIn financial terms, a bond has several parts. A bond is basically an \u201cI owe you\u201d note that is given to an investor in exchange for capital (money). The bond has a **face value**{: data-type=\"term\"}. This is the amount the borrower agrees to pay the investor at maturity. The bond has a **coupon rate**{: data-type=\"term\"} or interest rate, which is usually semi-annual, but can be paid at different times throughout the year. (Bonds used to be paper documents with coupons that were clipped and turned in to the bank to receive interest.) The bond has a **maturity date**{: data-type=\"term\"} when the borrower will pay back its face value as well as its last interest payment. Combining the bond\u2019s face value, interest rate, and maturity date, and market interest rates, allows a buyer to compute a bond\u2019s **present value**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is the most that a buyer would be willing to pay for a given bond. This may or may not be the same as the face value.\n\nThe **bond yield**{: data-type=\"term\"} measures the rate of return a bond is expected to pay over time. Bonds are bought not only when they are issued; they are also bought and sold during their lifetimes. When buying a bond that has been around for a few years, investors should know that the interest rate printed on a bond is often not the same as the bond yield, even on new bonds. Read the next Work It Out feature to see how this happens.\n\n\n\nCalculating the Bond Yield\n\nYou have bought a $1,000 bond whose coupon rate is 8%. To calculate your return or yield, follow these steps:\n\n1.  Assume the following:\n    * * *\n    {: data-type=\"newline\"}\n    \n    Face value of a bond: $1,000\n    * * *\n    {: data-type=\"newline\"}\n    \n    Coupon rate: 8 %\n    * * *\n    {: data-type=\"newline\"}\n    \n    Annual payment: $80 per year\n2.  Consider the risk of the bond. If this bond carries no risk, then it would be safe to assume that the bond will sell for $1,000 when it is issued and pay the purchaser $80 per year until its maturity, at which time the final interest payment will be made and the original $1,000 will be repaid. Now, assume that over time the interest rates prevailing in the economy rise to 12% and that there is now only one year left to this bond\u2019s maturity. This makes the bond an unattractive investment, since an investor can find another bond that perhaps pays 12%. To induce the investor to buy the 8% bond, the bond seller will lower its price below its face value of $1,000.\n3.  Calculate the price of the bond when its interest rate is less than the market interest rate. The expected payments from the bond one year from now are $1,080, because in the bond\u2019s last year the issuer of the bond will make the final interest payment and then also repay the original $1,000. Given that interest rates are now 12%, you know that you could invest $964 in an alternative investment and receive $1,080 a year from now; that is, $964(1 + 0.12) = $1080. Therefore, you will not pay more than $964 for the original $1,000 bond.\n4.  Consider that the investor will receive the $1,000 face value, plus $80 for the last year\u2019s interest payment. The yield on the bond will be ($1080 \u2013 $964)/$964 = 12%. The yield, or total return, means interest payments, plus capital gains. Note that the interest or coupon rate of 8% did not change. When interest rates rise, bonds previously issued at lower interest rates will sell for less than face value. Conversely, when interest rates fall, bonds previously issued at higher interest rates will sell for more than face value.\n{: type=\"1\" .stepwise}\n\n\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C17_003) shows bond yield for two kinds of bonds: 10-year Treasury bonds (which are officially called \u201cnotes\u201d) and corporate bonds issued by firms that have been given an AAA rating as relatively safe borrowers by **Moody\u2019s**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, an independent firm that publishes such ratings. Even though corporate bonds pay a higher interest rate, because firms are riskier borrowers than the federal government, the rates tend to rise and fall together. Treasury bonds typically pay more than bank accounts, and corporate bonds typically pay a higher interest rate than Treasury bonds.\n\n rise and fall together, depending on conditions for borrowers and lenders in financial markets for borrowing. The corporate bonds always pay a higher interest rate, to make up for the higher risk they have of defaulting compared with the U.S. government.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C17_003 data-title=\"Interest Rates for Corporate Bonds and Ten-Year U.S. Treasury Bonds\"}\n\nThe bottom line for bonds: rate of return\u2014low to moderate, depending on the risk of the borrower; risk\u2014low to moderate, depending on whether interest rates in the economy change substantially after the bond is issued; liquidity\u2014moderate, because the bond needs to be sold before the investor regains the cash.\n\n### Stocks   {#ch17mod02_04}\n\nAs stated earlier, the rate of return on a financial investment in a share of stock can come in two forms: as dividends paid by the firm and as a capital gain achieved by selling the stock for more than you paid. The range of possible returns from buying stock is mind-bending. Firms can decide to pay dividends or not. A stock price can rise to a multiple of its original price or sink all the way to zero. Even in short periods of time, well-established companies can see large movements in the price of their stock. For example, in July 1, 2011, Netflix stock peaked at $295 per share; one year later, on July 30, 2012, it was at $53.91 per share; in 2015, it had recovered to $414. When Facebook went public, its shares of stock sold for around $40 per share, but in 2015, they were selling for slightly over $83.\n\nThe reasons why stock prices fall and rise so abruptly will be discussed below, but first you need to know how we measure stock market performance. There are a number of different ways of measuring the overall performance of the stock market, based on averaging the stock prices of different subsets of companies. Perhaps the best-known measure of the stock markets is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is based on the stock prices of 30 large U.S. companies. Another gauge of stock market performance, the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500, follows the stock prices of the 500 largest U.S. companies. The Wilshire 5000 tracks the stock prices of essentially all U.S. companies that have stock the public can buy and sell.\n\nOther measures of stock markets focus on where stocks are traded. For example, the New York Stock Exchange monitors the performance of stocks that are traded on that exchange in New York City. The Nasdaq stock market includes about 3,600 stocks, with a concentration of technology stocks.

[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C17_004) shows that stock prices did not rise much in the 1970s, but then started a steady climb in the 1980s. From 2000 to 2013, stock prices bounced up and down, but ended up at about the same level.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C17_004 data-title=\"The Dow Jones Industrial Index and the Standard &amp; Poor&#x2019;s 500, 1965&#x2013;2013\"}\n\n[\\[link\\]](#ch17mod02_tab02) shows the total annual rate of return an investor would have received from buying the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index over recent decades. The total return here includes both dividends paid by these companies and also capital gains arising from increases in the value of the stock. (For technical reasons related to how the numbers are calculated, the dividends and capital gains do not add exactly to the total return.) From the 1950s to the 1980s, the average firm paid annual dividends equal to about 4% of the value of its stock. Since the 1990s, dividends have dropped and now often provide a return closer to 1% to 2%. In the 1960s and 1970s, the gap between percent earned on capital gains and dividends was much closer than it has been since the 1980s. In the 1980s and 1990s, however, capital gains were far higher than dividends. In the 2000s, dividends remained low and, while stock prices fluctuated, they ended the decade roughly where they had started.\n\n<table id=\"ch17mod02_tab02\" summary=\"Table 1.2: Annual Returns on S and P 500 Stocks, 1950-2012.

The market value of individual companies can rise and fall substantially, both over short time periods and over the long run. During extended periods of time like the 1970s or the first decade of the 2000s, the overall return on the stock market can be quite modest. The stock market can sometimes fall sharply, as it did in 2008.\n\nThe bottom line on investing in stocks is that the rate of return over time will be high, but the risks are also high, especially in the short run; liquidity is also high since stock in publicly held companies can be readily sold for spendable money.\n\n### Mutual Funds   {#ch17mod02_05}\n\nBuying stocks or bonds issued by a single company is always somewhat risky. An individual firm may find itself buffeted by unfavorable supply and demand conditions or hurt by unlucky or unwise managerial decisions. Thus, a standard recommendation from financial investors is **diversification**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which means buying stocks or bonds from a wide range of companies. A saver who diversifies is following the old proverb: \u201cDon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.\u201d In any broad group of companies, some firms will do better than expected and some will do worse\u2014but the extremes have a tendency to cancel out extreme increases and decreases in value.\n\nPurchasing a diversified group of the stocks or bonds has gotten easier in the Internet age, but it remains something of a task. To simplify the process, companies offer **mutual funds**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which are organizations that buy a range of stocks or bonds from different companies. The financial investor buys shares of the mutual fund, and then receives a return based on how the fund as a whole performs. In 2012, according to the Investment Company Factbook, about 44% of U.S. households had a financial investment in a mutual fund\u2014including many people who have their retirement savings or pension money invested in this way.\n\nMutual funds can be focused in certain areas: one mutual fund might invest only in stocks of companies based in Indonesia, or only in bonds issued by large manufacturing companies, or only in stock of biotechnology companies. At the other end of the spectrum, a mutual fund might be quite broad; at the extreme, some mutual funds own a tiny share of every firm in the stock market, and thus the value of the mutual fund will fluctuate with the average of the overall stock market. A mutual fund that seeks only to mimic the overall performance of the market is called an **index fund**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nDiversification can offset some of the risks of individual stocks rising or falling. Even investors who buy an indexed mutual fund designed to mimic some measure of the broad stock market, like the Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s 500, had better buckle their seatbelts against some ups and downs, like those the stock market experienced in the first decade of the 2000s. In 2008 average U.S. stock funds declined 38%, reducing the wealth of individuals and households. This steep drop in value hit hardest those who were close to retirement and were counting on their stock funds to supplement retirement income.\n\nThe bottom line on investing in mutual funds is that the rate of return over time will be high; the risks are also high, but the risks and returns for an individual mutual fund will be lower than those for an individual stock. As with stocks, liquidity is also high provided the mutual fund or stock index fund is readily traded.\n\n### Housing and Other Tangible Assets   {#ch17mod02_06}\n\nHouseholds can also seek a rate of return by purchasing tangible assets, especially housing. About two-thirds of U.S. households own their own home. An owner\u2019s **equity**{: data-type=\"term\"} in a house is the monetary value the owner would have after selling the house and repaying any outstanding bank loans used to buy the house. For example, imagine that you buy a house for $200,000, paying 10% of the price as a down payment and taking out a bank loan for the remaining $180,000. Over time, you pay off some of your bank loan, so that only $100,000 remains, and the value of the house on the market rises to $250,000. At that point, your equity in the home is the value of the home minus the value of the loan outstanding, which is $150,000. For many middle-class Americans, home equity is their single greatest financial asset. The total value of all home equity held by U.S. households was $11.3 trillion at the end of 2015, according to Federal Reserve Data.\n\nInvestment in a house is tangibly different from bank accounts, stocks, and bonds because a house offers both a financial and a nonfinancial return. If you buy a house to live in, part of the return on your investment occurs from your consumption of \u201chousing services\u201d\u2014that is, having a place to live. (Of course, if you buy a home and rent it out, you receive rental payments for the housing services you provide, which would offer a financial return.) Buying a house to live in also offers the possibility of a capital gain from selling the house in the future for more than you paid for it. There can, however, be different outcomes, as the Clear It Up on the housing market shows.\n\nHousing prices have usually risen steadily over time; for example, the median sales price for an existing one-family home was $122,900 in 1990, but $294,000 in 2015. Over these 23 years, home prices increased an average of 3.1% per year, which is an average financial return over this time. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C17_005) shows U.S. Census data for the median average sales price of a house in the United States over this time period.\n\n\nGo to this [website][2] to experiment with a compound annual growth rate calculator.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch17mod02_qr02\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nHowever, the possible capital gains from rising housing prices are riskier than these national price averages. Certain regions of the country or metropolitan areas have seen drops in housing prices over time. The median housing price for the United States as a whole fell almost 7% in 2008 and again in 2009, dropping the median price from $247,900 to $216,700. As of 2015, home values had almost recovered to their pre-recession levels.\n\n\nVisit this [website][3] to watch the trailer for *Inside Job*, a movie that explores the modern financial crisis.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch17mod02_qr03\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C17_005 data-title=\"The Median Average Sales Price for New Single-Family Homes, 1990&#x2013;2015\"}\n\nInvestors can also put money into other tangible assets such as gold, silver, and other precious metals, or in duller commodities like sugar, cocoa, coffee, orange juice, oil, and natural gas. The return on these investments derives from the saver\u2019s hope of buying low, selling high, and receiving a capital gain. Investing in, say, gold or coffee offers relatively little in the way of nonfinancial benefits to the user (unless the investor likes to caress gold or gaze upon a warehouse full of coffee). Indeed, typically investors in these commodities never even see the physical goods; instead, they sign a contract that takes ownership of a certain quantity of these commodities, which are stored in a warehouse, and later they sell the ownership to someone else. As one example, from 1981 to 2005, the price of gold generally fluctuated between about $300 and $500 per ounce, but then rose sharply to over $1,100 per ounce by early 2010.\n\nA final area of tangible assets are \u201ccollectibles\u201d like paintings, fine wine, jewelry, antiques, or even baseball cards. Most collectibles provide returns both in the form of services or of a potentially higher selling price in the future. You can use paintings by hanging them on the wall; jewelry by wearing it; baseball cards by displaying them. You can also hope to sell them someday for more than you paid for them. However, the evidence on prices of collectibles, while scanty, is that while they may go through periods where prices skyrocket for a time, you should not expect to make a higher-than-average rate of return over a sustained period of time from investing in this way.\n\nThe bottom line on investing in tangible assets: rate of return\u2014moderate, especially if you can receive nonfinancial benefits from, for example, living in the house; risk\u2014moderate for housing or high if you buy gold or baseball cards; liquidity\u2014low, because it often takes considerable time and energy to sell a house or a piece of fine art and turn your capital gain into cash. The next Clear It Up feature explains the issues in the recent U.S. housing market crisis.\n\n\n\nWhat was all the commotion in the recent U.S. housing market?\n\nThe cumulative average growth rate in housing prices from 1981 to 2000 was 5.1%. The price of an average U.S. home then took off from 2003 to 2005, rising at more than 10% per year. No serious analyst believed this rate of growth was sustainable; after all, if housing prices grew at, say, 11% per year over time, the average price of a home would more than double every seven years. However, at the time many serious analysts saw no reason for deep concern. After all, housing prices often change in fits and starts, like all prices, and a price surge for a few years is often followed by prices that are flat or even declining a bit as local markets adjust.\n\nThe sharp rise in housing prices was driven by a high level of demand for housing. Interest rates were low, so people were encouraged to borrow money to buy a house. Banks became much more flexible in their lending, making what were called \u201csubprime\u201d loans. Banks loaned money with low, or sometimes no, down payment. They offered loans with very low payments for the first two years, but then much higher payments after that; the idea was that housing prices would keep rising, so the borrower would just refinance the mortgage two years in the future, and thus would not ever have to make the higher payments. Some banks even offered so-called NINJA loans, which meant a loan given even though the borrower had No Income, No Job or Assets.\n\nIn retrospect, these loans seem nearly crazy. Many borrowers figured, however, that as long as housing prices kept rising, it made sense to buy. Many lenders used a process called \u201csecuritizing,\u201d in which they sold their mortgages to financial companies, which put all the mortgages into a big pool, creating large financial securities, and then re-sold these mortgage-backed securities to investors. In this way, the lenders off-loaded the risks of the mortgages to investors. Investors were interested in mortgage-backed securities as they appeared to offer a steady stream of income, provided the mortgages were repaid. Investors relied on the ratings agencies to assess the credit risk associated with the mortgage backed securities. In hindsight, it appears that the credit agencies were far too lenient in their ratings of many of the securitized loans. Bank and financial regulators watched the steady rise in the market for mortgage-backed securities, but saw no reason at the time to intervene.\n\nWhen housing prices turned down, many households that had borrowed when prices were high found that what they owed the bank was more than their home was worth. Many banks believed that they had diversified by selling their individual loans and instead buying securities based on mortgage loans from all over the country. After all, banks thought back in 2005, the average price of a house had not declined at any time since the Great Depression of the 1930s. These securities based on mortgage loans, however, turned out to be far riskier than expected. The bust in housing prices weakened the finances of both banks and households, and thus helped bring on the Great Recession of 2008\u20132009.\n\n\n\n### The Tradeoffs between Return and Risk   {#ch17mod02_07}\n\nThe discussion of financial investments has emphasized the expected rate of return, the risk, and the liquidity of each investment. [\\[link\\]](#ch17mod02_tab03) summarizes these characteristics.\n\n<table id=\"ch17mod02_tab03\" summary=\"Table 1.3: Key Characteristics for Financial Investments.

Bank accounts have very low risk and very low returns; bonds have higher risk but higher returns; and stocks are riskiest of all but have the potential for still higher returns. In effect, the higher average return compensates for the higher degree of risk. If risky assets like stocks did not also offer a higher average return, then few investors would want them.\n\nThis tradeoff between return and risk complicates the task of any financial investor: Is it better to invest safely or to take a risk and go for the high return? Ultimately, choices about risk and return will be based on personal preferences. However, it is often useful to examine risk and return in the context of different time frames.\n\nThe high returns of stock market investments refer to a high average return that can be expected over a period of several years or decades. The high risk of such investments refers to the fact that in shorter time frames, from months to a few years, the rate of return may fluctuate a great deal. Thus, a person near retirement age, who already owns a house, may prefer reduced risk and certainty about retirement income. For young workers, just starting to make a reasonably profitable living, it may make sense to put most of their savings for retirement in stocks. Stocks are risky in the short term, to be sure, but when the worker can look forward to several decades during which stock market ups and downs can even out, stocks will typically pay a much higher return over that extended period than will bonds or bank accounts. Thus, tradeoffs between risk and return must be considered in the context of where the investor is in life.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch08mod04_summ}\n\nAll investments can be categorized according to three key characteristics: average expected return, degree of risk, and liquidity. To get a higher rate of return, an investor must typically accept either more risk or less liquidity. Banks are an example of a financial intermediary, an institution that operates to coordinate supply and demand in the financial capital market. Banks offer a range of accounts, including checking accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit. Under the federal deposit insurance program, banks purchase insurance against the risk of a bank failure.\n\nA typical bond promises the financial investor a series of payments over time, based on the interest rate at the time the bond is issued, and then repayment of what was borrowed. Bonds that offer a high rate of return but also a relatively high chance of defaulting on the payments are called high yield or junk bonds. The bond yield is the rate of return that a bond promises to pay at the time of purchase. Even when bonds make payments based on a fixed rate of interest, they are somewhat risky, because if interest rates rise for the economy as a whole, an investor who owns bonds issued at lower interest rates is now locked into the low rate and suffers a loss.\n\nChanges in the price of a stock depend on changes in expectations about future profits. Investing in any individual firm is somewhat risky, so investors are wise to practice diversification, which means investing in a range of companies. A mutual fund purchases an array of stocks and/or bonds. An investor in the mutual fund then receives a return depending on the overall performance of the investments made by the fund as a whole. A mutual fund that seeks to imitate the overall behavior of the stock market is called an index fund.\n\nHousing and other tangible assets can also be regarded as forms of financial investment, which pay a rate of return in the form of capital gains. Housing can also offer a nonfinancial return\u2014specifically, you can live in it.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch17mod02_sques}\n\n\n\nCalculate the equity each of these people has in his or her home:\n\n1.  Fred just bought a house for $200,000 by putting 10% as a down payment and borrowing the rest from the bank.\n2.  Freda bought a house for $150,000 in cash, but if she were to sell it now, it would sell for $250,000.\n3.  Frank bought a house for $100,000. He put 20% down and borrowed the rest from the bank. However, the value of the house has now increased to $160,000 and he has paid off $20,000 of the bank loan.\n{: type=\"a\" .lower-alpha}\n\n\n\n1.  Remember, equity is the market value of the house minus what is still owed to the bank. Thus: the value of the house is $200,000, Fred owes $180,000 to the bank, and his equity is $20,000.\n2.  The value of Freda\u2019s house is $250,000. It does not matter what price she bought it for. She owes zero to the bank, so her equity is the whole $250,000.\n3.  The value of Frank\u2019s house is $160,000. He owes $60,000 to the bank (the original $80,000 minus the $20,000 he has paid off the loan). His equity is $100,000.\n{: type=\"a\" .lower-alpha}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich has a higher average return over time: stocks, bonds, or a savings account? Explain your answer.\n\n\n\nOver a sustained period of time, stocks have an average return higher than bonds, and bonds have an average return higher than a savings account. This is because in any given year the value of a savings account changes very little. In contrast, stock values can grow or decline by a very large amount (for example, the S&amp;P 500 increased 26% in 2009 after declining 37% in 2008. The value of a bond, which depends largely on interest rate fluctuations, varies far less than a stock, but more than a savings account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestors sometimes fear that a high-risk investment is especially likely to have low returns. Is this fear true? Does a high risk mean the return must be low?\n\n\n\nWhen people believe that a high-risk investment must have a low return, they are getting confused between what risk and return mean. Yes, a high-risk investment might have a low return, but it might also have a high return. Risk refers to the fact that a wide range of outcomes is possible. However, a high-risk investment must, on average, expect a relatively high return or else no one would be willing to take the risk. Thus, it is quite possible\u2014even likely\u2014for an investment to have high risk and high return. Indeed, the reason that an investment has a high expected return is that it also has a high risk.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch17mod02_rques}\n\n\n\nWhy are banks called \u201cfinancial intermediaries\u201d?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName several different kinds of bank account.

{"module_id": "m48700", "module_title": "Economics - m48700", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48700", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Explain the random walk theory\n* Calculate simple and compound interest\n* Evaluate how capital markets transform financial capital\n\n\n\nGetting rich may seem straightforward enough. Figure out what companies are going to grow and earn high profits in the future, or figure out what companies are going to become popular for everyone else to buy. Those companies are the ones that will pay high dividends or whose stock price will climb in the future. Then, buy stock in those companies. Presto! Multiply your money!\n\nWhy is this path to riches not as easy as it sounds? This module first discusses the problems with picking stocks, and then discusses a more reliable but undeniably duller method of accumulating personal wealth.\n\n### Why It Is Hard to Get Rich Quick: The Random Walk Theory   {#ch17mod03_01}\n\nThe chief problem with attempting to buy **stock**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} in companies that will have higher prices in the future is that many other financial investors are trying to do the same thing. Thus, in attempting to get rich in the stock market, it is no help to identify a company that is going to earn high profits if many other investors have already reached the same conclusion, because the stock price will already be high, based on the expected high level of future profits.\n\nThe idea that stock prices are based on expectations about the future has a powerful and unexpected implication. If expectations determine stock price, then shifts in expectations will determine shifts in the stock price. Thus, what matters for predicting whether the stock price of a company will do well is not whether the company will actually earn profits in the future. Instead, you must find a company that is widely believed at present to have poor prospects, but that will actually turn out to be a shining star. Brigades of stock market analysts and individual investors are carrying out such research 24 hours a day.\n\nThe fundamental problem with predicting future stock winners is that, by definition, no one can predict the future news that alters expectations about profits. Because stock prices will shift in response to unpredictable future news, these prices will tend to follow what mathematicians call a \u201crandom walk with a trend.\u201d The \u201crandom walk\u201d part means that, on any given day, stock prices are just as likely to rise as to fall. \u201cWith a trend\u201d means that over time, the upward steps tend to be larger than the downward steps, so stocks do gradually climb.\n\nIf stocks follow a random walk, then not even financial professionals will be able to choose those that will beat the average consistently. While some investment advisers are better than average in any given year, and some even succeed for a number of years in a row, the majority of financial investors do not outguess the market. If we look back over time, it is typically true that half or two-thirds of the mutual funds that attempted to pick stocks which would rise more than the market average actually ended up doing worse than the market average. For the average investor who reads the business pages of the newspaper over a cup of coffee in the morning, the odds of doing better than full-time professionals is not very good at all. Trying to pick the stocks that will gain a great deal in the future is a risky and unlikely way to become rich.\n\n### Getting Rich the Slow, Boring Way   {#ch17mod03_02}\n\nMany U.S. citizens can accumulate a large amount of wealth during their lifetimes, if they make two key choices. The first is to complete additional education and training. In 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau reported median earnings for households where the main earner had only a high school degree of $33,124; for those with a two-year associate degree, median earnings were $40,560 and for those with a four-year bachelor\u2019s degree, median income was $54,340. Learning is not only good for you, but it pays off financially, too.\n\nThe second key choice is to start saving money early in life, and to give the power of compound interest a chance. Imagine that at age 25, you save $3,000 and place that money into an account that you do not touch. In the long run, it is not unreasonable to assume a 7% real annual rate of return (that is, 7% above the rate of inflation) on money invested in a well-diversified stock portfolio. After 40 years, using the formula for compound interest, the original $3,000 investment will have multiplied nearly fifteen fold:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"> <mrow> <mn>3</mn><mo>,</mo><mn>000</mn><msup> <mrow> <mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>.07</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>40</mn> </mrow> </msup> <mo>=</mo><mtext>$</mtext><mn>44,923</mn> </mrow> </math>\n\n\nHaving $45,000 does not make you a millionaire. Notice, however, that this tidy sum is the result of saving $3,000 exactly once. Saving that amount every year for several decades\u2014or saving more as income rises\u2014will multiply the total considerably. This type of wealth will not rival the riches of Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, but remember that only half of Americans have any money in mutual funds at all. Accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars by retirement is a perfectly achievable goal for a well-educated person who starts saving early in life\u2014and that amount of accumulated wealth will put you at or near the top 10% of all American households. The following Work It Out feature shows the difference between simple and compound interest, and the power of compound interest.\n\n\n\nSimple and Compound Interest\n\n**Simple interest**{: data-type=\"term\"} is an interest rate calculation only on the principal amount.\n\nStep 1. Learn the formula for simple interest:\n\n\nPrincipal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time = Interest\n\nStep 2. Practice using the simple interest formula.\n\nExample 1: $100 Deposit at a simple interest rate of 5% held for one year is:\n\n\n$100 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 1 = $5\n\nSimple interest in this example is $5.\n\nExample 2: $100 Deposit at a simple interest rate of 5% held for three years is:\n\n\n$100 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 3 = $15\n\nSimple interest in this example is $5.\n\nStep 3. Calculate the total future amount using this formula:\n\n\nTotal future amount = principal + interest\n\nStep 4. Put the two simple interest formulas together.\n\n\nTotal future amount (with simple interest) = Principal + (Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time)\n\nStep 5. Apply the simple interest formula to our three year example.\n\n\nTotal future amount (with simple interest) = $100 + ($100 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 3) = $115\n\n**Compound interest**{: data-type=\"term\"} is an interest rate calculation on the principal plus the accumulated interest.\n\nStep 6. To find the compound interest, we determine the difference between the future value and the present value of the principal. This is accomplished as follows:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"block\"> <mrow> <mtext>Future\u00a0Value</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Principal\u00a0</mtext><mo>\u00d7</mo><mtext>\u00a0</mtext><msup> <mrow> <mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mtext>1 + interest\u00a0rate</mtext><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo> </mrow> <mrow> <mtext>time</mtext> </mrow> </msup> </mrow> </math>\n\n\nCompound interest = Future Value \u2013 Present Valve\n\nStep 7. Apply this formula to our three-year scenario. Follow the calculations in\n\n[\\[link\\]](#ch17mod03_tab04)\n\n<table id=\"ch17mod03_tab04\" summary=\"Table 1.4 applies the compound interest formula to a 3-year scenario in which $100 is invested in a bank account. In Year 1, the amount in the bank was $100. The bank interest rate was 5%. The total return was $105, which you get with the equation $100 + ($100 x 0.5). In Year 2, the amount in the bank was $105. The bank interest rate was 5%. The total return was $110.25, which you get with the equation $105 + ($105 x .05). In Year 3, the amount in the bank was $110.25. The bank interest rate was 5%. The total return was $115.75, which you get with the equation $110.25 + ($110.25 x .05). The total compound interest for all three years is $15.75, which you get by subtracting the initial deposit for year 1, $100, from the total return at the end of year 3, $115.75.\"><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Year 1</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amount in Bank</td>\n<td data-align=\"center\">$100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bank Interest Rate</td>\n<td data-align=\"center\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td data-align=\"center\">$105</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td />\n<td data-align=\"center\">$100 + ($100 \u00d7 0.5)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Year 2</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amount in Bank</td>\n<td data-align=\"center\">$105</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bank Interest Rate</td>\n<td data-align=\"center\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td data-align=\"center\">$110.25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td />\n<td data-align=\"center\">$105 + ($105 \u00d7 .05)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" data-align=\"center\"><strong>Year 3</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Amount in Bank</td>\n<td data-align=\"center\">$110.25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bank Interest Rate</td>\n<td data-align=\"center\">5%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total</td>\n<td data-align=\"center\">$115.75</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td />\n<td data-align=\"center\">$110.25 + ($110.25 \u00d7 .05)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Compound interest</td>\n<td data-align=\"center\">$115.75 \u2013 $100 = $15.75</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\nStep 8. Note that, after three years, the total is $115.75. Therefore the total compound interest is $15.75. This is $0.75 more than was obtained with simple interest. While this may not seem like much, keep in mind that we were only working with $100 and over a relatively short time period. Compound interest can make a huge difference with larger sums of money and over longer periods of time.\n\n\n\nGetting additional education and saving money early in life obviously will not make you rich overnight. Additional education typically means putting off earning income and living as a student for more years. Saving money often requires choices like driving an older or less expensive car, living in a smaller apartment or buying a smaller house, and making other day-to-day sacrifices. For most people, the tradeoffs for achieving substantial personal wealth will require effort, patience, and sacrifice.\n\n### How Capital Markets Transform Financial Flows   {#ch17mod03_03}\n\nFinancial capital markets have the power to repackage money as it moves from those who supply financial capital to those who demand it. Banks accept checking account deposits and turn them into long-term loans to companies. Individual firms sell shares of stock and issue bonds to raise capital. Firms make and sell an astonishing array of goods and services, but an investor can receive a return on the company\u2019s decisions by buying stock in that company. Stocks and bonds are sold and resold by financial investors to one another. Venture capitalists and angel investors search for promising small companies. Mutual funds combine the stocks and bonds\u2014and thus, indirectly, the products and investments\u2014of many different companies.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read an article about how austerity can work.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch17mod03_qr01\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nIn this chapter, we discussed the basic mechanisms of financial markets. (A more advanced course in economics or finance will consider more sophisticated tools.) The fundamentals of those financial capital markets remain the same: Firms are trying to raise financial capital and households are looking for a desirable combination of rate of return, risk, and liquidity. Financial markets are society\u2019s mechanisms for bringing together these forces of demand and supply.\n\n\n\nThe Housing Bubble and the Financial Crisis of 2007\n\nThe housing boom and bust in the United States, and the resulting multi-trillion-dollar decline in home equity, started with the fall of home prices starting in 2007. As home values fell, many home prices fell below the amount owed on the mortgage and owners stopped paying and defaulted on their loan. Banks found that their assets (loans) became worthless. Many financial institutions around the world had invested in mortgage-backed securities, or had purchased insurance on mortgage-backed securities. When housing prices collapsed, the value of those financial assets collapsed as well. The asset side of the banks\u2019 balance sheets dropped, causing bank failures and bank runs. Around the globe, financial institutions were bankrupted or nearly so. The result was a large decrease in lending and borrowing, referred to as a freezing up of available credit. When credit dries up, the economy is on its knees. The crisis was not limited to the United States. Iceland, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain, Portugal, and Greece all had similar housing boom and bust cycles, and similar credit freezes.\n\nIf businesses cannot access financial capital, they cannot make physical capital investments. Those investments ultimately lead to job creation. So when credit dried up, businesses invested less, and they ultimately laid off millions of workers. This caused incomes to drop, which caused demand to drop. In turn businesses sold less, so they laid off more workers. Compounding these events, as economic conditions worsened, financial institutions were even less likely to make loans.\n\nTo make matters even worse, as businesses sold less, their expected future profit decreased, and this led to a drop in stock prices. Combining all these effects led to major decreases in incomes, demand, consumption, and employment, and to the Great Recession, which in the United States officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. During this time, the unemployment rate rose from 5% to a peak of 10.1%. Four years after the recession officially ended, unemployment was still stubbornly high, at 7.6%, and 11.8 million people were still unemployed.\n\nAs the world\u2019s leading consumer, if the United States goes into recession, it usually drags other countries down with it. The Great Recession was no exception. With few exceptions, U.S. trading partners also entered into recessions of their own, of varying lengths, or suffered slower economic growth. Like the United States, many European countries also gave direct financial assistance, so-called bailouts, to the institutions that make up their financial markets. There was good reason to do this. Financial markets bridge the gap between demanders and suppliers of financial capital. These institutions and markets need to function in order for an economy to invest in new financial capital.\n\nHowever, much of this bailout money was borrowed, and this borrowed money contributed to another crisis in Europe. Because of the impact on their budgets of the financial crisis and the resulting bailouts, many countries found themselves with unsustainably high deficits. They chose to undertake austerity measures, large decreases in government spending and large tax increases, in order to reduce their deficits. Greece, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal have all had to undertake relatively severe austerity measures. The ramifications of this crisis have spread; the viability of the euro has even been called into question.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch17mod03_summ}\n\nIt is extremely difficult, even for financial professionals, to predict changes in future expectations and thus to choose the stocks whose price is going to rise in the future. Most Americans can accumulate considerable financial wealth if they follow two rules: complete significant additional education and training after graduating from high school and start saving money early in life.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch17mod03_sques}\n\n\n\nWhat is the total amount of interest collected from a $5,000 loan after three years with a simple interest rate of 6%?\n\n\n\nPrincipal + (principal \u00d7 rate \u00d7 time)\n\n$5,000 + ($5,000 \u00d7 0.06 \u00d7 3) = $5,900\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your receive $500 in simple interest on a loan that you made for $10,000 for 5 years, what was the interest rate you charged?\n\n\n\nPrincipal + (principal \u00d7 rate \u00d7 time); Interest = Principal \u00d7 rate \u00d7 time; $500 = $10,000 \u00d7 rate \u00d7 5 years; $500 = $50,000 \u00d7 rate; $500/$50,000 = rate; Rate = 1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou open a 5-year CD for $1,000 that pays 2% interest, compounded annually.

How does this affect economic growth and employment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou and your friend have opened an account on E-Trade and have each decided to select five similar companies in which to invest. You are diligent in monitoring your selections, tracking prices, current events, and actions taken by the company. Your friend chooses his companies randomly, pays no attention to the financial news, and spends his leisure time focused on everything besides his investments. Explain what might be the performance for each of your portfolios at the end of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do bank failures cause the economy to go into recession?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems   {#ch17mod03_prob}\n\n\n\nHow much money do you have to put into a bank account that pays 10% interest compounded annually to have $10,000 in ten years?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany retirement funds charge an administrative fee each year equal to 0.25% on managed assets. Suppose that Alexx and Spenser each invest $5,000 in the same stock this year. Alexx invests directly and earns 5% a year. Spenser uses a retirement fund and earns 4.75%. After 30 years, how much more will Alexx have than Spenser?\n\n\n\n\n### References   {#ch17mod03_ref}\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce: United States Census Bureau. \u201cIncome: Table H-13.

If they were imported, they may be subject to a tariff (a tax on imported goods) that could raise the price of your car. What do you think about that tariff? Would you write to your representative or your senator about it? Would you start a Facebook or Twitter campaign?\n\nMost people are unlikely to fight this kind of tax or even inform themselves about the issue in the first place. In *The Logic of Collective Action* (1965), economist Mancur Olson challenged the popular idea that, in a democracy, the majority view will prevail, and in doing so launched the modern study of public economy, sometimes referred to as public choice, a subtopic of microeconomics. In this chapter, we will look at the economics of government policy, why smaller, more organized groups have an incentive to work hard to get certain policies enacted, and why lawmakers ultimately make decisions that may result in bad economic policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Public Economy\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Voter Participation and Costs of Elections\n* Special Interest Politics\n* Flaws in the Democratic System of Government\n\n\n\nAs President Abraham Lincoln famously said in his 1863 *Gettysburg Address*, democratic governments are supposed to be \u201cof the people, by the people, and for the people.\u201d Can we rely on democratic governments to enact sensible economic policies? After all, they react to voters, not to analyses of demand and supply curves. The main focus of an economics course is, naturally enough, to analyze the characteristics of markets and purely economic institutions. But political institutions also play a role in allocating society\u2019s scarce resources, and economists have played an active role, along with other social scientists, in analyzing how such political institutions work.\n\nOther chapters of this book discuss situations in which market forces can sometimes lead to undesirable results: monopoly, imperfect competition, and antitrust policy; negative and positive externalities; poverty and inequality of incomes; failures to provide insurance; and financial markets that may go from boom to bust. Many of these chapters suggest that government economic policies could be aimed at addressing these issues.\n\nHowever, just as markets can face issues and problems that lead to undesirable outcomes, a democratic system of government can also make mistakes, either by enacting policies that do not benefit society as a whole or by failing to enact policies that would have benefited society as a whole. This chapter discusses some practical difficulties of democracy from an economic point of view: the actors in the political system are presumed to follow their own self-interest, which is not necessarily the same as the public good. For example, many of those who are eligible to vote do not, which obviously raises questions about whether a democratic system will reflect everyone\u2019s interests. Benefits or costs of government action are sometimes concentrated on small groups, which in some cases may organize and have a disproportionately large impact on politics and in other cases may fail to organize and end up neglected. A legislator who worries about support from voters in his or her district may focus on spending projects specific to the district without sufficient concern for whether this spending is in the interest of the nation.\n\nWhen more than two choices exist, the principle that the majority of voters should decide may not always make logical sense, because situations can arise where it becomes literally impossible to decide what the \u201cmajority\u201d prefers. Government may also be slower than private firms to correct its mistakes, because government agencies do not face competition or the threat of new entry.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

In congressional elections when there is no presidential race, or in local elections, the turnout is typically lower, often less than half the eligible voters. In other countries, the share of adults who vote is often higher. For example, in national elections since the 1980s in Germany, Spain, and France, about 75% to 80% of those of voting age cast ballots. Even this total falls well short of 100%. Some countries have laws that require voting, among them Australia, Belgium, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Singapore, and most Latin American nations. At the time the United States was founded, voting was mandatory in Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Georgia. Even if the law can require people to vote, however, no law can require that each voter cast an informed or a thoughtful vote. Moreover, in the United States and in most countries around the world, the freedom to vote has also typically meant the freedom *not* to vote.\n\nWhy do people not vote? Perhaps they do not care too much about who wins, or they are uninformed about who is running, or they do not believe their vote will matter or change their lives in any way. Indeed, these reasons are probably tied together, since people who do not believe their vote matters will not bother to become informed or care who wins. Economists have suggested why a **utility-maximizing**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} person might rationally decide not to vote or not to become informed about the election. While a few elections in very small towns may be decided by a single vote, in most elections of any size, the margin of victory is measured in hundreds, thousands, or even millions of votes. A rational voter will recognize that one vote is extremely unlikely to make a difference. This theory of **rational ignorance**{: data-type=\"term\"} holds that people will not vote if the costs of becoming informed and voting are too high, or they feel their vote will not be decisive in the election.\n\nIn a 1957 work, *An Economic Theory of Democracy*, the economist **Anthony Downs**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} stated the problem this way: \u201cIt seems probable that for a great many citizens in a democracy, rational behavior excludes any investment whatever in political information per se. No matter how significant a difference between parties is revealed to the rational citizen by his free information, or how uncertain he is about which party to support, he realizes that his vote has almost no chance of influencing the outcome\u2026 He will not even utilize all the free information available, since assimilating it takes time.\u201d In his classic 1948 novel *Walden Two*, the psychologist B. F. Skinner puts the issue even more succinctly via one of his characters, who states: \u201cThe chance that one man\u2019s vote will decide the issue in a national election\u2026is less than the chance that he will be killed on his way to the polls.\u201d The following Clear It Up feature explores another aspect of the election process: spending.\n\n\n\nHow much is too much to spend on an election?\n\nAccording to a report from *The New York Times*, the 2012 elections for president, Congress, and state and local offices, saw a total of about $5.8 billion spent. The money raised went to the campaigns, including advertising, fundraising, travel, and staff. Many people worry that politicians spend too much time raising money and end up entangled with special interest groups that make major donations. Critics would prefer a system that restricts what candidates can spend, perhaps in exchange for limited public campaign financing or free television advertising time.\n\nHow much spending on campaigns is too much? Five billion dollars will buy a lot of potato chips, but in the U.S. economy, which exceeded $16 trillion in 2012, the $5.8 billion spent on political campaigns was about 1/25 of 1% of the overall economy. Here is another way to think about campaign spending. *Total* government spending programs in 2009, including federal and state governments, was about $5.1 trillion, so the cost of choosing the people who would determine how this money would be spent was about 1/10 of 1% of that. In the context of the enormous U.S. economy, $5.8 billion is not as much money as it sounds. U.S. consumers spend about $2 billion per year on toothpaste and $7 billion on hair care products. In 2008, Proctor and Gamble spent $4.8 billion on advertising. It may not be sensible to believe the United States is going to decide its presidential elections for less than we spend on toothpaste or than Proctor and Gamble spends on advertisements.\n\nWhatever we believe about whether candidates and their parties spend too much or too little on elections, the U.S. Supreme Court has placed limits on how government can limit campaign spending. In a 1976 decision, *Buckley v. Valeo*, the Supreme Court emphasized that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution specifies freedom of speech. The federal government and states can offer candidates a voluntary deal in which government makes some public financing available to candidates, but only if the candidates agree to abide by certain spending limits. Of course, candidates can also voluntarily agree to set certain spending limits if they wish. But government cannot forbid people or organizations to raise and spend money above these limits if they choose.\n\nIn 2002, Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed into law the **Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. The relatively noncontroversial portions of the act strengthen the rules requiring full and speedy disclosure of who contributes money to campaigns. However, some controversial portions of the Act limit the ability of individuals and groups to make certain kinds of political donations and they ban certain kinds of advertising in the months leading up to an election. These bans were called into question after the release of two films: Michael Moore\u2019s *Fahrenheit 9/11* and Citizens United\u2019s *Hillary: The Movie*. At question was whether each film sought to discredit political candidates for office too close to an election, in violation of the BCRA. Moore\u2019s film was found by lower courts not to violate the Act, while Citizens United\u2019s was. The fight reached the Supreme Court, as *Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission*, saying that the First Amendment protects the rights of corporations as well as individuals to donate to political campaigns. The Court ruled, in a 5\u20134 decision, that the spending limits were unconstitutional. This controversial decision, which essentially allows unlimited contributions by corporations to political action committees, overruled several previous decisions and will likely be revisited in the future, due to the strength of the public reaction. For now, it has resulted in a sharp increase in election spending.\n\n\n\nWhile many U.S. adults do not bother to vote in presidential elections, more than half do. What motivates them? Research on voting behavior has shown that people who are more settled or more \u201cconnected\u201d to society tend to vote more frequently. According to the *Washington Post*, more married people vote than single people. Those with a job vote more than the unemployed. Those who have lived longer in a neighborhood are more likely to vote than newcomers. Those who report that they know their neighbors and talk to them are more likely to vote than socially isolated people. Those with a higher income and level of education are also more likely to vote. These factors suggest that politicians are likely to focus more on the interests of married, employed, well-educated people with at least a middle-class level of income than on the interests of other groups. For example, those who vote may tend to be more supportive of financial assistance for the two-year and four-year colleges they expect their children to attend than they are of medical care or public school education aimed at families of the poor and unemployed.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to see a breakdown of how different groups voted in 2012.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nA number of proposals have been offered to encourage greater voter turnout: making it easier to register to vote, keeping the polls open for more hours, or even moving Election Day to the weekend, when fewer people need to worry about jobs or school commitments. However, the changes that have been made do not seem to have caused a long-term upward trend in the number of people voting. After all, casting an informed vote will always impose some costs of time and energy. It is not clear how to strengthen people\u2019s feeling of connectedness to society in a way that will lead to a substantial increase in voter turnout. Without greater voter turnout, however, politicians elected by the votes of 60% or fewer of the population may not enact economic policy in the best interests of 100% of the population. Meanwhile, countering a long trend toward making voting easier, many states have recently erected new voting laws that critics say are actually barriers to voting. States have passed laws reducing early voting, restricting groups who are organizing get-out-the-vote efforts, enacted strict photo ID laws, as well as laws that require showing proof of U.S. citizenship. The ACLU argues that while these laws profess to prevent voter fraud, they are in effect making it harder for individuals to cast their vote.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe theory of rational ignorance says voters will recognize that their single vote is extremely unlikely to influence the outcome of an election. As a consequence, they will choose to remain uninformed about issues and not vote. This theory helps explain why voter turnout is so low in the United States.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nBased on the theory of rational ignorance, what should we expect to happen to voter turnout as the Internet makes information easier to obtain?\n\n\n\nAll other things being equal, voter turnout should increase as the cost of casting an informed vote decreases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the cost of voting in an election?\n\n\n\nThe cost in time of voting, transportation costs to and from the polling place, and any additional time and effort spent becoming informed about the candidates.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Question\n\n\n\nHow does rational ignorance discourage voting?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are some reasons people might find acquiring information about politics and voting rational, in contrast to rational ignorance theory?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some possible ways to encourage voter participation and overcome rational ignorance?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that rational ignorance discourages some people from becoming informed about elections, is it necessarily a good idea to encourage greater voter turnout? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nOlson, Mancur. *The Logic of Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups*, (Boston: Harvard University Press, 1965).\n\nDowns, Anthony. *An Economic Theory of Democracy*.

For example, many U.S. drivers do not much care where the tires for their car were made\u2014they just want good quality as inexpensively as they can get it. In September 2009, President Obama and Congress enacted a **tariff**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (taxes added on imported goods) on tires imported from China that would increase the import price of Chinese tires by 35 percent in its first year, 30 percent in its second year, and 25 percent in its third year. Interestingly, the U.S. companies that make tires did not favor this step, because most of them also import tires from China and other countries. (See [Globalization and Protectionism](/m48824){: .target-chapter} for more on tariffs.) However, the United Steelworkers union, which had seen jobs in the tire industry fall by 5,000 over the previous five years, lobbied fiercely for the tariff to be enacted. With this tariff, the cost of all tires increased significantly. (See the closing Bring It Home feature at the end of this chapter for more information on the tire tariff.)\n\n**Special interest groups**{: data-type=\"term\"} are groups that are small in number relative to the nation, but quite well organized and focused on a specific issue. A special interest group can pressure legislators to enact public policies that do not benefit society as a whole. Imagine an environmental rule to reduce air pollution that will cost 10 large companies $8 million each, for a total cost of $80 million. The social benefits from enacting this rule provide an average benefit of $10 for every person in the United States, for a total of about $3 trillion. Even though the benefits are far higher than the costs for society as a whole, the 10 companies are likely to lobby much more fiercely to avoid $8 million in costs than the average person is to argue for $10 worth of benefits.\n\nAs this example suggests, we can relate the problem of special interests in politics to an issue raised in [Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities](/m48668){: .target-chapter} about economic policy with respect to **negative externalities**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and pollution\u2014the problem called **regulatory capture**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (which we defined in [Monopoly and Antitrust Policy](/m48661){: .target-chapter}). In legislative bodies and agencies that write laws and regulations about how much corporations will pay in taxes, or rules for safety in the workplace, or instructions on how to satisfy environmental regulations, you can be sure the specific industry affected has **lobbyists**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} who study every word and every comma. They talk with the legislators who are writing the legislation and suggest alternative wording. They contribute to the campaigns of legislators on the key committees\u2014and may even offer those legislators high-paying jobs after they have left office. As a result, it often turns out that those who are being regulated can exercise considerable influence over the regulators.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read about lobbying.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, about 40 million people in the United States were eligible for **Medicare**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, a government program that provides health insurance for those 65 and older. On some issues, the elderly are a powerful interest group. They donate money and time to political campaigns, and in the 2012 presidential election, 70% of those over age 65 voted, while just 49% of those aged 18 to 24 cast a ballot, according to the U.S. Census.\n\nIn 2003, Congress passed and President George Bush signed into law a substantial expansion of Medicare that helped the elderly to pay for prescription drugs. The prescription drug benefit cost the federal government about $40 billion in 2006, and the Medicare system projects that the annual cost will rise to $121 billion by 2016. The political pressure to pass a prescription drug benefit for Medicare was apparently quite high, while the political pressure to assist the 40 million with no health insurance at all was considerably lower. One reason might be that senior citizens are represented by **AARP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, a well-funded and well-organized lobbying group, while there is no umbrella organization to lobby for those without health insurance.\n\nIn the battle over passage of the 2010 **Affordable Care Act (ACA)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which became known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d there was heavy lobbying on all sides by insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies. However, a lobby group, **Health Care for America Now (HCAN)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, was financed by labor unions and community groups and was organized to offset corporate lobbying. HCAN, spending $60 million dollars, was successful in helping to get the legislation passed which added new regulations on insurance companies and a mandate that all individuals will obtain health insurance by 2014. The following Work It Out feature further explains voter incentives and lobbyist influence.\n\n\n\nPaying To Get Your Way\n\nSuppose Congress proposes a tax on carbon emissions for certain factories in a small town of 10,000 people. The tax is estimated to reduce pollution to such an extent that it will benefit each resident by an equivalent of $300. The tax will also reduce profits to the town\u2019s two large factories by $1 million each. How much should the factory owners be willing to spend to fight the passage of the tax, and how much should the townspeople be willing to pay to support it? Why is society unlikely to achieve the optimal outcome?\n\nStep 1. The two factory owners each stand to lose $1 million if the tax is passed, so each should be willing to spend up to that amount to prevent the passage of the tax, a combined sum of $2 million. Of course, in the real world, there is no guarantee that lobbying efforts will be successful, so the factory owners may choose to invest an amount that is substantially lower.\n\nStep 2. There are 10,000 townspeople, each standing to benefit by $300 if the tax passes. Theoretically, then, they should be willing to spend up to $3 million (10,000 \u00d7 $300) to ensure passage. (Again, in the real world with no guarantees of success, they may choose to spend less.)\n\nStep 3. It is costly and difficult for 10,000 people to coordinate in such a way as to influence public policy. Since each person stands to gain only $300, many may feel lobbying is not worth the effort.\n\nStep 4. The two factory owners, however, find it very easy and profitable to coordinate their activities, so they have a greater incentive to do so.\n\n\n\nSpecial interests may develop a close relationship with one political party, so their ability to influence legislation rises and falls as that party moves in or out of power. A special interest may even hurt a political party if it appears to a number of voters that the relationship is too cozy. In a close election, a small group that has been under-represented in the past may find that it can tip the election one way or another\u2014so that group will suddenly receive considerable attention. Democratic institutions produce an ebb and flow of political parties and interests and thus offer both opportunities for special interests and ways of counterbalancing those interests over time.\n\n### Identifiable Winners, Anonymous Losers\n\nA number of economic policies produce gains whose beneficiaries are easily identifiable, but costs that are partly or entirely shared by a large number who remain anonymous. A democratic political system probably has a bias toward those who are identifiable.\n\nFor example, policies that impose **price controls**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\u2014like rent control\u2014may look as if they benefit renters and impose costs only on landlords. However, when landlords then decide to reduce the number of rental units available in the area, a number of people who would have liked to rent an apartment end up living somewhere else because no units were available. These would-be renters have experienced a cost of rent control, but it is hard to identify who they are.\n\nSimilarly, policies that block imports will benefit the firms that would have competed with those imports\u2014and workers at those firms\u2014who are likely to be quite visible. Consumers who would have preferred to purchase the imported products, and who thus bear some costs of the protectionist policy, are much less visible.\n\nSpecific tax breaks and spending programs also have identifiable winners and impose costs on others who are hard to identify. Special interests are more likely to arise from a group that is easily identifiable, rather than from a group where some of those who suffer may not even recognize they are bearing costs.\n\n### Pork Barrels and Logrolling\n\nPoliticians have an incentive to ensure that government money is spent in their home state or district, where it will benefit their constituents in a direct and obvious way. Thus, when legislators are negotiating over whether to support a piece of legislation, they commonly ask each other to include **pork-barrel spending**{: data-type=\"term\"}, legislation that benefits mainly a single political district. Pork-barrel spending is another case in which democracy is challenged by concentrated benefits and widely dispersed costs: the benefits of pork-barrel spending are obvious and direct to local voters, while the costs are spread over the entire country. Read the following Clear It Up feature for more information on pork-barrel spending.\n\n\n\nHow much impact can pork-barrel spending have?\n\nU.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, who was originally elected to the Senate in 1958 and served until 2010, is widely regarded as one of the masters of pork-barrel politics, directing a steady stream of federal funds to his home state. A journalist once compiled a list of structures in West Virginia at least partly funded by the government and named after Byrd: \u201cthe Robert C. Byrd Highway; the Robert C. Byrd Locks and Dam; the Robert C. Byrd Institute; the Robert C. Byrd Life Long Learning Center; the Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program; the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope; the Robert C. Byrd Institute for Advanced Flexible Manufacturing; the Robert C. Byrd Federal Courthouse; the Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center; the Robert C. Byrd Academic and Technology Center; the Robert C. Byrd United Technical Center; the Robert C. Byrd Federal Building; the Robert C. Byrd Drive; the Robert C. Byrd Hilltop Office Complex; the Robert C. Byrd Library; and the Robert C. Byrd Learning Resource Center; the Robert C. Byrd Rural Health Center.\u201d This list does not include government-funded projects in West Virginia that were not named after Byrd. Of course, we would have to analyze each of these expenditures in detail to figure out whether they should be treated as pork-barrel spending or whether they provide widespread benefits that reach beyond West Virginia. At least some of them, or a portion of them, certainly would fall into that category. Because there are currently no term limits for Congressional representatives, those who have been in office longer generally have more power to enact pork-barrel projects.\n\n\n\nThe amount spent on individual pork-barrel projects is small, but many small projects can add up to a substantial total. A nonprofit watchdog organization, called Citizens against Government Waste, produces an annual report, the *Pig Book* that attempts to quantify the amount of pork-barrel spending, focusing on items that were requested by only one member of Congress, that were passed into law without any public hearings, or that serve only a local purpose. Whether any specific item qualifies as pork can be controversial, of course, but at least by this measure, pork-barrel spending totaled $2.7 billion in 2014.\n\nPork-barrel spending can be encouraged by **logrolling**{: data-type=\"term\"}, an action in which all members of a group of legislators agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated laws that they individually favor. For example, if one member of the U.S. Congress suggests building a new bridge or hospital in his or her own congressional district, the other members might oppose it. However, if 51% of the legislators come together, they can pass a bill that includes a bridge or hospital for every one of their districts.\n\nAs a reflection of this interest of legislators in their own districts, the U.S. government has typically spread out its spending on military bases and weapons programs to congressional districts all across the country. In part, this is done to help create a situation that encourages members of Congress to vote in support of defense spending.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nSpecial interest politics arises when a relatively small group, called a special interest group, each of whose members has a large interest in a political outcome, devotes a lot of time and energy to lobbying for the group\u2019s preferred choice. Meanwhile, the large majority, each of whose members has only a small interest in this issue, pays no attention.\n\nPork-barrel spending is defined as legislation whose benefits are concentrated on a single district while the costs are spread widely over the country. Logrolling refers to a situation in which two or more legislators agree to vote for each other\u2019s legislation, which can then encourage pork-barrel spending in many districts.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the main factor preventing a large community from influencing policy in the same way as a special interest group?\n\n\n\nThe costs of organization and the small benefit to the individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might legislators vote to impose a tariff on Egyptian cotton, when consumers in their districts would benefit from its availability?\n\n\n\nDomestic cotton producers would lobby heavily to protect themselves from the competition, whereas the consumers have little incentive to organize.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nHow can a small special interest group win in a situation of majority voting when the benefits it seeks flow only to a small group?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can pork-barrel spending occur in a situation of majority voting when it benefits only a small group?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do legislators vote for spending projects in districts that are not their own?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhen Microsoft was founded, the company devoted very few resources to lobbying activities. After a high-profile antitrust case against it, however, the company began to lobby heavily. Why does it make financial sense for companies to invest in lobbyists?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial interest groups are often made up of representatives of competing firms. Why are competitors sometimes willing to cooperate in order to form lobbying associations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial interests do not oppose regulations in all cases. The Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013 would require online merchants to collect sales taxes from their customers in other states. Why might a large online retailer like Amazon.com support such a measure?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure safety and efficacy, the Food and Drug Administration regulates the medicines that are allowed to be sold in the United States. Sometimes this means a drug must be tested for years before it is allowed to reach the market. The winners in this system are easily identifiable as those who are protected from unsafe drugs that might otherwise harm them. Who are the more anonymous losers who suffer from strict medical regulations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is it possible to bear a cost without realizing it? What are some examples of policies that affect people in ways they may not even be aware of?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs pork-barrel spending always a bad thing? Can you think of some examples of pork-barrel projects, perhaps from your own district, that have had positive results?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nSay that the government is considering a ban on smoking in restaurants in Tobaccoville. There are 1 million people living there, and each would benefit by $200 from this smoking ban. However, there are two large tobacco companies in Tobaccoville and the ban would cost them $5 million each. What are the total costs and benefits of this proposed policy? Do you think it will be passed?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nRoper Center Public Opinion Archives. \u201cA Brief History of Public Opinion on the Government\u2019s Role in Providing Health Care.\u201d Last modified September 23, 2013.\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce: United States Census Bureau. \u201cVoting and Registration: Historical Time Series Tables; Table A-10: Reported Registration Rates in Presidential Election Years, by Selected Characteristics: November 1968 to 2012.\u201d http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/socdemo/voting/publications/historical/index.html\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nlogrolling\n: the situation in which groups of legislators all agree to vote for a package of otherwise unrelated laws that they individually favor\n^\n\npork-barrel spending\n: spending that benefits mainly a single political district\n^\n\nspecial interest groups\n: groups that are small in number relative to the nation, but well organized and thus exert a disproportionate effect on political outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/lobbying", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

The advantage of democracy over other systems is that it allows everyone in a society an equal say and therefore may reduce the possibility of oppression of the masses by a small group of wealthy oligarchs. There is no such thing as a perfect system, and democracy, for all its popularity, is not without its problems, a few of which we will examine here.\n\n**Democracy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is sometimes summed up (and oversimplified) in two words: \u201cMajority rule.\u201d When voters face three or more choices, however, then voting may not always be a useful way of determining what the majority prefers.\n\nAs one example, consider an election in a state where 60% of the population is liberal and 40% is conservative. If there are only two candidates, one from each side, and if liberals and conservatives vote in the same 60\u201340 proportions in which they are represented in the population, then the liberal will win. What if the election ends up including two liberal candidates and one conservative? It is possible that the liberal vote will split and victory will go to the minority party. In this case, the outcome does not reflect the majority\u2019s preference.\n\nDoes the majority view prevail in the case of sugar **quotas**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}? Clearly there are more sugar consumers in the United States than sugar producers, but the U.S. domestic sugar lobby (www.sugarcane.org) has successfully argued for protection against imports since 1789. By law, therefore, U.S. makers of cookies and candies must use 85% domestic sugar in their products. Meanwhile quotas on imported sugar restrict supply and keep the domestic price of sugar up\u2014raising prices for companies that use sugar in the production of their goods and for consumers. The European Union allows sugar imports, and prices there are 40% lower than U.S. sugar prices. Sugar-producing countries in the Caribbean repeatedly protest the U.S. quotas at the World Trade Organization meetings, but each bite of cookie, at present, costs you more than if there were no sugar lobby. This case goes against the theory of the \u201cmedian\u201d voter in a democracy. The **median voter theory**{: data-type=\"term\"} argues that politicians will try to match policies to what pleases the median voter preferences. If we think of political positions along a spectrum from left to right, the median voter is in the middle of the spectrum. This theory argues that actual policy will reflect \u201cmiddle of the road.\u201d In the case of sugar lobby politics, the *minority*, not the median, dominates policy.\n\nSometimes it is not even clear how to define what the majority opinion might be. Step aside from politics for a moment and think about a choice facing three families (the Ortegas, the Schmidts, and the Alexanders) who are planning to celebrate New Year\u2019s Day together. They agree to vote on the menu, choosing from three entrees, and they agree that the majority vote wins. With three families, it seems reasonable that one choice of entree will get a 2\u20131 majority. What if, however, their vote ends up looking like [\\[link\\]](#Table_18_01)?\n\nClearly, the three families disagree on their first choice. But the problem goes even deeper. Instead of looking at all three choices at once, compare them two at a time. (See [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C18_001)) In a vote of turkey versus beef, turkey wins by 2\u20131. In a vote of beef versus lasagna, beef wins 2\u20131. If turkey beats beef, and beef beats lasagna, then it might seem only logical that turkey must also beat lasagna. However, with the preferences shown, lasagna is preferred to turkey by a 2\u20131 vote, as well. If lasagna is preferred to turkey, and turkey beats beef, then surely it must be that lasagna also beats beef? Actually, no; beef beats lasagna. In other words, the majority view may not win. Clearly, as any car salesmen will tell you, choices are influenced by the way they are presented.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C18_001 data-title=\"A Voting Cycle \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_18_01\" summary=\"The table shows the ranked meal preferences of the Ortega Family, the Schmidt Family, and the Alexander Family.

It is easy to imagine sets of government choices\u2014say, perhaps the choice between increased defense spending, increased government spending on health care, and a tax cut\u2014in which a voting cycle could occur. The result will be determined by the order in which choices are presented and voted on, not by majority rule, because every choice is both preferred to some alternative and also not preferred to another alternative.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read about instant runoff voting, a preferential voting system.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Where Is Government\u2019s Self-Correcting Mechanism?\n\nWhen a **firm**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} produces a product no one wants to buy or produces at a higher cost than its competitors, the firm is likely to suffer losses. If it cannot change its ways, it will go out of business. This self-correcting mechanism in the marketplace can have harsh effects on workers or on local economies, but it also puts pressure on firms for good performance.\n\nGovernment agencies, on the other hand, do not sell their products in a market; they receive tax dollars instead. They are not challenged by competitors as are private-sector firms. If the U.S. Department of Education or the U.S. Department of Defense is doing a poor job, citizens cannot purchase their services from another provider and drive the existing government agencies into bankruptcy. If you are upset that the Internal Revenue Service is slow in sending you a tax refund or seems unable to answer your questions, you cannot decide to pay your income taxes through a different organization. Of course, elected politicians can assign new leaders to government agencies and instruct them to reorganize or to emphasize a different mission. The pressure government faces, however, to change its bureaucracy, to seek greater efficiency, and to improve customer responsiveness is much milder than the threat of being put out of business altogether.\n\nThis insight suggests that when government provides goods or services directly, we might expect it to do so with less efficiency than private firms\u2014except in certain cases where the government agency may compete directly with private firms. At the local level, for example, services like garbage collection can be provided by government directly, by private firms under contract to the government, or by a mix of government employees competing with private firms.\n\n### A Balanced View of Markets and Government\n\nThe British statesman Sir Winston Churchill (1874\u20131965) once wrote: \u201cNo one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all of the other forms which have been tried from time to time.\u201d In that spirit, the theme of this discussion is certainly not that democratic government should be abandoned. A practical student of public policy needs to recognize that in some cases, like the case of well-organized special interests or pork-barrel legislation, a democratic government may seek to enact economically unwise projects or programs. In other cases, by placing a low priority on the problems of those who are not well organized or who are less likely to vote, the government may fail to act when it could do some good. In these and other cases, there is no automatic reason to believe that government will necessarily make economically sensible choices.\n\n\u201cThe true test of a first-rate mind is the ability to hold two contradictory ideas at the same time,\u201d wrote the American author F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896\u20131940). At this point in your study of microeconomics, you should be able to go one better than Fitzgerald and hold three somewhat contradictory ideas about the interrelationship between markets and government in your mind at the same time.\n\nFirst, markets are extraordinarily useful and flexible institutions through which society can allocate its scarce resources. This idea was introduced with the subjects of international trade and demand and supply in other chapters and reinforced in all the subsequent discussions of how households and firms make decisions.\n\nSecond, markets may sometimes produce unwanted results. A short list of the cases in which markets produce unwanted results includes monopoly and other cases of imperfect competition, pollution, poverty and inequality of incomes, discrimination, and failure to provide insurance.\n\nThird, while government may play a useful role in addressing the problems of markets, government action is also imperfect and may not reflect majority views. Economists readily admit that, in settings like monopoly or negative externalities, a potential role exists for government intervention. However, in the real world, it is not enough to point out that government action might be a good idea. Instead, we must have some confidence that the government is likely to identify and carry out the appropriate public policy. To make sensible judgments about economic policy, we must see the strengths and weaknesses of both markets and government. We must not idealize or demonize either unregulated markets or government actions. Instead, consider the actual strengths and weaknesses of real-world markets and real-world governments.\n\nThese three insights seldom lead to simple or obvious political conclusions. As the famous British economist **Joan Robinson**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} wrote some decades ago: \u201c\\[E\\]conomic theory, in itself, preaches no doctrines and cannot establish any universally valid laws. It is a method of ordering ideas and formulating questions.\u201d The study of economics is neither politically conservative, nor moderate, nor liberal. There are economists who are Democrats, Republicans, libertarians, socialists, and members of every other political group you can name. Of course, conservatives may tend to emphasize the virtues of markets and the limitations of government, while liberals may tend to emphasize the shortcomings of markets and the need for government programs. Such differences only illustrate that the language and terminology of economics is not limited to one set of political beliefs, but can be used by all.\n\n\n\nChinese Tire Tariffs\n\nIn April 2009, the union representing U.S. tire manufacturing workers filed a request with the U.S. **International Trade Commission (ITC)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, asking it to investigate tire imports from China. Under U.S. trade law, if imports from a country increase to the point that they cause market disruption in the United States, as determined by the ITC, then it can also recommend a remedy for this market disruption. In this case, the ITC determined that from 2004 to 2008, U.S. tire manufacturers suffered declines in production, financial health, and employment as a direct result of increases in tire imports from China. The ITC recommended that an additional tax be placed on tire imports from China. President Obama and Congress agreed with the ITC recommendation, and in June 2009 tariffs on Chinese tires increased from 4% to 39%.\n\nWhy would U.S. consumers buy imported tires from China in the first place? Most likely, because they are cheaper than tires produced domestically or in other countries. Therefore, this tariff increase should cause U.S. consumers to pay higher prices for tires, either because Chinese tires are now more expensive, or because U.S. consumers are pushed by the tariff to buy more expensive tires made by U.S. manufacturers or those from other countries. In the end, this tariff made U.S. consumers pay more for tires.\n\nWas this tariff met with outrage expressed via social media, traditional media, or mass protests? Were there \u201cOccupy Wall Street-type\u201d demonstrations? The answer is a resounding \u201cNo.\u201d Most U.S. tire consumers were likely unaware of the tariff increase, although they may have noticed the price increase, which was between $4 and $13 depending on the type of tire. Tire consumers are also potential voters. Conceivably, a tax increase, even a small one, might make voters unhappy. However, voters probably realized that it was not worth their time to learn anything about this issue or cast a vote based on it. They probably thought their vote would not matter in determining the outcome of an election or changing this policy.\n\nEstimates of the impact of this tariff show it costs U.S. consumers around $1.11 billion annually. Of this amount, roughly $817 million ends up in the pockets of foreign tire manufacturers other than in China, and the remaining $294 million goes to U.S. tire manufacturers. In other words, the tariff increase on Chinese tires may have saved 1,200 jobs in the domestic tire sector, but it cost 3,700 jobs in other sectors, as consumers had to cut down on their spending because they were paying more for tires. Jobs were actually lost as a result of this tariff. Workers in U.S. tire manufacturing firms earned about $40,000 in 2010. Given the number of jobs saved and the total cost to U.S. consumers, the cost of saving one job amounted to $926,500!\n\nThis tariff caused a net decline in U.S. social surplus. (Total surplus is discussed in the [Demand and Supply](/m48628) chapter, and tariffs are discussed in the [The International Trade and Capital Flows](/m48731) chapter.) Instead of saving jobs, it cost jobs, and those jobs that it saved cost many times more than the people working in them could ever hope to earn. Why would the government do this?\n\nThe chapter answers this question by discussing the influence special interest groups have on economic policy. The steelworkers union, whose members make tires, saw more and more of its members lose their jobs as U.S. consumers consumed more and more cheap Chinese tires. By definition, this union is relatively small but well organized, especially compared to tire consumers. It stands to gain much for each of its members, compared to what each tire consumer may have to give up in terms of higher prices. So the steelworkers union (joined by domestic tire manufacturers) has not only the means but the incentive to lobby economic policymakers and lawmakers. Given that U.S. tire consumers are a large and unorganized group, if they even are a group, it is unlikely they will lobby against higher tire tariffs. In the end, lawmakers tend to listen to those who lobby them, even though the results make for bad economic policy.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nMajority votes can run into difficulties when more than two choices exist. A voting cycle occurs when, in a situation with at least three choices, choice A is preferred by a majority vote to choice B, choice B is preferred by a majority vote to choice C, and choice C is preferred by a majority vote to choice A. In such a situation, it is impossible to identify what the majority prefers. Another difficulty arises when the vote is so divided that no choice receives a majority.\n\nA practical approach to microeconomic policy will need to take a realistic view of the specific strengths and weaknesses of markets and the specific strengths and weaknesses of government, rather than making the easy but wrong assumption that either the market or government is always beneficial or always harmful.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nTrue or false: Majority rule can fail to produce a single preferred outcome when there are more than two choices.\n\n\n\nTrue. This is exactly what occurs in a voting cycle. That is, the majority can prefer policy A to policy B, policy B to policy C, but also prefer policy C to policy A. Then, the majority will never reach a conclusive outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnastasia, Emma, and Greta are deciding what to do on a weekend getaway. They each suggest a first, second, and third choice and then vote on the options. Their first choice, second choice, and third choice preferences are as shown in [[link]](#Table_18_02). Explain why they will have a hard time reaching a decision. Does the group prefer mountain biking to canoeing? What about canoeing compared to the beach? What about the beach compared to the original choice of mountain biking?\n\n<table id=\"Table_18_02\" summary=\"The table shows the ranked activity preferences of the Anastasia, Emma, and Greta.

The group will vote for mountain biking over canoeing by 2\u20131. It will vote for canoeing over the beach by 2\u20131. If mountain biking is preferred to canoeing and canoeing is preferred to the beach, it might seem that it must be true that mountain biking is the favorite. But in a vote of the beach versus mountain biking, the beach wins by a 2\u20131 vote. When a voting cycle occurs, choosing a single favorite that is always preferred by a majority becomes impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose an election is being held for Soft Drink Commissioner. The field consists of one candidate from the Pepsi party and four from the Coca-Cola party. This would seem to indicate a strong preference for Coca-Cola among the voting population, but the Pepsi candidate ends up winning in a landslide. Why does this happen?\n\n\n\nThe four Coca-Cola candidates compete with each other for Coca-Cola voters, whereas everyone who prefers Pepsi had only one candidate to vote for. Thus the will of the majority is not satisfied.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhy does a voting cycle make it impossible to decide on a majority-approved choice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does a government agency raise revenue differently from a private company, and how does that affect the way government decisions are made, compared to business decisions?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nThe United States currently uses a voting system called \u201cfirst past the post\u201d in elections, meaning that the candidate with the most votes wins. What are some of the problems with a \u201cfirst past the post\u201d system?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some alternatives to a \u201cfirst past the post\u201d system that might reduce the problem of voting cycles?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAT&amp;T spent some $10 million dollars lobbying Congress to block entry of competitors into the telephone market in 1978. Why do you think it efforts failed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOccupy Wall Street was a national (and later global) organized protest against the greed, bank profits, and financial corruption that led to the 2008\u20132009 recession. The group popularized slogans like \u201cWe are the 99%,\u201d meaning it represented the majority against the wealth of the top 1%. Does the fact that the protests had little to no effect on legislative changes support or contradict the chapter?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nNixon, Ron. \u201cAmerican Candy Makers.

How Does One Tell?\n\nThe 1990s were boom years for the U.S. economy. The late 2000s, from 2007 to 2014 were not. What causes the economy to expand or contract? Why do businesses fail when they are making all the right decisions? Why do workers lose their jobs when they are hardworking and productive? Are bad economic times a failure of the market system? Are they a failure of the government? These are all questions of macroeconomics, which we will begin to address in this chapter. We will not be able to answer all of these questions here, but we will start with the basics: How is the economy doing? How can we tell?\n\nThe macro economy includes all buying and selling, all production and consumption; everything that goes on in every market in the economy. How can we get a handle on that? The answer begins more than 80 years ago, during the Great Depression. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his economic advisers knew things were bad\u2014but how could they express and measure just how bad it was? An economist named Simon Kuznets, who later won the Nobel Prize for his work, came up with a way to track what the entire economy is producing. The result\u2014gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014remains our basic measure of macroeconomic activity. In this chapter, you will learn how GDP is constructed, how it is used, and why it is so important.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to the Macroeconomic Perspective\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product\n* Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values\n* Tracking Real GDP over Time\n* Comparing GDP among Countries\n* How Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society\n\n\n\nMacroeconomics focuses on the economy as a whole (or on whole economies as they interact). What causes recessions? What makes unemployment stay high when recessions are supposed to be over? Why do some countries grow faster than others? Why do some countries have higher standards of living than others? These are all questions that macroeconomics addresses. Macroeconomics involves adding up the economic activity of all households and all businesses in all markets to get the overall demand and supply in the economy. However, when we do that, something curious happens. It is not unusual that what results at the macro level is different from the sum of the microeconomic parts. Indeed, what seems sensible from a microeconomic point of view can have unexpected or counterproductive results at the macroeconomic level. Imagine that you are sitting at an event with a large audience, like a live concert or a basketball game. A few people decide that they want a better view, and so they stand up. However, when these people stand up, they block the view for other people, and the others need to stand up as well if they wish to see. Eventually, nearly everyone is standing up, and as a result, no one can see much better than before. The rational decision of some individuals at the micro level\u2014to stand up for a better view\u2014ended up being self-defeating at the macro level. This is not macroeconomics, but it is an apt analogy.\n\nMacroeconomics is a rather massive subject. How are we going to tackle it? [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C19_001) illustrates the structure we will use. We will study macroeconomics from three different perspectives:\n\n1.  What are the macroeconomic goals? (Macroeconomics as a discipline does not have goals, but we do have goals for the macro economy.)\n2.  What are the frameworks economists can use to analyze the macroeconomy?\n3.  Finally, what are the policy tools governments can use to manage the macroeconomy?\n{: type=\"1\"}\n\n , and the box on the right indicates the two tools the federal government uses to influence the macro economy.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C19_001 data-title=\"Macroeconomic Goals, Framework, and Policies \"}\n\n### Goals\n\nIn thinking about the overall health of the macroeconomy, it is useful to consider three primary goals: economic growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.\n\n* Economic growth ultimately determines the prevailing standard of living in a country. Economic growth is measured by the percentage change in real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product. A growth rate of more than 3% is considered good.\n* Unemployment, as measured by the unemployment rate, is the percentage of people in the labor force who do not have a job. When people lack jobs, the economy is wasting a precious resource-labor, and the result is lower goods and services produced. Unemployment, however, is more than a statistic\u2014it represents people\u2019s livelihoods. While measured unemployment is unlikely to ever be zero, a measured unemployment rate of 5% or less is considered low (good).\n* Inflation is a sustained increase in the overall level of prices, and is measured by the consumer price index. If many people face a situation where the prices that they pay for food, shelter, and healthcare are rising much faster than the wages they receive for their labor, there will be widespread unhappiness as their standard of living declines. For that reason, low inflation\u2014an inflation rate of 1\u20132%\u2014is a major goal.\n{: data-bullet-style=\"bullet\"}\n\n### Frameworks\n\nAs you learn in the micro part of this book, principal tools used by economists are theories and models (see [Welcome to Economics!](/m48590){: .target-chapter} for more on this). In microeconomics, we used the theories of supply and demand; in macroeconomics, we use the theories of **aggregate demand (AD)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **aggregate supply (AS)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. This book presents two perspectives on macroeconomics: the Neoclassical perspective and the Keynesian perspective, each of which has its own version of AD and AS. Between the two perspectives, you will obtain a good understanding of what drives the macroeconomy.\n\n### Policy Tools\n\nNational governments have two tools for influencing the macroeconomy. The first is monetary policy, which involves managing the money supply and interest rates. The second is fiscal policy, which involves changes in government spending/purchases and taxes.\n\nEach of the items in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C19_001) will be explained in detail in one or more other chapters. As you learn these things, you will discover that the goals and the policy tools are in the news almost every day.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

The size of a nation\u2019s overall economy is typically measured by its **gross domestic product (GDP)**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year. The measurement of GDP involves counting up the production of millions of different goods and services\u2014smart phones, cars, music downloads, computers, steel, bananas, college educations, and all other new goods and services produced in the current year\u2014and summing them into a total dollar value. This task is straightforward: take the quantity of everything produced, multiply it by the price at which each product sold, and add up the total. In 2014, the U.S. GDP totaled $17.4 trillion, the largest GDP in the world.\n\nEach of the market transactions that enter into GDP must involve both a buyer and a seller. The GDP of an economy can be measured either by the total dollar value of what is purchased in the economy, or by the total dollar value of what is produced. There is even a third way, as we will explain later.\n\n### GDP Measured by Components of Demand\n\nWho buys all of this production? This **demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} can be divided into four main parts: consumer spending (consumption), business spending (investment), government spending on goods and services, and spending on net exports. (See the following Clear It Up feature to understand what is meant by investment.) [\\[link\\]](#Table_19_01) shows how these four components added up to the GDP in 2014. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C19_007) (a) shows the levels of consumption, investment, and government purchases over time, expressed as a percentage of GDP, while [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C19_007) (b) shows the levels of exports and imports as a percentage of GDP over time. A few patterns about each of these components are worth noticing. [\\[link\\]](#Table_19_01) shows the components of GDP from the demand side.

In calculating GDP, investment does not refer to the purchase of stocks and bonds or the trading of financial assets. It refers to the purchase of new capital goods, that is, new commercial real estate (such as buildings, factories, and stores) and equipment, residential housing construction, and inventories. Inventories that are produced this year are included in this year\u2019s GDP\u2014even if they have not yet sold. From the accountant\u2019s perspective, it is as if the firm invested in its own inventories. Business investment in 2014 was almost $3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n\n\n  Consumption is about two-thirds of GDP, but it moves relatively little over time. Business investment hovers around 15% of GDP, but it increases and declines more than consumption. Government spending on goods and services is around 20% of GDP. (b) Exports are added to total demand for goods and services, while imports are subtracted from total demand. If exports exceed imports, as in most of the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. economy, a trade surplus exists. If imports exceed exports, as in recent years, then a trade deficit exists. (Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm)\"){: #CNX_Econ_C19_007 data-title=\"Components of GDP on the Demand Side \"}\n\nConsumption expenditure by households is the largest component of GDP, accounting for about two-thirds of the GDP in any year. This tells us that consumers\u2019 spending decisions are a major driver of the economy. However, consumer spending is a gentle elephant: when viewed over time, it does not jump around too much.\n\n**Investment expenditure**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} refers to purchases of physical plant and equipment, primarily by businesses. If Starbucks builds a new store, or Amazon buys robots, these expenditures are counted under business investment. **Investment demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is far smaller than **consumption demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, typically accounting for only about 15\u201318% of GDP, but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created. However, it fluctuates more noticeably than consumption. Business investment is volatile; new technology or a new product can spur business investment, but then confidence can drop and business investment can pull back sharply.\n\nIf you have noticed any of the infrastructure projects (new bridges, highways, airports) launched during the recession of 2009, you have seen how important government spending can be for the economy. Government expenditure in the United States is about 20% of GDP, and includes spending by all three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The only part of government spending counted in demand is government purchases of goods or services produced in the economy. Examples include the government buying a new fighter jet for the Air Force (federal government spending), building a new highway (state government spending), or a new school (local government spending). A significant portion of government budgets are transfer payments, like unemployment benefits, veteran\u2019s benefits, and Social Security payments to retirees. These payments are excluded from GDP because the government does not receive a new good or service in return or exchange. Instead they are transfers of income from taxpayers to others. If you are curious about the awesome undertaking of adding up GDP, read the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\nHow do statisticians measure GDP?\n\nGovernment economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), within the U.S. Department of Commerce, piece together estimates of GDP from a variety of sources.\n\nOnce every five years, in the second and seventh year of each decade, the Bureau of the Census carries out a detailed census of businesses throughout the United States. In between, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of retail sales. These figures are adjusted with foreign trade data to account for exports that are produced in the United States and sold abroad and for imports that are produced abroad and sold here. Once every ten years, the Census Bureau conducts a comprehensive survey of housing and residential finance. Together, these sources provide the main basis for figuring out what is produced for consumers.\n\nFor investment, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of construction and an annual survey of expenditures on physical capital equipment.\n\nFor what is purchased by the federal government, the statisticians rely on the U.S. Department of the Treasury. An annual Census of Governments gathers information on state and local governments. Because a lot of government spending at all levels involves hiring people to provide services, a large portion of government spending is also tracked through payroll records collected by state governments and by the Social Security Administration.\n\nWith regard to foreign trade, the Census Bureau compiles a monthly record of all import and export documents. Additional surveys cover transportation and travel, and adjustment is made for financial services that are produced in the United States for foreign customers.\n\nMany other sources contribute to the estimates of GDP. Information on energy comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation and Department of Energy. Information on healthcare is collected by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality. Surveys of landlords find out about rental income. The Department of Agriculture collects statistics on farming.\n\nAll of these bits and pieces of information arrive in different forms, at different time intervals. The BEA melds them together to produce estimates of GDP on a quarterly basis (every three months). These numbers are then \u201cannualized\u201d by multiplying by four. As more information comes in, these estimates are updated and revised. The \u201cadvance\u201d estimate of GDP for a certain quarter is released one month after a quarter. The \u201cpreliminary\u201d estimate comes out one month after that. The \u201cfinal\u201d estimate is published one month later, but it is not actually final. In July, roughly updated estimates for the previous calendar year are released. Then, once every five years, after the results of the latest detailed five-year business census have been processed, the BEA revises all of the past estimates of GDP according to the newest methods and data, going all the way back to 1929.\n\n\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read FAQs on the BEA site.

By the same token, we must also subtract spending on imports\u2014goods produced in other countries that are purchased by residents of this country. The net export component of GDP is equal to the dollar value of exports (X) minus the dollar value of imports (M), (X \u2013 M). The gap between exports and imports is called the **trade balance**{: data-type=\"term\"}. If a country\u2019s exports are larger than its imports, then a country is said to have a **trade surplus**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In the United States, exports typically exceeded imports in the 1960s and 1970s, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C19_007) (b).\n\nSince the early 1980s, imports have typically exceeded exports, and so the United States has experienced a **trade deficit**{: data-type=\"term\"} in most years. Indeed, the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C19_007) (b) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades, even after the declines during the **Great Recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} between 2008 and 2009. As noted before, if exports and imports are equal, foreign trade has no effect on total GDP. However, even if exports and imports are balanced overall, foreign trade might still have powerful effects on particular industries and workers by causing nations to shift workers and physical capital investment toward one industry rather than another.\n\nBased on these four components of demand, GDP can be measured as:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>GDP</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Consumption\u00a0+\u00a0Investment\u00a0+\u00a0Government\u00a0+\u00a0Trade\u00a0balance</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>GDP</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>C\u00a0+\u00a0I\u00a0+\u00a0G\u00a0+\u00a0(X\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M)</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nUnderstanding how to measure GDP is important for analyzing connections in the macro economy and for thinking about macroeconomic policy tools.\n\n### GDP Measured by What is Produced\n\nEverything that is purchased must be produced first. [\\[link\\]](#Table_19_02) breaks down what is produced into five categories: **durable goods**{: data-type=\"term\"}, **nondurable goods**{: data-type=\"term\"}, **services**{: data-type=\"term\"}, **structures**{: data-type=\"term\"}, and the change in **inventories**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Before going into detail about these categories, notice that total GDP measured according to what is produced is exactly the same as the GDP measured by looking at the five components of demand.

[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C19_004) shows these components of what is produced, expressed as a percentage of GDP, since 1960.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C19_004 data-title=\"Types of Production \"}\n\nIn thinking about what is produced in the economy, many non-economists immediately focus on solid, long-lasting goods, like cars and computers. By far the largest part of GDP, however, is services. Moreover, services have been a growing share of GDP over time. A detailed breakdown of the leading service industries would include healthcare, education, and legal and financial services. It has been decades since most of the U.S. economy involved making solid objects. Instead, the most common jobs in a modern economy involve a worker looking at pieces of paper or a computer screen; meeting with co-workers, customers, or suppliers; or making phone calls.\n\nEven within the overall category of goods, long-lasting durable goods like cars and refrigerators are about the same share of the economy as short-lived nondurable goods like food and clothing. The category of structures includes everything from homes, to office buildings, shopping malls, and factories. Inventories is a small category that refers to the goods that have been produced by one business but have not yet been sold to consumers, and are still sitting in warehouses and on shelves. The amount of inventories sitting on shelves tends to decline if business is better than expected, or to rise if business is worse than expected.\n\n### The Problem of Double Counting\n\nGDP is defined as the current value of all final goods and services produced in a nation in a year. What are final goods? They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year. Statisticians who calculate GDP must avoid the mistake of **double counting**{: data-type=\"term\"}, in which output is counted more than once as it travels through the stages of production. For example, imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the value of tires produced by a tire manufacturer, and then counted the value of a new truck sold by an automaker that contains those tires. In this example, the value of the tires would have been counted twice-because the price of the truck includes the value of the tires.\n\nTo avoid this problem, which would overstate the size of the economy considerably, government statisticians count just the value of **final goods and services**{: data-type=\"term\"} in the chain of production that are sold for consumption, investment, government, and trade purposes. **Intermediate goods**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which are goods that go into the production of other goods, are excluded from GDP calculations. From the example above, only the value of the Ford truck will be counted. The value of what businesses provide to other businesses is captured in the final products at the end of the production chain.\n\nThe concept of GDP is fairly straightforward: it is just the dollar value of all final goods and services produced in the economy in a year. In our decentralized, market-oriented economy, actually calculating the more than $16 trillion-dollar U.S. GDP\u2014along with how it is changing every few months\u2014is a full-time job for a brigade of government statisticians.\n\n<table id=\"Table_19_03\" summary=\"The table shows what is included in a measure of GDP and what is not.

The sales of used goods are not included because they were produced in a previous year and are part of that year\u2019s GDP. The entire underground economy of services paid \u201cunder the table\u201d and illegal sales should be counted, but is not, because it is impossible to track these sales. In a recent study by Friedrich Schneider of shadow economies, the underground economy in the United States was estimated to be 6.6% of GDP, or close to $2 trillion dollars in 2013 alone. Transfer payments, such as payment by the government to individuals, are not included, because they do not represent production. Also, production of some goods\u2014such as home production as when you make your breakfast\u2014is not counted because these goods are not sold in the marketplace.\n\n\nVisit this [website][2] to read about the \u201cNew Underground Economy.\u201d\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Other Ways to Measure the Economy\n\nBesides GDP, there are several different but closely related ways of measuring the size of the economy. We mentioned above that GDP can be thought of as total production and as total purchases. It can also be thought of as total income since anything produced and sold produces income.\n\nOne of the closest cousins of GDP is the **gross national product (GNP)**{: data-type=\"term\"}. GDP includes only what is produced within a country\u2019s borders. GNP adds what is produced by domestic businesses and labor abroad, and subtracts out any payments sent home to other countries by foreign labor and businesses located in the United States. In other words, GNP is based more on the production of citizens and firms of a country, wherever they are located, and GDP is based on what happens within the geographic boundaries of a certain country. For the United States, the gap between GDP and GNP is relatively small; in recent years, only about 0.2%. For small nations, which may have a substantial share of their population working abroad and sending money back home, the difference can be substantial.\n\n**Net national product (NNP)**{: data-type=\"term\"} is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out, or reduced in value because of aging, over the course of a year. The process by which capital ages and loses value is called **depreciation**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The NNP can be further subdivided into **national income**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which includes all income to businesses and individuals, and personal income, which includes only income to people.\n\nFor practical purposes, it is not vital to memorize these definitions. However, it is important to be aware that these differences exist and to know what statistic you are looking at, so that you do not accidentally compare, say, GDP in one year or for one country with GNP or NNP in another year or another country. To get an idea of how these calculations work, follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature.\n\n\n\nCalculating GDP, Net Exports, and NNP\n\nBased on the information in [\\[link\\]](#Table_19_04)\\:\n\n1.

GDP is measured by taking the quantities of all goods and services produced, multiplying them by their prices, and summing the total. Since GDP measures what is bought and sold in the economy, it can be measured either by the sum of what is purchased in the economy or what is produced.\n\nDemand can be divided into consumption, investment, government, exports, and imports. What is produced in the economy can be divided into durable goods, nondurable goods, services, structures, and inventories. To avoid double counting, GDP counts only final output of goods and services, not the production of intermediate goods or the value of labor in the chain of production.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nCountry A has export sales of $20 billion, government purchases of $1,000 billion, business investment is $50 billion, imports are $40 billion, and consumption spending is $2,000 billion. What is the dollar value of GDP?\n\n\n\nGDP is C + I + G + (X \u2013 M). GDP = $2,000 billion + $50 billion + $1,000 billion + ($20 billion \u2013 $40 billion) = $3,030\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following are included in GDP, and which are not?\n\n1.

Given what you learned in the [Clear It Up](#fs-idm64181600) \"How do statisticians measure GDP?\", does this surprise you? Or does this simply reflect the complexity of a modern economy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does GDP not tell us about the economy?\n\n\n\n\n### Problem\n\n\n\nLast year, a small nation with abundant forests cut down $200 worth of trees. $100 worth of trees were then turned into $150 worth of lumber. $100 worth of that lumber was used to produce $250 worth of bookshelves. Assuming the country produces no other outputs, and there are no other inputs used in the production of trees, lumber, and bookshelves, what is this nation's GDP?

The distinction is between nominal and real measurements, which refer to whether or not inflation has distorted a given statistic. Looking at economic statistics without considering inflation is like looking through a pair of binoculars and trying to guess how close something is: unless you know how strong the lenses are, you cannot guess the distance very accurately. Similarly, if you do not know the rate of inflation, it is difficult to figure out if a rise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced. The **nominal value**{: data-type=\"term\"} of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time. The **real value**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation. Generally, it is the real value that is more important.\n\n### Converting Nominal to Real GDP\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_19_05) shows U.S. GDP at five-year intervals since 1960 in nominal dollars; that is, GDP measured using the actual market prices prevailing in each stated year.

This conclusion would be highly misleading. Recall that nominal GDP is defined as the quantity of every good or service produced multiplied by the price at which it was sold, summed up for all goods and services. In order to see how much production has actually increased, we need to extract the effects of higher prices on nominal GDP. This can be easily done, using the GDP deflator.\n\n**GDP deflator**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy. We explore price indices in detail and how they are computed in [Inflation](/m48724){: .target-chapter}, but this definition will do in the context of this chapter. The data for the GDP deflator are given in [\\[link\\]](#Table_19_05) and shown graphically in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C19_010).\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C19_010 data-title=\"U.S. GDP Deflator, 1960&#x2013;2010 \"}\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C19_010) shows that the price level has risen dramatically since 1960. The price level in 2010 was almost six times higher than in 1960 (the deflator for 2010 was 110 versus a level of 19 in 1960). Clearly, much of the apparent growth in nominal GDP was due to inflation, not an actual change in the quantity of goods and services produced, in other words, not in real GDP. Recall that nominal GDP can rise for two reasons: an increase in output, and/or an increase in prices. What is needed is to extract the increase in prices from nominal GDP so as to measure only changes in output. After all, the dollars used to measure nominal GDP in 1960 are worth more than the inflated dollars of 1990\u2014and the price index tells exactly how much more. This adjustment is easy to do if you understand that nominal measurements are in value terms, where\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Value</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Price\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Quantity</mtext></mtd><mtd><mspace /></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0or</mtext></mtd><mtd><mspace /></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Nominal\u00a0GDP</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>GDP\u00a0Deflator\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Real\u00a0GDP</mtext></mtd><mtd /></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at an example at the micro level.

We start with the same formula as above:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Real\u00a0GDP</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>Nominal\u00a0GDP</mtext><mtext>Price\u00a0Index</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nFor reasons that will be explained in more detail below, mathematically, a price index is a two-digit decimal number like 1.00 or 0.85 or 1.25. Because some people have trouble working with decimals, when the price index is published, it has traditionally been multiplied by 100 to get integer numbers like 100, 85, or 125. What this means is that when we \u201cdeflate\u201d nominal figures to get real figures (by dividing the nominal by the price index). We also need to remember to divide the published price index by 100 to make the math work. So the formula becomes:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Real\u00a0GDP</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>Nominal\u00a0GDP</mtext><mtext>Price\u00a0Index\u00a0/\u00a0100</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nNow read the following Work It Out feature for more practice calculating real GDP.\n\n\n\nComputing GDP\n\nIt is possible to use the data in [\\[link\\]](#Table_19_05) to compute real GDP.\n\nStep 1. Look at [\\[link\\]](#Table_19_05), to see that, in 1960, nominal GDP was $543.3 billion and the price index (GDP deflator) was 19.0.\n\nStep 2. To calculate the real GDP in 1960, use the formula:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Real\u00a0GDP</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>Nominal\u00a0GDP</mtext><mtext>Price\u00a0Index\u00a0/\u00a0100</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>$543.3\u00a0billion</mtext><mtext>19\u00a0/\u00a0100</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>$2,859.5\u00a0billion</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nWe\u2019ll do this in two parts to make it clear. First adjust the price index: 19 divided by 100 = 0.19. Then divide into nominal GDP: $543.3 billion / 0.19 = $2,859.5 billion.\n\nStep 3. Use the same formula to calculate the real GDP in 1965.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Real\u00a0GDP</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>Nominal\u00a0GDP</mtext><mtext>Price\u00a0Index\u00a0/\u00a0100</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>$743.7\u00a0billion</mtext><mtext>20.3\u00a0/\u00a0100</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>$3,663.5\u00a0billion</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 4.

Whenever you compute a real statistic, one year (or period) plays a special role. It is called the base year (or base period). The base year is the year whose prices are used to compute the real statistic. When we calculate real GDP, for example, we take the quantities of goods and services produced in each year (for example, 1960 or 1973) and multiply them by their prices in the base year (in this case, 2005), so we get a measure of GDP that uses prices that do not change from year to year. That is why real GDP is labeled \u201cConstant Dollars\u201d or \u201c2005 Dollars,\u201d which means that real GDP is constructed using prices that existed in 2005.

However, over time, the rise in nominal GDP looks much larger than the rise in real GDP (that is, the **nominal GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} line rises more steeply than the real GDP line), because the rise in nominal GDP is exaggerated by the presence of inflation, especially in the 1970s.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C19_013 data-title=\"U.S. Nominal and Real GDP, 1960&#x2013;2012 \"}\n\nLet\u2019s return to the question posed originally: How much did GDP increase in real terms? What was the rate of growth of real GDP from 1960 to 2010? To find the real growth rate, we apply the formula for percentage change:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mfrac><mtext>2010\u00a0real\u00a0GDP\u00a0\u2013\u00a01960\u00a0real\u00a0GDP</mtext><mtext>1960\u00a0real\u00a0GDP</mtext></mfrac><mtext>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>%\u00a0change</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mfrac><mtext>13,598.5\u00a0\u2013\u00a02,859.5</mtext><mtext>2,859.5</mtext></mfrac><mtext>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0100</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>376%</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nIn other words, the U.S. economy has increased real production of goods and services by nearly a factor of four since 1960. Of course, that understates the material improvement since it fails to capture improvements in the quality of products and the invention of new products.\n\nThere is a quicker way to answer this question approximately, using another math trick. Because:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Nominal</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Price\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Quantity</mtext></mtd></mtr> <mtr><mtd><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0Nominal</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0Price\u00a0+\u00a0%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0Quantity</mtext></mtd></mtr> <mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0OR\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd /></mtr> <mtr><mtd><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0Quantity</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0Nominal\u00a0\u2013\u00a0%\u00a0change\u00a0in\u00a0Price</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nTherefore, the growth rate of real GDP (% change in quantity) equals the growth rate in nominal GDP (% change in value) minus the inflation rate (% change in price).\n\nNote that using this equation provides an approximation for small changes in the levels. For more accurate measures, one should use the first formula shown.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe nominal value of an economic statistic is the commonly announced value. The real value is the value after adjusting for changes in inflation. To convert nominal economic data from several different years into real, inflation-adjusted data, the starting point is to choose a base year arbitrarily and then use a price index to convert the measurements so that they are measured in the money prevailing in the base year.\n\n### Self-Check Question\n\n\n\nUsing data from [[link]](#Table_19_05) how much of the nominal GDP growth from 1980 to 1990 was real GDP and how much was inflation?\n\n\n\nFrom 1980 to 1990, real GDP grew by (8,225.0 \u2013 5,926.5) / (5,926.5) = 39%. Over the same period, prices increased by (72.7 \u2013 48.3) / (48.3/100) = 51%. So about 57% of the growth 51 / (51 + 39) was inflation, and the remainder: 39 / (51 + 39) = 43% was growth in real GDP.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a series of economic data over time measured in nominal terms versus the same data series over time measured in real terms?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you convert a series of nominal economic data over time to real terms?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question\n\n\n\nShould people typically pay more attention to their real income or their nominal income? If you choose the latter, why would that make sense in today\u2019s world? Would your answer be the same for the 1970s?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nThe \u201cprime\u201d interest rate is the rate that banks charge their best customers.

The generally upward long-term path of GDP has been regularly interrupted by short-term declines. A significant decline in real GDP is called a **recession**{: data-type=\"term\"}. An especially lengthy and deep recession is called a **depression**{: data-type=\"term\"}.

When real GDP rises, so does employment.\n\nThe most significant human problem associated with recessions (and their larger, uglier cousins, depressions) is that a slowdown in production means that firms need to lay off or fire some of the workers they have. Losing a job imposes painful financial and personal costs on workers, and often on their extended families as well. In addition, even those who keep their jobs are likely to find that wage raises are scanty at best\u2014or they may even be asked to take pay cuts.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_19_09) lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900.

However, the effects of a severe recession often linger on after the official ending date assigned by the NBER.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nOver the long term, U.S. real GDP have increased dramatically. At the same time, GDP has not increased the same amount each year. The speeding up and slowing down of GDP growth represents the business cycle. When GDP declines significantly, a recession occurs. A longer and deeper decline is a depression. Recessions begin at the peak of the business cycle and end at the trough.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWithout looking at [[link]](#Table_19_09), return to [[link]](#CNX_Econ_C19_008). If a recession is defined as a significant decline in national output, can you identify any post-1960 recessions in addition to the recession of 2008\u20132009? (This requires a judgment call.)\n\n\n\nTwo other major recessions are visible in the figure as slight dips: those of 1973\u20131975, and 1981\u20131982. Two other recessions appear in the figure as a flattening of the path of real GDP. These were in 1990\u20131991 and 2001.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to [[link]](#Table_19_09), how often have recessions occurred since the end of World War II (1945)?\n\n\n\n11 recessions in approximately 70 years averages about one recession every six years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to [[link]](#Table_19_09), how long has the average recession lasted since the end of World War II?\n\n\n\nThe table lists the \u201cMonths of Contraction\u201d for each recession. Averaging these figures for the post-WWII recessions gives an average duration of 11 months, or slightly less than a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to [[link]](#Table_19_09), how long has the average expansion lasted since the end of World War II?\n\n\n\nThe table lists the \u201cMonths of Expansion.\u201d Averaging these figures for the post-WWII expansions gives an average expansion of 60.5 months, or more than five years.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Question\n\n\n\nWhat are the typical patterns of GDP for a high-income economy like the United States in the long run and the short run?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhy do you suppose that U.S. GDP is so much higher today than 50 or 100 years ago?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think that GDP does not grow at a steady rate, but rather speeds up and slows down?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research. \u201cInformation on Recessions and Recoveries, the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee, and related topics.\u201d http://www.nber.org/cycles/main.html.\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nbusiness cycle\n: the relatively short-term movement of the economy in and out of recession\n^\n\ndepression\n: an especially lengthy and deep decline in output\n^\n\npeak\n: during the business cycle, the highest point of output before a recession begins\n^\n\nrecession\n: a significant decline in national output\n^\n\ntrough\n: during the business cycle, the lowest point of output in a recession, before a recovery begins", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

When comparing the GDP of different nations for this purpose, two issues immediately arise. First, the GDP of a country is measured in its own currency: the United States uses the U.S. dollar; Canada, the Canadian dollar; most countries of Western Europe, the euro; Japan, the yen; Mexico, the peso; and so on. Thus, comparing GDP between two countries requires converting to a common currency. A second issue is that countries have very different numbers of people. For instance, the United States has a much larger economy than Mexico or Canada, but it also has roughly three times as many people as Mexico and nine times as many people as Canada. So, if we are trying to compare standards of living across countries, we need to divide GDP by population.\n\n### Converting Currencies with Exchange Rates\n\nTo compare the GDP of countries with different currencies, it is necessary to convert to a \u201ccommon denominator\u201d using an **exchange rate**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency. Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A\u2019s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B\u2019s currency (for example, Japanese yen per British pound), or as the inverse (for example, British pounds per Japanese yen). Two types of exchange rates can be used for this purpose, market exchange rates and **purchasing power parity (PPP)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} equivalent exchange rates. Market exchange rates vary on a day-to-day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets. PPP-equivalent exchange rates provide a longer run measure of the exchange rate. For this reason, PPP-equivalent exchange rates are typically used for cross country comparisons of GDP. Exchange rates will be discussed in more detail in [Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows](/m48776){: .target-chapter}. The following Work It Out feature explains how to convert GDP to a common currency.\n\n\n\nConverting GDP to a Common Currency\n\nUsing the exchange rate to convert GDP from one currency to another is straightforward. Say that the task is to compare Brazil\u2019s GDP in 2013 of 4.8 trillion reals with the U.S. GDP of $16.6 trillion for the same year.\n\nStep 1. Determine the exchange rate for the specified year. In 2013, the exchange rate was 2.230 reals = $1. (These numbers are realistic, but rounded off to simplify the calculations.)\n\nStep 2. Convert Brazil\u2019s GDP into U.S. dollars:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Brazil's\u00a0GDP\u00a0in\u00a0$\u00a0U.S.</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>Brazil's\u00a0GDP\u00a0in\u00a0reals</mtext><mtext>Exchange\u00a0rate\u00a0(reals/$\u00a0U.S.)</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>4.8 trillion\u00a0reals</mtext><mtext>2.230\u00a0reals\u00a0per\u00a0$\u00a0U.S.</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>$2.2 trillion</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 3. Compare this value to the GDP in the United States in the same year. The U.S. GDP was $16.6 trillion in 2013, which is nearly eight times that of GDP in Brazil in 2012.\n\nStep 4.

The United States is also a populous country; in fact, it is the third largest country by population in the world, although well behind China and India. So is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than most other countries, or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per-person basis? This question can be answered by calculating a country\u2019s **GDP per capita**{: data-type=\"term\"}; that is, the GDP divided by the population.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>GDP\u00a0per\u00a0capita</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>GDP/population</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nThe second column of [\\[link\\]](#Table_19_11) lists the GDP of the same selection of countries that appeared in the previous [Tracking Real GDP over Time](/m48710) and [\\[link\\]](#Table_19_10), showing their GDP as converted into U.S. dollars (which is the same as the last column of the previous table). The third column gives the population for each country. The fourth column lists the GDP per capita. GDP per capita is obtained in two steps: First, by dividing column two (GDP, in billions of dollars) by 1000 so it has the same units as column three (Population, in millions). Then dividing the result (GDP in millions of dollars) by column three (Population, in millions).\n\n<table id=\"Table_19_11\" summary=\"This table has four columns and eleven rows.

India has a somewhat larger GDP than Germany, but on a per capita basis, Germany has more than 10 times India\u2019s standard of living. Will China soon have a better standard of living than the U.S.? Read the following Clear It Up feature to find out.\n\n\n\nIs China going to surpass the United States in terms of standard of living?\n\nAs shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_19_11), China has the second largest GDP of the countries: $9.5 trillion compared to the United States\u2019 $16.8 trillion. Perhaps it will surpass the United States, but probably not any time soon. China has a much larger population so that in per capita terms, its GDP is less than one fifth that of the United States ($6,958.70 compared to $53,001). The Chinese people are still quite poor relative to the United States and other developed countries. One caveat: For reasons to be discussed shortly, GDP per capita can give us only a rough idea of the differences in living standards across countries.\n\n\n\nThe high-income nations of the world\u2014including the United States, Canada, the Western European countries, and Japan\u2014typically have GDP per capita in the range of $20,000 to $50,000. Middle-income countries, which include much of Latin America, Eastern Europe, and some countries in East Asia, have GDP per capita in the range of $6,000 to $12,000. The low-income countries in the world, many of them located in Africa and Asia, often have GDP per capita of less than $2,000 per year.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nSince GDP is measured in a country\u2019s currency, in order to compare different countries\u2019 GDPs, we need to convert them to a common currency. One way to do that is with the exchange rate, which is the price of one country\u2019s currency in terms of another. Once GDPs are expressed in a common currency, we can compare each country\u2019s GDP per capita by dividing GDP by population. Countries with large populations often have large GDPs, but GDP alone can be a misleading indicator of the wealth of a nation. A better measure is GDP per capita.\n\n### Self-Check Question\n\n\n\nIs it possible for GDP to rise while at the same time per capita GDP is falling? Is it possible for GDP to fall while per capita GDP is rising?\n\n\n\nYes. The answer to both questions depends on whether GDP is growing faster or slower than population. If population grows faster than GDP, GDP increases, while GDP per capita decreases. If GDP falls, but population falls faster, then GDP decreases, while GDP per capita increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Central African Republic has a GDP of 1,107,689 million CFA francs and a population of 4.862 million. The exchange rate is 284.681CFA francs per dollar. Calculate the GDP per capita of Central African Republic.\n\n\n\nStart with Central African Republic\u2019s GDP measured in francs. Divide it by the exchange rate to convert to U.S. dollars, and then divide by population to obtain the per capita figure. That is, 1,107,689 million francs / 284.681 francs per dollar / 4.862 million people = $800.28 GDP per capita.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Question\n\n\n\nWhat are the two main difficulties that arise in comparing the GDP of different countries?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question\n\n\n\nCross country comparisons of GDP per capita typically use purchasing power parity equivalent exchange rates, which are a measure of the long run equilibrium value of an exchange rate. In fact, we used PPP equivalent exchange rates in this module. Why could using market exchange rates, which sometimes change dramatically in a short period of time, be misleading?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might per capita GDP be only an imperfect measure of a country\u2019s standard of living?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nEthiopia has a GDP of $8 billion (measured in U.S. dollars) and a population of 55 million. Costa Rica has a GDP of $9 billion (measured in U.S. dollars) and a population of 4 million. Calculate the per capita GDP for each country and identify which one is higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1980, Denmark had a GDP of $70 billion (measured in U.S. dollars) and a population of 5.1 million. In 2000, Denmark had a GDP of $160 billion (measured in U.S. dollars) and a population of 5.3 million. By what percentage did Denmark\u2019s GDP per capita rise between 1980 and 2000?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Czech Republic has a GDP of 1,800 billion koruny. The exchange rate is 20 koruny/U.S. dollar. The Czech population is 20 million.

While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in markets, **standard of living**{: data-type=\"term\"} includes all elements that affect people\u2019s well-being, whether they are bought and sold in the market or not. To illuminate the gap between GDP and standard of living, it is useful to spell out some things that GDP does not cover that are clearly relevant to standard of living.\n\n### Limitations of GDP as a Measure of the Standard of Living\n\nWhile GDP includes spending on recreation and travel, it does not cover leisure time. Clearly, however, there is a substantial difference between an economy that is large because people work long hours, and an economy that is just as large because people are more productive with their time so they do not have to work as many hours. The GDP per capita of the U.S. economy is larger than the GDP per capita of Germany, as was shown in [\\[link\\]](/m48711#Table_19_11), but does that prove that the standard of living in the United States is higher? Not necessarily, since it is also true that the average U.S. worker works several hundred hours more per year more than the average German worker. The calculation of GDP does not take the German worker\u2019s extra weeks of vacation into account.\n\nWhile GDP includes what is spent on environmental protection, healthcare, and education, it does not include actual levels of environmental cleanliness, health, and learning. GDP includes the cost of buying pollution-control equipment, but it does not address whether the air and water are actually cleaner or dirtier. GDP includes spending on medical care, but does not address whether life expectancy or infant mortality have risen or fallen. Similarly, it counts spending on education, but does not address directly how much of the population can read, write, or do basic mathematics.\n\nGDP includes production that is exchanged in the market, but it does not cover production that is not exchanged in the market. For example, hiring someone to mow your lawn or clean your house is part of GDP, but doing these tasks yourself is not part of GDP. One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent decades is that, as of 1970, only about 42% of women participated in the paid labor force. By the second decade of the 2000s, nearly 60% of women participated in the paid labor force according to the **Bureau of Labor Statistics**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. As women are now in the labor force, many of the services they used to produce in the non-market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the market economy, which makes the GDP appear larger even if more services are not actually being consumed.\n\nGDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society. **GDP per capita**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is only an average. When GDP per capita rises by 5%, it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5%, or that of some groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less\u2014or even declined. GDP also has nothing in particular to say about the amount of variety available. If a family buys 100 loaves of bread in a year, GDP does not care whether they are all white bread, or whether the family can choose from wheat, rye, pumpernickel, and many others\u2014it just looks at whether the total amount spent on bread is the same.\n\nLikewise, GDP has nothing much to say about what technology and products are available. The standard of living in, for example, 1950 or 1900 was not affected only by how much money people had\u2014it was also affected by what they could buy. No matter how much money you had in 1950, you could not buy an iPhone or a personal computer.\n\nIn certain cases, it is not clear that a rise in GDP is even a good thing. If a city is wrecked by a hurricane, and then experiences a surge of rebuilding construction activity, it would be peculiar to claim that the hurricane was therefore economically beneficial. If people are led by a rising fear of crime, to pay for installation of bars and burglar alarms on all their windows, it is hard to believe that this increase in GDP has made them better off. In that same vein, some people would argue that sales of certain goods, like pornography or extremely violent movies, do not represent a gain to society\u2019s standard of living.\n\n### Does a Rise in GDP Overstate or Understate the Rise in the Standard of Living?\n\nThe fact that GDP per capita does not fully capture the broader idea of standard of living has led to a concern that the increases in GDP over time are illusory. It is theoretically possible that while GDP is rising, the standard of living could be falling if human health, environmental cleanliness, and other factors that are not included in GDP are worsening. Fortunately, this fear appears to be overstated.\n\nIn some ways, the rise in GDP understates the actual rise in the standard of living. For example, the typical workweek for a U.S. worker has fallen over the last century from about 60 hours per week to less than 40 hours per week. Life expectancy and health have risen dramatically, and so has the average level of education. Since 1970, the air and water in the United States have generally been getting cleaner. New technologies have been developed for entertainment, travel, information, and health. A much wider variety of basic products like food and clothing is available today than several decades ago. Because GDP does not capture leisure, health, a cleaner environment, the possibilities created by new technology, or an increase in variety, the actual rise in the standard of living for Americans in recent decades has exceeded the rise in GDP.\n\nOn the other side, rates of crime, levels of traffic congestion, and inequality of incomes are higher in the United States now than they were in the 1960s. Moreover, a substantial number of services that used to be provided, primarily by women, in the non-market economy are now part of the market economy that is counted by GDP. By ignoring these factors, GDP would tend to overstate the true rise in the standard of living.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read about the American Dream and standards of living.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### GDP is Rough, but Useful\n\nA high level of GDP should not be the only goal of macroeconomic policy, or government policy more broadly. Even though GDP does not measure the broader standard of living with any precision, it does measure production well and it does indicate when a country is materially better or worse off in terms of jobs and incomes. In most countries, a significantly higher GDP per capita occurs hand in hand with other improvements in everyday life along many dimensions, like education, health, and environmental protection.\n\nNo single number can capture all the elements of a term as broad as \u201cstandard of living.\u201d Nonetheless, GDP per capita is a reasonable, rough-and-ready measure of the standard of living.\n\n\n\nHow is the Economy Doing? How Does One Tell?\n\nTo determine the state of the economy, one needs to examine economic indicators, such as GDP. To calculate GDP is quite an undertaking. It is the broadest measure of a nation\u2019s economic activity and we owe a debt to Simon Kuznets, the creator of the measurement, for that.\n\nThe sheer size of the U.S. economy as measured by GDP is huge\u2014as of the third quarter of 2013, $16.6 trillion worth of goods and services were produced annually. Real GDP informed us that the recession of 2008\u20132009 was a severe one and that the recovery from that has been slow, but is improving. GDP per capita gives a rough estimate of a nation\u2019s standard of living. This chapter is the building block for other chapters that explore more economic indicators such as unemployment, inflation, or interest rates, and perhaps more importantly, will explain how they are related and what causes them to rise or fall.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nGDP is an indicator of a society\u2019s standard of living, but it is only a rough indicator. GDP does not directly take account of leisure, environmental quality, levels of health and education, activities conducted outside the market, changes in inequality of income, increases in variety, increases in technology, or the (positive or negative) value that society may place on certain types of output.\n\n### Self-Check Question\n\n\n\nExplain briefly whether each of the following would cause GDP to overstate or understate the degree of change in the broad standard of living.\n\n1.  The environment becomes dirtier\n2.  The crime rate declines\n3.  A greater variety of goods become available to consumers\n4.  Infant mortality declines\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.

A greater variety of goods would raise the broad standard of living, but not be counted directly in GDP, and so a rise in GDP would understate the rise in the standard of living.\n4.

The economist Brad DeLong estimates that the average worker in the early 1600s earned wages that could afford him 2,500 food calories. This worker lived in Western Europe. Two hundred years later, that same worker could afford 3,000 food calories. However, between 1800 and 1875, just a time span of just 75 years, economic growth was so rapid that western European workers could purchase 5,000 food calories a day. By 2012, a low skilled worker in an affluent Western European/North American country could afford to purchase 2.4 million food calories per day.\n\nWhat caused such a rapid rise in living standards between 1800 and 1875 and thereafter? Why is it that many countries, especially those in Western Europe, North America, and parts of East Asia, can feed their populations more than adequately, while others cannot? We will look at these and other questions as we examine long-run economic growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Economic Growth\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic Growth\n* Labor Productivity and Economic Growth\n* Components of Economic Growth\n* Economic Convergence\n\n\n\nEvery country worries about economic growth. In the United States and other high-income countries, the question is whether economic growth continues to provide the same remarkable gains in our standard of living as it did during the twentieth century. Meanwhile, can middle-income countries like South Korea, Brazil, Egypt, or Poland catch up to the higher-income countries? Or must they remain in the second tier of per capita income? Of the world\u2019s population of roughly 6.7 billion people, about 2.6 billion are scraping by on incomes that average less than $2 per day, not that different from the standard of living 2,000 years ago. Can the world\u2019s poor be lifted from their fearful poverty? As the 1995 Nobel laureate in economics, Robert E. Lucas Jr., once noted: \u201cThe consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else.\u201d\n\nDramatic improvements in a nation\u2019s standard of living are possible. After the Korean War in the late 1950s, the Republic of Korea, often called South Korea, was one of the poorest economies in the world. Most South Koreans worked in peasant agriculture. According to the British economist Angus Maddison, whose life\u2019s work was the measurement of GDP and population in the world economy, GDP per capita in 1990 international dollars was $854 per year. From the 1960s to the early twenty-first century, a time period well within the lifetime and memory of many adults, the South Korean economy grew rapidly. Over these four decades, GDP per capita increased by more than 6% per year. According to the World Bank, GDP for South Korea now exceeds $30,000 in nominal terms, placing it firmly among high-income countries like Italy, New Zealand, and Israel. Measured by total GDP in 2012, South Korea is the thirteenth-largest economy in the world. For a nation of 49 million people, this transformation is extraordinary.\n\nSouth Korea is a standout example, but it is not the only case of rapid and sustained economic growth. Other nations of East Asia, like Thailand and Indonesia, have seen very rapid growth as well. China has grown enormously since market-oriented economic reforms were enacted around 1980.

(Later in the chapter we will discuss lower rates of economic growth and some key ingredients for economic progress.) Rapid and sustained economic growth is a relatively recent experience for the human race. Before the last two centuries, although rulers, nobles, and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence level, the average person\u2019s standard of living had not changed much for centuries.\n\nProgressive, powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. According to the Dutch economic historian **Jan Luiten van Zanden**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, slavery-based societies, favorable demographics, global trading routes, and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed. The **Industrial Revolution**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines\u2014the steam engine, the power loom, and the steam locomotive\u2014performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the United States, Germany, and other countries.\n\nThe jobs for ordinary people working with these machines were often dirty and dangerous by modern standards, but the alternative jobs of that time in peasant agriculture and small-village industry were often dirty and dangerous, too. The new jobs of the Industrial Revolution typically offered higher pay and a chance for social mobility. A self-reinforcing cycle began: New inventions and investments generated profits, the profits provided funds for new investment and inventions, and the investments and inventions provided opportunities for further profits. Slowly, a group of national economies in Europe and North America emerged from centuries of sluggishness into a period of rapid modern growth. During the last two centuries, the average rate of growth of GDP per capita in the leading industrialized countries has averaged about 2% per year. What were times like before then? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer.\n\n\n\nWhat were economic conditions like before 1870?\n\nAngus Maddison, a quantitative economic historian, led the most systematic inquiry into national incomes before 1870. His methods recently have been refined and used to compile GDP per capita estimates from year 1 C.E. to 1348. [\\[link\\]](#Table_20_01) is an important counterpoint to most of the narrative in this chapter. It shows that nations can decline as well as rise. The declines in income are explained by a wide array of forces, such as epidemics, natural and weather-related disasters, the inability to govern large empires, and the remarkably slow pace of technological and institutional progress. Institutions are the traditions, laws, and so on by which people in a community agree to behave and govern themselves. Such institutions include marriage, religion, education, and laws of governance. Institutional progress is the development and codification of these institutions to reinforce social order, and thus, economic growth.\n\nOne example of such an institution is the Magna Carta (Great Charter), which the English nobles forced King John to sign in 1215. The Magna Carta codified the principles of due process, whereby a free man could not be penalized unless his peers had made a lawful judgment against him. This concept was later adopted by the United States in its own constitution. This social order may have contributed to England\u2019s GDP per capita in 1348, which was second to that of northern Italy.\n\nIn the study of economic growth, a country\u2019s institutional framework plays a critical role. [\\[link\\]](#Table_20_01) also shows relative global equality for almost 1,300 years. After this, we begin to see significant divergence in income (not shown in table).\n\n<table id=\"Table_20_01\" summary=\"This table has eight rows and nine columns.

At its height, the empire spanned large regions of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain until its gradual decline over 200 years.\n\n\n\nThe Industrial Revolution led to increasing inequality among nations. Some economies took off, whereas others, like many of those in Africa or Asia, remained close to a subsistence standard of living. General calculations show that the 17 countries of the world with the most-developed economies had, on average, 2.4 times the GDP per capita of the world\u2019s poorest economies in 1870. By 1960, the most developed economies had 4.2 times the GDP per capita of the poorest economies.\n\nHowever, by the middle of the twentieth century, some countries had shown that catching up was possible. Japan\u2019s economic growth took off in the 1960s and 1970s, with a growth rate of real GDP per capita averaging 11% per year during those decades. Certain countries in Latin America experienced a boom in economic growth in the 1960s as well. In Brazil, for example, GDP per capita expanded by an average annual rate of 11.1% from 1968 to 1973. In the 1970s, some East Asian economies, including South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan, saw rapid growth. In these countries, growth rates of 11% to 12% per year in GDP per capita were not uncommon. More recently, China, with its population of 1.3 billion people, grew at a per capita rate 9% per year from 1984 into the 2000s. India, with a population of 1.1 billion, has shown promising signs of economic growth, with growth in GDP per capita of about 4% per year during the 1990s and climbing toward 7% to 8% per year in the 2000s.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read about the Asian Development Bank.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nThese waves of catch-up economic growth have not reached all shores. In certain African countries like Niger, Tanzania, and Sudan, for example, GDP per capita at the start of the 2000s was still less than $300, not much higher than it was in the nineteenth century and for centuries before that. In the context of the overall situation of low-income people around the world, the good economic news from China (population: 1.3 billion) and India (population: 1.1 billion) is, nonetheless, astounding and heartening.\n\nEconomic growth in the last two centuries has made a striking change in the human condition. **Richard Easterlin**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, an economist at the University of Southern California, wrote in 2000:\n\n<q>By many measures, a revolution in the human condition is sweeping the world. Most people today are better fed, clothed, and housed than their predecessors two centuries ago. They are healthier, live longer, and are better educated. Women\u2019s lives are less centered on reproduction and political democracy has gained a foothold. Although Western Europe and its offshoots have been the leaders of this advance, most of the less developed nations have joined in during the 20th century, with the newly emerging nations of sub-Saharan Africa the latest to participate. Although the picture is not one of universal progress, it is the greatest advance in the human condition of the world\u2019s population ever achieved in such a brief span of time.</q>\n\n### Rule of Law and Economic Growth\n\nEconomic growth depends on many factors. Key among those factors is adherence to the **rule of law**{: data-type=\"term\"} and protection of **property rights**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **contractual rights**{: data-type=\"term\"} by a country\u2019s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently. Laws must be clear, public, fair, enforced, and equally applicable to all members of society. Property rights, as you might recall from [Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities](/m48668){: .target-chapter} are the rights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit. If you have $100, you have the right to use that money, whether you spend it, lend it, or keep it in a jar. It is your property. The definition of property includes physical property as well as the right to your training and experience, especially since your training is what determines your livelihood. The use of this property includes the right to enter into contracts with other parties with your property. Individuals or firms must own the property to enter into a contract.\n\nContractual rights, then, are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with others regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of noncompliance. One example is the employment agreement: a skilled surgeon operates on an ill person and expects to get paid. Failure to pay would constitute a theft of property by the patient; that property being the services provided by the surgeon. In a society with strong property rights and contractual rights, the terms of the patient\u2013surgeon contract will be fulfilled, because the surgeon would have recourse through the court system to extract payment from that individual. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people would not be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-payment. This would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.\n\nThe World Bank considers a country\u2019s legal system effective if it upholds property rights and contractual rights. The World Bank has developed a ranking system for countries\u2019 legal systems based on effective protection of property rights and rule-based governance using a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 being the lowest and 6 the highest rating. In 2013, the world average ranking was 2.9. The three countries with the lowest ranking of 1.5 were Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, and Zimbabwe; their GDP per capita was $679, $333, and $1,007 respectively. Afghanistan is cited by the World Bank as having a low standard of living, weak government structure, and lack of adherence to the rule of law, which has stymied its economic growth. The landlocked Central African Republic has poor economic resources as well as political instability and is a source of children used in human trafficking. Zimbabwe has had declining growth since 1998. Land redistribution and price controls have disrupted the economy, and corruption and violence have dominated the political process. Although global economic growth has increased, those countries lacking a clear system of property rights and an independent court system free from corruption have lagged far behind.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nSince the early nineteenth century, there has been a spectacular process of long-run economic growth during which the world\u2019s leading economies\u2014mostly those in Western Europe and North America\u2014expanded GDP per capita at an average rate of about 2% per year. In the last half-century, countries like Japan, South Korea, and China have shown the potential to catch up. The extensive process of economic growth, often referred to as modern economic growth, was facilitated by the Industrial Revolution, which increased worker productivity and trade, as well as the development of governance and market institutions.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nExplain what the Industrial Revolution was and where it began.\n\n\n\nThe Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines\u2014the steam engine, the power loom, and the steam locomotive\u2014performed tasks that would have taken vast numbers of workers to do. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the United States, Germany, and other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain the difference between property rights and contractual rights. Why do they matter to economic growth?\n\n\n\nProperty rights are the rights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit. Contractual rights are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with others regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of noncompliance. Economic growth occurs when the standard of living increases in an economy, which occurs when output is increasing and incomes are rising. For this to happen, societies must create a legal environment that gives individuals the ability to use their property to their fullest and highest use, including the right to trade or sell that property. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people would not be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-payment. This would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nHow did the Industrial Revolution increase the rate of economic growth and income levels in the United States?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow much should a nation be concerned if its rate of economic growth is just 2% slower than other nations?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question\n\n\n\nOver the past 50 years, many countries have experienced an annual growth rate in real GDP per capita greater than that of the United States. Some examples are China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Does that mean the United States is regressing relative to other countries? Does that mean these countries will eventually overtake the United States in terms of rate of growth of real GDP per capita? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nBolt, Jutta, and Jan Luiten van Zanden. \u201cThe Maddison Project: The First Update of the Maddison Project Re-Estimating Growth Before 1820 (Maddison-Project Working Paper WP-4).\u201d *University of Groningen: Groningen Growth and Development Centre*.

{"module_id": "m48715", "module_title": "Economics - m48715", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48715", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Identify the role of labor productivity in promoting economic growth\n* Analyze the sources of economic growth using the aggregate production function\n* Measure an economy\u2019s rate of productivity growth\n* Evaluate the power of sustained growth\n\n\n\nSustained long-term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity, which essentially means how well we do things. In other words, how efficient is your nation with its time and workers? **Labor productivity**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input. The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread. In this fictional example, the Canadians are more productive. Being more productive essentially means you can do more in the same amount of time. This in turn frees up resources to be used elsewhere.\n\nWhat determines how productive workers are? The answer is pretty intuitive. The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital. **Human capital**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the accumulated knowledge (from education and experience), skills, and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses. Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy, the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity.\n\nThe second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change. **Technological change**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a combination of **invention**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014advances in knowledge\u2014and **innovation**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service. For example, the transistor was invented in 1947. It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it. Innovations since then have produced smaller and better transistors that that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart-phones, computers, and escalators. The development of the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller devices. These devices can be used to communicate with other workers, measure product quality or do any other task in less time, improving worker productivity.\n\nThe third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale. Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size. (Read more about economies of scale in [Cost and Industry Structure](/m48620){: .target-chapter}.) Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour. If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale, it could be that Canadian workers had access to a large industrial-size oven while the U.S. worker was using a standard residential size oven.\n\nNow that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity, let\u2019s turn to how economists measure economic growth and productivity.\n\n### Sources of Economic Growth: The Aggregate Production Function\n\nTo analyze the sources of economic growth, it is useful to think about a **production function**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is the process of turning economic inputs like labor, machinery, and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers. A microeconomic production function describes the inputs and outputs of a firm, or perhaps an industry. In macroeconomics, the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy is called an **aggregate production function**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\n### Components of the Aggregate Production Function\n\nEconomists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C20_003) presents two examples of aggregate production functions. In the first production function, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C20_003) (a), the output is GDP. The inputs in this example are workforce, human capital, physical capital, and technology. We discuss these inputs further in the module, Components of Economic Growth.\n\n  This aggregate production function has GDP as its output. (b) This aggregate production function has GDP per capita as its output. Because it is calculated on a per-person basis, the labor input is already figured into the other factors and does not need to be listed separately.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C20_003 data-title=\"Aggregate Production Functions \"}\n\n### Measuring Productivity\n\nAn economy\u2019s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita, although the two are not identical. For example, if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases, GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected. Over the long term, the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if there are complementary increases in capital.\n\nA common measure of U.S. productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer\u2019s output. This measure excludes government workers, because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure. It also excludes farming, which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U.S. economy. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C20_009) shows an index of output per hour, with 2009 as the base year (when the index equals 100). The index equaled about 106 in 2014. In 1972, the index equaled 50, which shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C20_009 data-title=\"Output per Hour Worked in the U.S. Economy, 1947&#x2013;2011 \"}\n\nAccording to the Department of Labor, U.S. productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s. In fact, the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3.2% per year from 1950 to 1970; dropped to 1.9% per year from 1970 to 1990; and then climbed back to over 2.3% from 1991 to the present, with another modest slowdown after 2001. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C20_007) shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged over time since 1950.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C20_007 data-title=\"Productivity Growth Since 1950 \"}\n\n### The \u201cNew Economy\u201d Controversy\n\nIn recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U.S. productivity in the second half of the 1990s. One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a \u201cnew economy\u201d based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s. The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come. The pessimists, on the other hand, argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher productivity will last for the long term. It is hard to infer anything about long-term productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s, because the steep recession of 2008\u20132009, with its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment, complicates any interpretation. While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 (around 3%), it has slowed down since then.\n\n**Productivity growth**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is also closely linked to the average level of wages. Over time, the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce. If a few employers tried to pay their workers less than what those workers produced, then those workers would receive offers of higher wages from other profit-seeking employers. If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what those workers produced, those employers would soon end up with losses. In the long run, productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy. To learn how to compare economies in this regard, follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature.\n\n\n\nComparing the Economies of Two Countries\n\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) tracks data on the annual growth rate of real GDP per hour worked. You can find these data on the OECD data webpage \u201cLabour productivity growth in the total economy\u201d at [this][1] website.\n\nStep 1. Visit the OECD website given above and select two countries to compare.\n\nStep 2. On the drop-down menu \u201cVariable,\u201d select \u201cReal GDP, Annual Growth, in percent\u201d and record the data for the countries you have chosen for the five most recent years.\n\nStep 3. Go back to the drop-down menu and select \u201cReal GDP per Hour Worked, Annual Growth Rate, in percent\u201d and select data for the same years for which you selected GDP data.\n\nStep 4. Compare real GDP growth for both countries. [\\[link\\]](#Table_20_02) provides an example of a comparison between Australia and Belgium.\n\n| **Australia** | **2009** | **2010** | **2011** | **2012** | **2013** |\n| Real GDP Growth (%) | 0.1% | 1.0% | 2.2% | 0.8 | 0.7% |\n| Real GDP Growth/Hours Worked (%) | 1.9% | \u20130.3% | 2.4% | 3.3% | 1.4% |\n| **Belgium** | **2009** | **2010** | **2011** | **2012** | **2013** |\n| Real GDP Growth (%) | \u20133.4 | 1.6 | 0.8 | \u20130.6 | \u20130.2 |\n| Real GDP Growth/Hours Worked (%) | \u20131.3 | \u20131.4 | \u20130.5 | \u20130.3 | 0.3 |\n{: #Table_20_02 summary=\"This table has six columns and four main rows.

For example, one factor that may have affected Australia is its isolation from Europe, which may have insulated the country from the effects of the global recession. In Belgium\u2019s case, the global recession seems to have had an impact on both GDP and real GDP per hours worked between 2009 and 2013, though productivity does seem to be recovering.\n\n\n\n### The Power of Sustained Economic Growth\n\nNothing is more important for people\u2019s standard of living than sustained economic growth. Even small changes in the rate of growth, when sustained and compounded over long periods of time, make an enormous difference in the standard of living. Consider [\\[link\\]](#Table_20_03), in which the rows of the table show several different rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time. Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100. The table then applies the following formula to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><msup><mtext>GDP\u00a0at\u00a0starting\u00a0date\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0(1\u00a0+\u00a0growth\u00a0rate\u00a0of\u00a0GDP)</mtext><mtext>years</mtext></msup><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0GDP\u00a0at\u00a0end\u00a0date</mtext></math>\n\n\nFor example, an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3% per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years; that is, 100 (1.03)<sup>25</sup> = 209.\n\nThe slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table, just 1% per year, is similar to what the United States experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth. The second highest rate, 3% per year, is close to what the U.S. economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s. Higher rates of per capita growth, such as 5% or 8% per year, represent the experience of rapid growth in economies like Japan, Korea, and China.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_20_03) shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if sustained and compounded over time. For example, an economy growing at a 1% annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64%, from 100 to 164 in this example. However, a country growing at a 5% annual rate will see (almost) the same amount of growth\u2014from 100 to 163\u2014over just 10 years. Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation. (See the following Clear It Up feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates.) If the rate of growth is 8%, young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the time they reach age 30, and grow nearly sevenfold by the time they reach age 45.\n\n<table id=\"Table_20_03\" summary=\"This table has five rows and four columns. the first row is a header row and it labels each column &#x201C;Growth Rate&#x201D;, &#x201C;Value of an original 100 in 10 years&#x201D;, &#x201C;Value of an original 100 in 25 years&#x201D;, and &#x201C;Value of an original 100 in 50 years&#x201D;.

Both formulas have the same ingredients:\n\n* an original starting amount, in one case GDP and in the other case an amount of financial saving;\n* a percentage increase over time, in one case the growth rate of GDP and in the other case an interest rate;\n* and an amount of time over which this effect happens.\n{: data-bullet-style=\"bullet\"}\n\nRecall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest. It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time. Similarly, compound rates of economic growth, or the **compound growth rate**{: data-type=\"term\"}, means that the rate of growth is being multiplied by a base that includes past GDP growth, with dramatic effects over time.\n\nFor example, in 2013, the World Fact Book, produced by the Central Intelligence Agency, reported that South Korea had a GDP of $1.67 trillion with a growth rate of 2.8%. We can estimate that at that growth rate, South Korea\u2019s GDP will be $1.92 trillion in five years. If we apply the growth rate to each year\u2019s ending GDP for the next five years, we will calculate that at the end of year one, GDP is $1.72 trillion. In year two, we start with the end-of-year one value of $1.67 and increase it by 2%. Year three starts with the end-of-year two GDP, and we increase it by 2% and so on, as depicted in the [\\[link\\]](#Table_20_04).\n\n| Year | Starting GDP | Growth Rate 2% | Year-End Amount |\n|----------\n| 1 | $1.67 Trillion \u00d7 | (1+0.028) | $1.72 Trillion |\n| 2 | $1.72 Trillion \u00d7 | (1+0.028) | $1.76 Trillion |\n| 3 | $1.76 Trillion \u00d7 | (1+0.028) | $1.81 Trillion |\n| 4 | $1.81 Trillion \u00d7 | (1+0.028) | $1.87 Trillion |\n| 5 | $1.87 Trillion \u00d7 | (1+0.028) | $1.92 Trillion |\n{: #Table_20_04 summary=\"This table has four columns and five rows.

The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989. Since then, U.S. productivity has rebounded (the current global recession notwithstanding). It is not clear whether the current growth in productivity will be sustained. The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an economy\u2019s rate of long-term economic growth and higher wages. Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy, like human capital, physical capital, and technology, lead to the output measured as GDP per capita.\n\nCompound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates. Seemingly small changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nAre there other ways in which we can measure productivity besides the amount produced per hour of work?\n\n\n\nYes. Since productivity is output per unit of input, we can measure productivity using GDP (output) per worker (input).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume there are two countries: South Korea and the United States. South Korea grows at 4% and the United States grows at 1%. For the sake of simplicity, assume they both start from the same fictional income level, $10,000. What will the incomes of the United States and South Korea be in 20 years? By how many multiples will each country\u2019s income grow in 20 years?\n\n\n\nIn 20 years the United States will have an income of 10,000 \u00d7 (1 + 0.01)<sup>20</sup> = $12,201.90, and South Korea will have an income of 10,000 \u00d7 (1 + 0.04)<sup>20</sup> = $21,911.23. South Korea has grown by a multiple of 2.1 and the United States by a multiple of 1.2.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nHow is GDP per capita calculated differently from labor productivity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do gains in labor productivity lead to gains in GDP per capita?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\n[Labor Productivity and Economic Growth](/m48715) outlined the logic of how increased productivity is associated with increased wages. Detail a situation where this is not the case and explain why it is not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in labor productivity is one of the most watched international statistics of growth. Visit the St. Louis Federal Reserve website and find the data section (http://research.stlouisfed.org). Find international comparisons of labor productivity, listed under the FRED Economic database (Growth Rate of Total Labor Productivity), and compare two countries in the recent past. State what you think the reasons for differences in labor productivity could be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefer back to the [Work It Out](#fs-idm14493936) about Comparing the Economies of Two Countries and examine the data for the two countries you chose. How are they similar? How are they different?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nAn economy starts off with a GDP per capita of $5,000. How large will the GDP per capita be if it grows at an annual rate of 2% for 20 years? 2% for 40 years? 4% for 40 years? 6% for 40 years?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn economy starts off with a GDP per capita of 12,000 euros. How large will the GDP per capita be if it grows at an annual rate of 3% for 10 years? 3% for 30 years? 6% for 30 years?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay that the average worker in Canada has a productivity level of $30 per hour while the average worker in the United Kingdom has a productivity level of $25 per hour (both measured in U.S. dollars). Over the next five years, say that worker productivity in Canada grows at 1% per year while worker productivity in the UK grows 3% per year. After five years, who will have the higher productivity level, and by how much?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay that the average worker in the U.S. economy is eight times as productive as an average worker in Mexico. If the productivity of U.S. workers grows at 2% for 25 years and the productivity of Mexico\u2019s workers grows at 6% for 25 years, which country will have higher worker productivity at that point?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\naggregate production function\n: the process whereby an economy as a whole turns economic inputs such as human capital, physical capital, and technology into output measured as GDP per capita\n^\n\ncompound growth rate\n: the rate of growth when multiplied by a base that includes past GDP growth\n^\n\nhuman capital\n: the accumulated skills and education of workers\n^\n\ninnovation\n: putting advances in knowledge to use in a new product or service\n^\n\ninvention\n: advances in knowledge\n^\n\nlabor productivity\n: the value of what is produced per worker, or per hour worked (sometimes called worker productivity)\n^\n\nproduction function\n: the process whereby a firm turns economic inputs like labor, machinery, and raw materials into outputs like goods and services used by consumers\n^\n\ntechnological change\n: a combination of invention\u2014advances in knowledge\u2014and innovation\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=PDB_GR", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

In this module, we discuss some of the components of economic growth, including physical capital, human capital, and technology.\n\nThe category of **physical capital**{: data-type=\"term\"} includes the plant and equipment used by firms and also things like roads (also called **infrastructure**{: data-type=\"term\"}). Again, greater physical capital implies more output. Physical capital can affect productivity in two ways: (1) an increase in the *quantity* of physical capital (for example, more computers of the same quality); and (2) an increase in the *quality* of physical capital (same number of computers but the computers are faster, and so on). Human capital and physical capital accumulation are similar: In both cases, investment now pays off in longer-term productivity in the future.\n\nThe category of **technology**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the \u201cjoker in the deck.\u201d Earlier we described it as the combination of invention and innovation. When most people think of new technology, the invention of new products like the laser, the smartphone, or some new wonder drug come to mind. In food production, the development of more drought-resistant seeds is another example of technology. Technology, as economists use the term, however, includes still more. It includes new ways of organizing work, like the invention of the assembly line, new methods for ensuring better quality of output in factories, and innovative institutions that facilitate the process of converting inputs into output. In short, technology comprises all the advances that make the existing machines and other inputs produce more, and at higher quality, as well as altogether new products.\n\nIt may not make sense to compare the GDPs of China and say, Benin, simply because of the great difference in population size. To understand economic growth, which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person, it is often useful to focus on **GDP per capita**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Using GDP per capita also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people, like Belgium, Uruguay, or Zimbabwe, with countries that have larger populations, like the United States, the Russian Federation, or Nigeria.\n\nTo obtain a per capita production function, divide each input in [\\[link\\]](/m48715#CNX_Econ_C20_003)(a) by the population. This creates a second **aggregate production function**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} where the output is GDP per capita (that is, GDP divided by population). The inputs are the average level of human capital per person, the average level of physical capital per person, and the level of technology per person\u2014see [\\[link\\]](/m48715#CNX_Econ_C20_003)(b). The result of having population in the denominator is mathematically appealing. Increases in population lower per capita income. However, increasing population is important for the average person only if the rate of income growth exceeds population growth. A more important reason for constructing a per capita production function is to understand the contribution of human and physical capital.\n\n### Capital Deepening\n\nWhen society increases the level of capital per person, the result is called **capital deepening**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per worker.\n\nRecall that one way to measure human capital is to look at the average levels of education in an economy. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C20_010) illustrates the human capital deepening for U.S. workers by showing that the proportion of the U.S. population with a high school and a college degree is rising. As recently as 1970, for example, only about half of U.S. adults had at least a high school diploma; by the start of the twenty-first century, more than 80% of adults had graduated from high school. The idea of human capital deepening also applies to the years of experience that workers have, but the average experience level of U.S. workers has not changed much in recent decades. Thus, the key dimension for deepening human capital in the U.S. economy focuses more on additional education and training than on a higher average level of work experience.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C20_010 data-title=\"Human Capital Deepening in the U.S. \"}\n\nPhysical capital deepening in the U.S. economy is shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C20_008). The average U.S. worker in the late 2000s was working with physical capital worth almost three times as much as that of the average worker of the early 1950s.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C20_008 data-title=\"Physical Capital per Worker in the United States \"}\n\nNot only does the current U.S. economy have better-educated workers with more and improved physical capital than it did several decades ago, but these workers have access to more advanced technologies. Growth in technology is impossible to measure with a simple line on a graph, but evidence that we live in an age of technological marvels is all around us\u2014discoveries in genetics and in the structure of particles, the wireless Internet, and other inventions almost too numerous to count. The **U.S. Patent and Trademark Office**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} typically has issued more than 150,000 patents annually in recent years.\n\nThis recipe for economic growth\u2014investing in labor productivity, with investments in human capital and technology, as well as increasing physical capital\u2014also applies to other economies. In South Korea, for example, universal enrollment in primary school (the equivalent of kindergarten through sixth grade in the United States) had already been achieved by 1965, when Korea\u2019s GDP per capita was still near its rock bottom low. By the late 1980s, Korea had achieved almost universal secondary school education (the equivalent of a high school education in the United States). With regard to physical capital, Korea\u2019s rates of investment had been about 15% of GDP at the start of the 1960s, but doubled to 30\u201335% of GDP by the late 1960s and early 1970s. With regard to technology, South Korean students went to universities and colleges around the world to get scientific and technical training, and South Korean firms reached out to study and form partnerships with firms that could offer them technological insights. These factors combined to foster South Korea\u2019s high rate of economic growth.\n\n### Growth Accounting Studies\n\nSince the late 1950s, economists have conducted growth accounting studies to determine the extent to which physical and human capital deepening and technology have contributed to growth. The usual approach uses an aggregate production function to estimate how much of per capita economic growth can be attributed to growth in physical capital and human capital. These two inputs can be measured, at least roughly. The part of growth that is unexplained by measured inputs, called the residual, is then attributed to growth in technology. The exact numerical estimates differ from study to study and from country to country, depending on how researchers measured these three main factors over what time horizons. For studies of the U.S. economy, three lessons commonly emerge from growth accounting studies.\n\nFirst, technology is typically the most important contributor to U.S. economic growth. Growth in human capital and physical capital often explains only half or less than half of the economic growth that occurs. New ways of doing things are tremendously important.\n\nSecond, while investment in physical capital is essential to growth in labor productivity and GDP per capita, building human capital is at least as important. Economic growth is not just a matter of more machines and buildings. One vivid example of the power of human capital and technological knowledge occurred in Europe in the years after World War II (1939\u20131945). During the war, a large share of Europe\u2019s physical capital, such as factories, roads, and vehicles, was destroyed. Europe also lost an overwhelming amount of human capital in the form of millions of men, women, and children who died during the war. However, the powerful combination of skilled workers and technological knowledge, working within a market-oriented economic framework, rebuilt Europe\u2019s productive capacity to an even higher level within less than two decades.\n\nA third lesson is that these three factors of human capital, physical capital, and technology work together. Workers with a higher level of education and skills are often better at coming up with new technological innovations. These technological innovations are often ideas that cannot increase production until they become a part of new investment in physical capital. New machines that embody technological innovations often require additional training, which builds worker skills further. If the recipe for economic growth is to succeed, an economy needs all the ingredients of the aggregate production function. See the following Clear It Up feature for an example of how human capital, physical capital, and technology can combine to significantly impact lives.\n\n\n\nHow do girls\u2019 education and economic growth relate in low-income countries?\n\nIn the early 2000s, according to the World Bank, about 110 million children between the ages of 6 and 11 were not in school\u2014and about two-thirds of them were girls. In Bangladesh, for example, the illiteracy rate for those aged 15 to 24 was 78% for females, compared to 75% for males. In Egypt, for this age group, illiteracy was 84% for females and 91% for males. Cambodia had 86% illiteracy for females and 88% for males. Nigeria had 66% illiteracy for females in the 15 to 24 age bracket and 78% for males.\n\nWhenever any child does not receive a basic education, it is both a human and an economic loss. In low-income countries, wages typically increase by an average of 10 to 20% with each additional year of education. There is, however, some intriguing evidence that helping girls in low-income countries to close the education gap with boys may be especially important, because of the social role that many of the girls will play as mothers and homemakers.\n\nGirls in low-income countries who receive more education tend to grow up to have fewer, healthier, better-educated children. Their children are more likely to be better nourished and to receive basic health care like immunizations. Economic research on women in low-income economies backs up these findings. When 20 women get one additional year of schooling, as a group they will, on average, have one less child. When 1,000 women get one additional year of schooling, on average one to two fewer women from that group will die in childbirth. When a woman stays in school an additional year, that factor alone means that, on average, each of her children will spend an additional half-year in school. Education for girls is a good investment because it is an investment in economic growth with benefits beyond the current generation.\n\n\n\n### A Healthy Climate for Economic Growth\n\nWhile physical and human capital deepening and better technology are important, equally important to a nation\u2019s well-being is the climate or system within which these inputs are cultivated. Both the type of market economy and a legal system that governs and sustains property rights and contractual rights are important contributors to a healthy economic climate.\n\nA healthy economic climate usually involves some sort of market orientation at the microeconomic, individual, or firm decision-making level. Markets that allow personal and business rewards and incentives for increasing human and physical capital encourage overall macroeconomic growth. For example, when workers participate in a competitive and well-functioning labor market, they have an incentive to acquire additional human capital, because additional education and skills will pay off in higher wages. Firms have an incentive to invest in physical capital and in training workers, because they expect to earn higher profits for their shareholders. Both individuals and firms look for new technologies, because even small inventions can make work easier or lead to product improvement. Collectively, such individual and business decisions made within a market structure add up to macroeconomic growth. Much of the rapid growth since the late nineteenth century has come from harnessing the power of competitive markets to allocate resources. This market orientation typically reaches beyond national borders and includes openness to international trade.\n\nA general orientation toward markets does not rule out important roles for government. There are times when markets fail to allocate capital or technology in a manner that provides the greatest benefit for society as a whole. The role of the government is to correct these failures. In addition, government can guide or influence markets toward certain outcomes. The following examples highlight some important areas that governments around the world have chosen to invest in to facilitate capital deepening and technology:\n\n* Education. The Danish government requires all children under 16 to attend school. They can choose to attend a public school (*Folkeskole*) or a private school. Students do not pay tuition to attend *Folkeskole*. Thirteen percent of primary/secondary (elementary/high) school is private, and the government supplies vouchers to citizens who choose private school.\n* Savings and Investment. In the United States, as in other countries, private investment is taxed. Low capital gains taxes encourage investment and so also economic growth.\n* Infrastructure. The Japanese government in the mid-1990s undertook significant infrastructure projects to improve roads and public works. This in turn increased the stock of physical capital and ultimately economic growth.\n* Special Economic Zones. The island of Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage international trade in government-supported **special economic zones (SEZ)**{: data-type=\"term\"}. These are areas of the country, usually with access to a port where, among other benefits, the government does not tax trade. As a result of its SEZ, Mauritius has enjoyed above-average economic growth since the 1980s. Free trade does not have to occur in an SEZ however. Governments can encourage international trade across the board, or surrender to protectionism.\n* Scientific Research. The European Union has strong programs to invest in scientific research. The researchers **Abraham Garc\u00eda**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **Pierre Mohnen**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} demonstrate that firms which received support from the Austrian government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales. Governments can support scientific research and technical training that helps to create and spread new technologies. Governments can also provide a legal environment that protects the ability of inventors to profit from their inventions.\n{: data-bullet-style=\"bullet\"}\n\nThere are many more ways in which the government can play an active role in promoting economic growth; we explore them in other chapters and in particular in [Macroeconomic Policy Around the World](/m48811){: .target-chapter}. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per capita and labor productivity includes human capital deepening, physical capital deepening, and technological gains, operating in a market-oriented economy with supportive government policies.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nOver decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. Capital deepening refers to an increase in the amount of capital per worker, either human capital per worker, in the form of higher education or skills, or physical capital per worker. Technology, in its economic meaning, refers broadly to all new methods of production, which includes major scientific inventions but also small inventions and even better forms of management or other types of institutions. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per capita consists of improvements in human capital, physical capital, and technology, in a market-oriented environment with supportive public policies and institutions.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhat do the growth accounting studies conclude are the determinants of growth? Which is more important, the determinants or how they are combined?\n\n\n\nCapital deepening and technology are important. What seems to be more important is how they are combined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat policies can the government of a free-market economy implement to stimulate economic growth?\n\n\n\nGovernment can contribute to economic growth by investing in human capital through the education system, building a strong physical infrastructure for transportation and commerce, increasing investment by lowering capital gains taxes, creating special economic zones that allow for reduced tariffs, and investing in research and development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList the areas where government policy can help economic growth.\n\n\n\nPublic education, low investment taxes, funding for infrastructure projects, special economic zones\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is an aggregate production function?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is capital deepening?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do economists mean when they refer to improvements in technology?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nEducation seems to be important for human capital deepening. As people become better educated and more knowledgeable, are there limits to how much additional benefit more education can provide? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe some of the political and social tradeoffs that might occur when a less developed country adopts a strategy to promote labor force participation and economic growth via investment in girls\u2019 education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is investing in girls\u2019 education beneficial for growth?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the concept of technology, as defined with the aggregate production function, different from our everyday use of the word?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\n\u201cWomen and the World Economy: A Guide to Womenomics.\u201d *The Economist*, April 12, 2006. http://www.economist.com/node/6802551.\n\nFarole, Thomas, and Gokhan Akinci, eds. *Special Economic Zones: Progress, Emerging Challenges, and Future Directions*.

The low-income countries have GDP growth that is faster than that of the middle-income countries, which in turn have GDP growth that is faster than that of the high-income countries. Two prominent members of the fast-growth club are China and India, which between them have nearly 40% of the world\u2019s population. Some prominent members of the slow-growth club are high-income countries like the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan.\n\nWill this pattern of economic convergence persist into the future? This is a controversial question among economists that we will consider by looking at some of the main arguments on both sides.\n\n### Arguments Favoring Convergence\n\nSeveral arguments suggest that low-income countries might have an advantage in achieving greater worker productivity and economic growth in the future.\n\nA first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns. Even though deepening human and physical capital will tend to increase GDP per capita, the **law of diminishing returns**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital, the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish. For example, raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth-grade level to a high school diploma (while holding all other inputs constant) would produce a certain increase in output. An additional two-year increase, so that the average person had a two-year college degree, would increase output further, but the marginal gain would be smaller. Yet another additional two-year increase in the level of education, so that the average person would have a four-year-college bachelor\u2019s degree, would increase output still further, but the marginal increase would again be smaller. A similar lesson holds for physical capital. If the quantity of physical capital available to the average worker increases, by, say, $5,000 to $10,000 (again, while holding all other inputs constant), it will increase the level of output. An additional increase from $10,000 to $15,000 will increase output further, but the marginal increase will be smaller.\n\nLow-income countries like China and India tend to have lower levels of human capital and physical capital, so an investment in capital deepening should have a larger marginal effect in these countries than in high-income countries, where levels of human and physical capital are already relatively high. Diminishing returns implies that low-income economies could converge to the levels achieved by the high-income countries.\n\nA second argument is that low-income countries may find it easier to improve their technologies than high-income countries. High-income countries must continually invent new technologies, whereas low-income countries can often find ways of applying technology that has already been invented and is well understood. The economist **Alexander Gerschenkron**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (1904\u20131978) gave this phenomenon a memorable name: \u201cthe advantages of backwardness.\u201d Of course, he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower standard of living. He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up.\n\nFinally, optimists argue that many countries have observed the experience of those that have grown more quickly and have learned from it. Moreover, once the people of a country begin to enjoy the benefits of a higher standard of living, they may be more likely to build and support the market-friendly institutions that will help provide this standard of living.\n\n\nView this [video][1] to learn about economic growth across the world.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Arguments That Convergence Is neither Inevitable nor Likely\n\nIf the growth of an economy depended only on the deepening of human capital and physical capital, then the growth rate of that economy would be expected to slow down over the long run because of diminishing marginal returns. However, there is another crucial factor in the aggregate production function: technology.\n\nThe development of new technology can provide a way for an economy to sidestep the diminishing marginal returns of capital deepening. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C20_006) shows how. The horizontal axis of the figure measures the amount of capital deepening, which on this figure is an overall measure that includes deepening of both physical and human capital. The amount of human and physical capital per worker increases as you move from left to right, from C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>3</sub>. The vertical axis of the diagram measures per capita output. Start by considering the lowest line in this diagram, labeled Technology 1. Along this aggregate production function, the level of technology is being held constant, so the line shows only the relationship between capital deepening and output. As capital deepens from C<sub>1</sub> to C<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>3</sub> and the economy moves from R to U to W, per capita output does increase\u2014but the way in which the line starts out steeper on the left but then flattens as it moves to the right shows the diminishing marginal returns, as additional marginal amounts of capital deepening increase output by ever-smaller amounts. The shape of the aggregate production line (Technology 1) shows that the ability of capital deepening, by itself, to generate sustained economic growth is limited, since diminishing returns will eventually set in.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C20_006 data-title=\"Capital Deepening and New Technology \"}\n\nNow, bring improvements in technology into the picture. Improved technology means that with a given set of inputs, more output is possible. The production function labeled Technology 1 in the figure is based on one level of technology, but Technology 2 is based on an improved level of technology, so for every level of capital deepening on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis. In turn, production function Technology 3 represents a still higher level of technology, so that for every level of inputs on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis than either of the other two aggregate production functions.\n\nMost healthy, growing economies are deepening their human and physical capital and increasing technology at the same time. As a result, the economy can move from a choice like point R on the Technology 1 aggregate production line to a point like S on Technology 2 and a point like T on the still higher aggregate production line (Technology 3). With the combination of technology and capital deepening, the rise in GDP per capita in high-income countries does not need to fade away because of diminishing returns. The gains from technology can offset the diminishing returns involved with capital deepening.\n\nWill technological improvements themselves run into diminishing returns over time? That is, will it become continually harder and more costly to discover new technological improvements? Perhaps someday, but, at least over the last two centuries since the Industrial Revolution, improvements in technology have not run into diminishing marginal returns. Modern inventions, like the Internet or discoveries in genetics or materials science, do not seem to provide smaller gains to output than earlier inventions like the steam engine or the railroad. One reason that technological ideas do not seem to run into diminishing returns is that the ideas of new technology can often be widely applied at a marginal cost that is very low or even zero. A specific additional machine, or an additional year of education, must be used by a specific worker or group of workers. A new technology or invention can be used by many workers across the economy at very low marginal cost.\n\nThe argument that it is easier for a low-income country to copy and adapt existing technology than it is for a high-income country to invent new technology is not necessarily true, either. When it comes to adapting and using new technology, a society\u2019s performance is not necessarily guaranteed, but is the result of whether the economic, educational, and public policy institutions of the country are supportive. In theory, perhaps, low-income countries have many opportunities to copy and adapt technology, but if they lack the appropriate supportive economic infrastructure and institutions, the theoretical possibility that backwardness might have certain advantages is of little practical relevance.\n\n\nVisit this [website][2] to read more about economic growth in India.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### The Slowness of Convergence\n\nAlthough economic convergence between the high-income countries and the rest of the world seems possible and even likely, it will proceed slowly. Consider, for example, a country that starts off with a GDP per capita of $40,000, which would roughly represent a typical high-income country today, and another country that starts out at $4,000, which is roughly the level in low-income but not impoverished countries like Indonesia, Guatemala, or Egypt. Say that the rich country chugs along at a 2% annual growth rate of GDP per capita, while the poorer country grows at the aggressive rate of 7% per year. After 30 years, GDP per capita in the rich country will be $72,450 (that is, $40,000 (1 + 0.02)<sup>30</sup>) while in the poor country it will be $30,450 (that is, $4,000 (1 + 0.07)<sup>30</sup>). Convergence has occurred; the rich country used to be 10 times as wealthy as the poor one, and now it is only about 2.4 times as wealthy. Even after 30 consecutive years of very rapid growth, however, people in the low-income country are still likely to feel quite poor compared to people in the rich country. Moreover, as the poor country catches up, its opportunities for catch-up growth are reduced, and its growth rate may slow down somewhat.\n\nThe slowness of convergence illustrates again that small differences in annual rates of economic growth become huge differences over time. The high-income countries have been building up their advantage in standard of living over decades\u2014more than a century in some cases. Even in an optimistic scenario, it will take decades for the low-income countries of the world to catch up significantly.\n\n\n\nCalories and Economic Growth\n\nThe story of modern economic growth can be told by looking at calorie consumption over time. The dramatic rise in incomes allowed the average person to eat better and consume more calories. How did these incomes increase? The neoclassical growth consensus uses the **aggregate production function**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital. Also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth and convergence. The issue of distribution of income notwithstanding, it is clear that the average worker can afford more calories in 2014 than in 1875.\n\nAside from increases in income, there is another reason why the average person can afford more food. Modern agriculture has allowed many countries to produce more food than they need. Despite having more than enough food, however, many governments and multilateral agencies have not solved the food distribution problem. In fact, food shortages, famine, or general food insecurity are caused more often by the failure of government macroeconomic policy, according to the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. Sen has conducted extensive research into issues of inequality, poverty, and the role of government in improving standards of living. Macroeconomic policies that strive toward stable inflation, full employment, education of women, and preservation of property rights are more likely to eliminate starvation and provide for a more even distribution of food.\n\nBecause we have more food per capita, global food prices have decreased since 1875. The prices of some foods, however, have decreased more than the prices of others. For example, researchers from the University of Washington have shown that in the United States, calories from zucchini and lettuce are 100 times more expensive than calories from oil, butter, and sugar. Research from countries like India, China, and the United States suggests that as incomes rise, individuals want more calories from fats and protein and fewer from carbohydrates. This has very interesting implications for global food production, obesity, and environmental consequences. Affluent urban India has an obesity problem much like many parts of the United States. The forces of convergence are at work.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nWhen countries with lower levels of GDP per capita catch up to countries with higher levels of GDP per capita, the process is called convergence. Convergence can occur even when both high- and low-income countries increase investment in physical and human capital with the objective of growing GDP. This is because the impact of new investment in physical and human capital on a low-income country may result in huge gains as new skills or equipment are combined with the labor force. In higher-income countries, however, a level of investment equal to that of the low income country is not likely to have as big an impact, because the more developed country most likely has high levels of capital investment. Therefore, the marginal gain from this additional investment tends to be successively less and less. Higher income countries are more likely to have diminishing returns to their investments and must continually invent new technologies; this allows lower-income economies to have a chance for convergent growth. However, many high-income economies have developed economic and political institutions that provide a healthy economic climate for an ongoing stream of technological innovations. Continuous technological innovation can counterbalance diminishing returns to investments in human and physical capital.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nUse an example to explain why, after periods of rapid growth, a low-income country that has not caught up to a high-income country may feel poor.\n\n\n\nA good way to think about this is how a runner who has fallen behind in a race feels psychologically and physically as he catches up. Playing catch-up can be more taxing than maintaining one\u2019s position at the head of the pack.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould the following events usually lead to capital deepening? Why or why not?\n\n1.  A weak economy in which businesses become reluctant to make long-term investments in physical capital.\n2.  A rise in international trade.\n3.  A trend in which many more adults participate in continuing education courses through their employers and at colleges and universities.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  No. Capital deepening refers to an increase in the amount of capital per person in an economy. A decrease in investment by firms will actually cause the opposite of capital deepening (since the population will grow over time).\n2.  There is no direct connection between and increase in international trade and capital deepening. One could imagine particular scenarios where trade could lead to capital deepening (for example, if international capital inflows which are the counterpart to increasing the trade deficit) lead to an increase in physical capital investment), but in general, no.\n3.  Yes. Capital deepening refers to an increase in either physical capital or human capital per person. Continuing education or any time of lifelong learning adds to human capital and thus creates capital deepening.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the \u201cadvantages of backwardness\u201d for economic growth?\n\n\n\nThe advantages of backwardness include faster growth rates because of the process of convergence, as well as the ability to adopt new technologies that were developed first in the \u201cleader\u201d countries. While being \u201cbackward\u201d is not inherently a good thing, Gerschenkron stressed that there are certain advantages which aid countries trying to \u201ccatch up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you expect capital deepening to result in diminished returns? Why or why not? Would you expect improvements in technology to result in diminished returns? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nCapital deepening, by definition, should lead to diminished returns because you're investing more and more but using the same methods of production, leading to the marginal productivity declining. This is shown on a production function as a movement along the curve. Improvements in technology should not lead to diminished returns because you are finding new and more efficient ways of using the same amount of capital. This can be illustrated as a shift upward of the production function curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does productivity growth in high-income economies not slow down as it runs into diminishing returns from additional investments in physical capital and human capital? Does this show one area where the theory of diminishing returns fails to apply? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nProductivity growth from new advances in technology will not slow because the new methods of production will be adopted relatively quickly and easily, at very low marginal cost. Also, countries that are seeing technology growth usually have a vast and powerful set of institutions for training workers and building better machines, which allows the maximum amount of people to benefit from the new technology. These factors have the added effect of making additional technological advances even easier for these countries.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nFor a high-income economy like the United States, what elements of the aggregate production function are most important in bringing about growth in GDP per capita? What about a middle-income country such as Brazil? A low-income country such as Niger?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList some arguments for and against the likelihood of convergence.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhat sorts of policies can governments implement to encourage convergence?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs technological change makes us more sedentary and food costs increase, obesity is likely. What factors do you think may limit obesity?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency. \u201cThe World Factbook: Country Comparison: GDP\u2013Real Growth Rate.\u201d https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2003rank.html.\n\nSen, Amartya. \u201cHunger in the Contemporary World (Discussion Paper DEDPS/8).\u201d *The Suntory Centre: London School of Economics and Political Science*.

That is a huge number of positions gone. During the tepid recovery, some positions were added, but as of summer 2013, unemployment had remained persistently higher than the pre-recession rate of less than 5%. Some economists and policymakers worried the recovery would be \u201cjobless.\u201d With the economy growing, albeit slowly, why wasn\u2019t the unemployment number falling? Why were firms not hiring?\n\nPeter Cappelli, noted Wharton management professor and Director of Wharton\u2019s Center for Human Resources, does not believe the job search process is akin to what he terms the \u201cHome Depot\u201d view of hiring. According to him, this view \u201cbasically says that filling a job is like replacing a part in a washing machine. You simply find someone who does the exact same job as that broken part, plug him or her into the washing machine and that is it.\u201d The job search, for both the prospective employee and the employer, is more complex than that.\n\nIn a hiring situation, employers hold all the cards. They write the job descriptions, determine the salaries, decide when and how to advertise positions, and set the controls on employment application screening software. Advertising for positions has increased as the economic recovery progresses, yet here\u2019s the kicker: Employers say there are no applicants out there who meet their needs. While the unemployment rate is now below 6% as of the beginning of 2015, many economists and policymakers (including the Chair of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen) are still concerned about \\\"slack\\\" in the labor market. So the question arises: where are the job candidates?\n\nThat question leads us to the topic of this chapter\u2014unemployment. What constitutes it? How is it measured? And if the economy is growing, why isn\u2019t the pool of job openings growing along with it? Sounds like the economy has a case of \u201cmissing\u201d candidates.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Unemployment\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* How the Unemployment Rate is Defined and Computed\n* Patterns of Unemployment\n* What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run\n* What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run\n\n\n\nUnemployment can be a terrible and wrenching life experience\u2014like a serious automobile accident or a messy divorce\u2014whose consequences can be fully understood only by someone who has gone through it. For unemployed individuals and their families, there is the day-to-day financial stress of not knowing where the next paycheck is coming from. There are painful adjustments, like watching your savings account dwindle, selling a car and buying a cheaper one, or moving to a less expensive place to live. Even when the unemployed person finds a new job, it may pay less than the previous one. For many people, their job is an important part of their self worth. When unemployment separates people from the workforce, it can affect family relationships as well as mental and physical health.\n\nThe human costs of unemployment alone would justify making a low level of unemployment an important public policy priority. But unemployment also includes economic costs to the broader society. When millions of unemployed but willing workers cannot find jobs, an economic resource is going unused. An economy with high unemployment is like a company operating with a functional but unused factory. The **opportunity cost**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of unemployment is the output that could have been produced by the unemployed workers.\n\nThis chapter will discuss how the unemployment rate is defined and computed. It will examine the patterns of unemployment over time, for the U.S. economy as a whole, for different demographic groups in the U.S. economy, and for other countries. It will then consider an economic explanation for unemployment, and how it explains the patterns of unemployment and suggests public policies for reducing it.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

A recent report might have said, for example, *from August 2009 to November 2009, the U.S. unemployment rate rose from 9.7% to 10.0%, but by June 2010, it had fallen to 9.5%*. At a glance, the changes between the percentages may seem small. But remember that the U.S. economy has about 155 million adults who either have jobs or are looking for them. A rise or fall of just 0.1% in the unemployment rate of 155 million potential workers translates into 155,000 people, which is roughly the total population of a city like Syracuse, New York, Brownsville, Texas, or Pasadena, California. Large rises in the unemployment rate mean large numbers of job losses. In November 2009, at the peak of the recession, about 15 million people were out of work. Even with the unemployment rate now at 5.5% as of February 2015, about 8 million people total are out of work.\n\n\nThe [Bureau of Labor Statistics][1] tracks and reports all data related to unemployment.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Who\u2019s In or Out of the Labor Force?\n\nShould everyone without a job be counted as unemployed? Of course not. Children, for example, should not be counted as unemployed. Surely, the retired should not be counted as unemployed. Many full-time college students have only a part-time job, or no job at all, but it seems inappropriate to count them as suffering the pains of unemployment. Some people are not working because they are rearing children, ill, on vacation, or on parental leave.\n\nThe point is that the adult population is not just divided into employed and unemployed. A third group exists: people who do not have a job, and for some reason\u2014retirement, looking after children, taking a voluntary break before a new job\u2014are not interested in having a job, either. It also includes those who do want a job but have quit looking, often due to being discouraged by their inability to find suitable employment. Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as **out of the labor force**{: data-type=\"term\"} or not in the labor force.\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate, which is based on a monthly survey carried out by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, asks a series of questions to divide up the adult population into employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force. To be classified as unemployed, a person must be without a job, currently available to work, and actively looking for work in the previous four weeks. Thus, a person who does not have a job but who is not currently available to work or has not actively looked for work in the last four weeks is counted as out of the labor force.\n\n**Employed**\\: currently working for pay\n\n**Unemployed**\\: Out of work and actively looking for a job\n\n**Out of the labor force**\\: Out of paid work and not actively looking for a job\n\n**Labor force**\\: the number of employed plus the unemployed\n\n### Calculating the Unemployment Rate\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_001) shows the three-way division of the over-16 adult population. In February 2015, about 62.8% of the adult population was \\\"in the labor force\\\"; that is, people are either employed or without a job but looking for work. Those in the labor force can be divided into the employed and the unemployed. These values are also shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_21_01). The **unemployment rate**{: data-type=\"term\"} is not the percentage of the total adult population without jobs, but rather the percentage of adults who are in the labor force but who do not have jobs:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Unemployment\u00a0rate</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>Unemployed\u00a0people</mtext><mtext>Total\u00a0labor\u00a0force</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable><mo>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0</mo><mn>100</mn></math>\n\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C21_001 data-title=\"Employed, Unemployed, and Out of the Labor Force Distribution of Adult Population (age 16 and older), February 2015\"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_21_01\" summary=\"Under the first unlabeled column are the values: Total adult population over the age of 16; In the labor force; Employed; Unemployed; and Out of the labor force.

The following Work It Out feature will walk you through the steps of this calculation.\n\n\n\nCalculating Labor Force Percentages\n\nSo how do economists arrive at the percentages in and out of the labor force and the unemployment rate? We will use the values in [\\[link\\]](#Table_21_01) to illustrate the steps.\n\nTo determine the percentage in the labor force:\n\nStep 1. Divide the number of people in the labor force (157 million) by the total adult (working-age) population (249.9 million).\n\nStep 2. Multiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Percentage\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0labor\u00a0force</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mrow><mn>157</mn></mrow><mrow><mn>249.9</mn></mrow></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>0.6282</mn></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>62.8%</mn></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nTo determine the percentage out of the labor force:\n\nStep 1.

There are some people who have only part time or temporary jobs and who are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as employed, though they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be. Additionally, there are individuals who are **underemployed**{: data-type=\"term\"}. This includes those that are trained or skilled for one type or level of work who are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills. For example, an individual with a college degree in finance who is working as a sales clerk would be considered underemployed. They are, however, also counted in the employed group. All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term \u201c**hidden unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\u201d **Discouraged workers**{: data-type=\"term\"}, those who have stopped looking for employment and, hence, are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group\n\n### Labor Force Participation Rate\n\nAnother important statistic is the **labor force participation rate**{: data-type=\"term\"}. This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job. So, using the data in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_001) and [\\[link\\]](#Table_21_01), those included in this calculation would be the 157 million individuals in the labor force. The rate is calculated by taking the number of people in the labor force, that is, the number employed and the number unemployed, divided by the total adult population and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. For the data from February 2015, the labor force participation rate is 62.8%. Historically, the civilian labor force participation rate in the United States climbed beginning in the 1960s as women increasingly entered the workforce, and it peaked at around 68% in late 1999 to early 2000. Since then, the labor force participation rate has steadily declined.\n\n### The Establishment Payroll Survey\n\nWhen the unemployment report comes out each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also reports on the number of jobs created\u2014which comes from the establishment payroll survey. The payroll survey is based on a survey of about 140,000 businesses and government agencies throughout the United States. It generates payroll employment estimates by the following criteria: all employees, average weekly hours worked, and average hourly, weekly, and overtime earnings. One of the criticisms of this survey is that it does not count the self-employed. It also does not make a distinction between new, minimum wage, part time or temporary jobs and full time jobs with \u201cdecent\u201d pay.\n\n### How Is the U.S. Unemployment Data Collected?\n\nThe unemployment rate announced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics each month is based on the Current Population Survey (CPS), which has been carried out every month since 1940. Great care is taken to make this survey representative of the country as a whole. The country is first divided into 3,137 areas. The U.S. Bureau of the Census then selects 729 of these areas to survey. The 729 areas are then divided into districts of about 300 households each, and each district is divided into clusters of about four dwelling units. Every month, Census Bureau employees call about 15,000 of the four-household clusters, for a total of 60,000 households. Households are interviewed for four consecutive months, then rotated out of the survey for eight months, and then interviewed again for the same four months the following year, before leaving the sample permanently.\n\nBased on this survey, unemployment rates are calculated by state, industry, urban and rural areas, gender, age, race or ethnicity, and level of education. A wide variety of other information is available, too. For example, how long have people been unemployed? Did they become unemployed because they quit, or were laid off, or their employer went out of business? Is the unemployed person the only wage earner in the family? The Current Population Survey is a treasure trove of information about employment and unemployment. If you are wondering what the difference is between the CPS and EPS, read the following Clear it Up feature.\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between CPS and EPS?\n\nThe Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the United States Census Bureau measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The establishment payroll survey (EPS) by the Bureau of Labor Statistics is a payroll survey that measures the net change in jobs created for the month.\n\n\n\n### Criticisms of Measuring Unemployment\n\nThere are always complications in measuring the number of unemployed. For example, what about people who do not have jobs and would be available to work, but have gotten discouraged at the lack of available jobs in their area and stopped looking? Such people, and their families, may be suffering the pains of unemployment. But the survey counts them as out of the labor force because they are not actively looking for work. Other people may tell the Census Bureau that they are ready to work and looking for a job but, truly, they are not that eager to work and are not looking very hard at all. They are counted as unemployed, although they might more accurately be classified as out of the labor force. Still other people may have a job, perhaps doing something like yard work, child care, or cleaning houses, but are not reporting the income earned to the tax authorities. They may report being unemployed, when they actually are working.\n\nAlthough the unemployment rate gets most of the public and media attention, economic researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics publish a wide array of surveys and reports that try to measure these kinds of issues and to develop a more nuanced and complete view of the labor market. It is not exactly a hot news flash that economic statistics are imperfect. Even imperfect measures like the unemployment rate, however, can still be quite informative, when interpreted knowledgeably and sensibly.\n\n\nClick [here][2] to learn more about the CPS to read frequently asked questions about employment and labor.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nUnemployment imposes high costs. Unemployed individuals suffer from loss of income and from stress. An economy with high unemployment suffers an opportunity cost of unused resources. The adult population can be divided into those in the labor force and those out of the labor force. In turn, those in the labor force are divided into employed and unemployed. A person without a job must be willing and able to work and actively looking for work to be counted as unemployed; otherwise, a person without a job is counted as being out of the labor force. The unemployment rate is defined as the number of unemployed persons divided by the number of persons in the labor force (not the overall adult population). The Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the United States Census Bureau measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The establishment payroll survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures the net change in jobs created for the month.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nSuppose the adult population over the age of 16 is 237.8 million and the labor force is 153.9 million (of whom 139.1 million are employed). How many people are \u201cnot in the labor force?\u201d What are the proportions of employed, unemployed and not in the labor force in the population? *Hint*: Proportions are percentages.\n\n\n\nThe population is divided into those \u201cin the labor force\u201d and those \u201cnot in the labor force.\u201d Thus, the number of adults not in the labor force is 237.8 \u2013 153.9 = 83.9 million. Since the labor force is divided into employed persons and unemployed persons, the number of unemployed persons is 153.9 \u2013 139.1 = 14.8 million. Thus, the adult population has the following proportions:\n\n* 139\\.1/237.8 = 58.5% employed persons\n* 14\\.8/237.8 = 6.2% unemployed persons\n* 83\\.9/237.8 = 35.3% persons out of the labor force\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the above data, what is the unemployment rate? These data are U.S. statistics from 2010. How does it compare to the February 2015 unemployment rate computed earlier?\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate is defined as the number of unemployed persons as a percentage of the labor force or 14.8/153.9 = 9.6%. This is higher than the February 2015 unemployment rate, computed earlier, of 5.5%.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between being unemployed and being out of the labor force?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the unemployment rate calculated?

Unemployment rates do fluctuate over time. During the deep recessions of the early 1980s and of 2007\u20132009, unemployment reached roughly 10%. For comparison, during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the unemployment rate reached almost 25% of the labor force.\n2.  Unemployment rates in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s were rather low by historical standards. The unemployment rate was below 5% from 1997 to 2000 and near 5% during almost all of 2006\u20132007. The previous time unemployment had been less than 5% for three consecutive years was three decades earlier, from 1968 to 1970.\n3.  The unemployment rate never falls all the way to zero. Indeed, it never seems to get below 3%\u2014and it stays that low only for very short periods. (Reasons why this is the case are discussed later in this chapter.)\n4.  The timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy. During periods of **recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **depression**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, unemployment is high. During periods of economic growth, unemployment tends to be lower.\n5.  No significant upward or downward trend in unemployment rates is apparent. This point is especially worth noting because the U.S. population nearly quadrupled from 76 million in 1900 to over 314 million by 2012. Moreover, a higher proportion of U.S. adults are now in the paid workforce, because women have entered the paid labor force in significant numbers in recent decades. Women composed 18% of the paid workforce in 1900 and nearly half of the paid workforce in 2012. But despite the increased number of workers, as well as other economic events like globalization and the continuous invention of new technologies, the economy has provided jobs without causing any long-term upward or downward trend in unemployment rates.\n{: type=\"1\"}\n\n### Unemployment Rates by Group\n\nUnemployment is not distributed evenly across the U.S. population. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_011) shows unemployment rates broken down in various ways: by gender, age, and race/ethnicity.\n\n  By gender, 1972&#x2013;2014. Unemployment rates for men used to be lower than unemployment rates for women, but in recent decades, the two rates have been very close, often with the unemployment rate for men somewhat higher. (b) By age, 1972&#x2013;2014. Unemployment rates are highest for the very young and become lower with age. (c) By race and ethnicity, 1972&#x2013;2014. Although unemployment rates for all groups tend to rise and fall together, the unemployment rate for whites has been lower than the unemployment rate for blacks and Hispanics in recent decades. (Source: www.bls.gov)\"){: #CNX_Econ_C21_011 data-title=\"Unemployment Rate by Demographic Group \"}\n\nThe unemployment rate for women had historically tended to be higher than the unemployment rate for men, perhaps reflecting the historical pattern that women were seen as \u201csecondary\u201d earners. By about 1980, however, the unemployment rate for women was essentially the same as that for men, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_011) (a). During the recession of 2008-2009, the unemployment rate for men exceeded the unemployment rate for women. Through 2014, this pattern has remained, although the gap is narrowing.\n\n\nRead this [report][1] for detailed information on the recession of 2008\u20132009. It also provides some very useful information on the statistics of unemployment.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nYounger workers tend to have higher unemployment, while middle-aged workers tend to have lower unemployment, probably because the middle-aged workers feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Younger workers move in and out of jobs (and in and out of the labor force) more easily. Elderly workers have extremely low rates of unemployment, because those who do not have jobs often exit the labor force by retiring, and thus are not counted in the unemployment statistics. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_011) (b) shows unemployment rates for women divided by age; the pattern for men is similar.\n\nThe unemployment rate for African-Americans is substantially higher than the rate for other racial or ethnic groups, a fact that surely reflects, to some extent, a pattern of discrimination that has constrained blacks\u2019 labor market opportunities. However, the gaps between unemployment rates for whites and for blacks and Hispanics diminished in the 1990s, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_011) (c). In fact, unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics were at the lowest levels for several decades in the mid-2000s before rising during the recent Great Recession.\n\nFinally, those with less education typically suffer higher unemployment. In February 2015, for example, the unemployment rate for those with a college degree was 2.7%; for those with some college but not a four year degree, the unemployment rate was 5.1%; for high school graduates with no additional degree, the unemployment rate was 5.4%; and for those without a high school diploma, the unemployment rate was 8.4%. This pattern may arise because additional education offers better connections to the labor market and higher demand, or it may occur because the labor market opportunities for low-skilled workers are less attractive than the opportunities for the more highly-skilled. Because of lower pay, low-skilled workers may be less motivated to find jobs.\n\n### Breaking Down Unemployment in Other Ways\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics also gives information about the reasons for being unemployed as well as the length of time individuals have been unemployed. [\\[link\\]](#Table_21_02), for example, shows the four reasons for being unemployed and the percentages of the currently unemployed that fall into each category.

For example, Japan\u2019s unemployment rates appear quite low, but Japan\u2019s economy has been mired in slow growth and recession since the late 1980s, and Japan\u2019s unemployment rate probably paints too rosy a picture of its labor market. In Japan, workers who lose their jobs are often quick to exit the labor force and not look for a new job, in which case they are not counted as unemployed. In addition, Japanese firms are often quite reluctant to fire workers, and so firms have substantial numbers of workers who are on reduced hours or officially employed, but doing very little. This Japanese pattern is perhaps best viewed as an unusual method for society to provide support for the unemployed, rather than a sign of a healthy economy.\n\n\nWe hear about the Chinese economy in the news all the time. The value of the Chinese yuan in comparison to the U.S. dollar is likely to be part of the nightly business report. So why is the Chinese economy not included in this discussion of international unemployment? The lack of reliable statistics is probably the reason. This [article][3] explains why.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nComparing unemployment rates in the United States and other high-income economies with unemployment rates in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia is very difficult. One reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. But a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many **low-income countries**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly. Instead, workers in these countries are engaged in short-term work, subsistence activities, and barter. Moreover, the effect of unemployment is very different in high-income and low-income countries. Unemployed workers in the developed economies have access to various government programs like unemployment insurance, welfare, and food stamps; such programs may barely exist in poorer countries. Although unemployment is a serious problem in many low-income countries, it manifests itself in a different way than in high-income countries.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate rises during periods of recession and depression, but falls back to the range of 4% to 6% when the economy is strong. The unemployment rate never falls to zero. Despite enormous growth in the size of the U.S. population and labor force in the twentieth century, along with other major trends like globalization and new technology, the unemployment rate shows no long-term rising trend.\n\nUnemployment rates differ by group: higher for African-Americans and Hispanics than for whites; higher for less educated than more educated; higher for the young than the middle-aged. Women\u2019s unemployment rates used to be higher than men\u2019s, but in recent years men\u2019s and women\u2019s unemployment rates have been very similar. In recent years, unemployment rates in the United States have compared favorably with unemployment rates in most other high-income economies.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nOver the long term, has the U.S. unemployment rate generally trended up, trended down, or remained at basically the same level?\n\n\n\nOver the long term, the U.S. unemployment rate has remained basically the same level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhose unemployment rates are commonly higher in the U.S. economy:\n\n1.  Whites or nonwhites?\n2.  The young or the middle-aged?\n3.  College graduates or high school graduates?\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  Nonwhites\n2.  The young\n3.

What could be some other reasons for the higher unemployment rate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile unemployment is highly negatively correlated with the level of economic activity, in the real world it responds with a lag. In other words, firms do not immediately lay off workers in response to a sales decline. They wait a while before responding. Similarly, firms do not immediately hire workers when sales pick up. What do you think accounts for the lag in response time?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think that unemployment rates are lower for individuals with more education?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/BLS_recession\n[2]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/droids\n[3]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ChinaEmployment", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48722", "module_title": "Economics - m48722", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48722", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Analyze cyclical unemployment\n* Explain the relationship between sticky wages and employment using various economic arguments\n* Apply supply and demand models to unemployment and wages\n\n\n\nWe have seen that unemployment varies across times and places. What causes changes in unemployment? There are different answers in the short run and in the long run. Let\\'s look at the short run first.\n\n### Cyclical Unemployment\n\nLet\u2019s make the plausible assumption that in the short run, from a few months to a few years, the quantity of hours that the average person is willing to work for a given wage does not change much, so the labor supply curve does not shift much. In addition, make the standard *ceteris paribus* assumption that there is no substantial short-term change in the age structure of the labor force, institutions and laws affecting the labor market, or other possibly relevant factors.\n\nOne primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the **macro economy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. If firms believe that business is expanding, then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater quantity of labor, and the labor demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, if firms perceive that the economy is slowing down or entering a recession, then they will wish to hire a lower quantity of labor at any given wage, and the labor demand curve will shift to the left. The variation in unemployment caused by the economy moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion (i.e. the business cycle) is known as **cyclical unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nFrom the standpoint of the supply-and-demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets, unemployment represents something of a puzzle. In a supply-and-demand model of a labor market, as illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_006), the **labor market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity. At the equilibrium wage (We), the equilibrium quantity (Qe) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers.\n\n  equals the number of jobs available (shown by D).\"){: #CNX_Econ_C21_006 data-title=\"The Unemployment and Equilibrium in the Labor Market \"}\n\nOne possibility for unemployment is that people who are unemployed are those who are not willing to work at the current equilibrium wage, say $10 an hour, but would be willing to work at a higher wage, like $20 per hour. The monthly Current Population Survey would count these people as unemployed, because they say they are ready and looking for work (at $20 per hour). But from an economist\u2019s point of view, these people are choosing to be unemployed.\n\nProbably a few people are unemployed because of unrealistic expectations about wages, but they do not represent the majority of the unemployed. Instead, unemployed people often have friends or acquaintances of similar skill levels who are employed, and the unemployed would be willing to work at the jobs and wages similar to what is being received by those people. But the employers of their friends and acquaintances do not seem to be hiring. In other words, these people are involuntarily unemployed. What causes **involuntary unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}?\n\n### Why Wages Might Be Sticky Downward\n\nIf a labor market model with flexible wages does not describe unemployment very well\u2014because it predicts that anyone willing to work at the going wage can always find a job\u2014then it may prove useful to consider economic models in which wages are not flexible or adjust only very slowly. In particular, even though wage increases may occur with relative ease, wage decreases are few and far between.\n\nOne set of reasons why wages may be \u201csticky downward,\u201d as economists put it, involves economic laws and institutions. For low-skilled workers being paid the **minimum wage**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, it is illegal to reduce their wages. For union workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company, wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor dispute or a strike. However, minimum wages and union contracts are not a sufficient reason why wages would be sticky downward for the U.S. economy as a whole. After all, out of the 150 million or so workers in the U.S. economy, only about 1.4 million\u2014less than 2% of the total\u2014are paid the minimum wage. Similarly, only about 12% of American wage and salary workers are represented by a labor union. In other high-income countries, more workers may have their wages determined by unions or the minimum wage may be set at a level that applies to a larger share of workers. But for the United States, these two factors combined affect only about one-fifth or less of the labor force.\n\nEconomists looking for reasons why wages might be **sticky**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} downwards have focused on factors that may characterize most labor relationships in the economy, not just a few. A number of different theories have been proposed, but they share a common tone.\n\nOne argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an **implicit contract**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble, and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is strong. This wage-setting behavior acts like a form of insurance: the employee has some protection against wage declines in bad times, but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times. Clearly, this sort of implicit contract means that firms will be hesitant to cut wages, lest workers feel betrayed and work less hard or even leave the firm.\n\n**Efficiency wage theory**{: data-type=\"term\"} argues that the productivity of workers depends on their pay, and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate. One reason is that employees who are paid better than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs, they would suffer a decline in salary. As a result, they are motivated to work harder and to stay with the current employer. In addition, employers know that it is costly and time-consuming to hire and train new employees, so they would prefer to pay workers a little extra now rather than to lose them and have to hire and train new workers. Thus, by avoiding wage cuts, the employer minimizes costs of training and hiring new workers, and reaps the benefits of well-motivated employees.\n\nThe **adverse selection of wage cuts argument**{: data-type=\"term\"} points out that if an employer reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers, then the best workers, those with the best employment alternatives at other firms, are the most likely to leave. The least attractive workers, with fewer employment alternatives, are more likely to stay. Consequently, firms are more likely to choose which workers should depart, through layoffs and firings, rather than trimming wages across the board. Sometimes companies that are going through tough times can persuade workers to take a pay cut for the short term, and still retain most of the firm\u2019s workers. But these stories are notable because they are so uncommon. It is far more typical for companies to lay off some workers, rather than to cut wages for everyone.\n\nThe **insider-outsider model**{: data-type=\"term\"} of the labor force, in simple terms, argues that those already working for firms are \u201cinsiders,\u201d while new employees, at least for a time, are \u201coutsiders.\u201d A firm depends on its insiders to grease the wheels of the organization, to be familiar with routine procedures, to train new employees, and so on. However, cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm\u2019s productivity and prospects.\n\nFinally, the **relative wage coordination argument**{: data-type=\"term\"} points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline, there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan. Instead, workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut, and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others. As a result, workers fight hard against wage cuts.\n\nThese theories of why wages tend not to move downward differ in their logic and their implications, and figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of each theory is an ongoing subject of research and controversy among economists. All tend to imply that wages will decline only very slowly, if at all, even when the economy or a business is having tough times. When wages are inflexible and unlikely to fall, then either short-run or long-run unemployment can result. This can be seen in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_013).\n\n is greater than the number of job openings (Qd). The result is unemployment, shown by the bracket in the figure.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C21_013 data-title=\"Sticky Wages in the Labor Market \"}\n\nThe interaction between shifts in labor demand and wages that are sticky downward are shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_014). [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_014) (a) illustrates the situation in which the demand for labor shifts to the right from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. In this case, the equilibrium wage rises from W<sub>0</sub> to W<sub>1</sub> and the equilibrium quantity of labor hired increases from Q<sub>0</sub> to Q<sub>1</sub>. It does not hurt employee morale at all for wages to rise.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_014) (b) shows the situation in which the demand for labor shifts to the left, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>, as it would tend to do in a recession. Because wages are sticky downward, they do not adjust toward what would have been the new equilibrium wage (Q<sub>1</sub>), at least not in the short run. Instead, after the shift in the labor demand curve, the same quantity of workers is willing to work at that wage as before; however, the quantity of workers demanded at that wage has declined from the original equilibrium (Q<sub>0</sub>) to Q<sub>2</sub>. The gap between the original equilibrium quantity (Q<sub>0</sub>) and the new quantity demanded of labor (Q<sub>2</sub>) represents workers who would be willing to work at the going wage but cannot find jobs. The gap represents the economic meaning of unemployment.\n\n In a labor market where wages are able to rise, an increase in the demand for labor from D0 to D1 leads to an increase in equilibrium quantity of labor hired from Q0 to Q1 and a rise in the equilibrium wage from W0 to W1. (b) In a labor market where wages do not decline, a fall in the demand for labor from D0 to D1 leads to a decline in the quantity of labor demanded at the original wage (W0) from Q0 to Q2. These workers will want to work at the prevailing wage (W0), but will not be able to find jobs.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C21_014 data-title=\"Rising Wage and Low Unemployment: Where Is the Unemployment in Supply and Demand? \"}\n\nThis analysis helps to explain the connection noted earlier: that unemployment tends to rise in recessions and to decline during expansions. The overall state of the economy shifts the labor demand curve and, combined with wages that are sticky downwards, unemployment changes. The rise in unemployment that occurs because of a recession is cyclical unemployment.\n\n\nThe St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank is the best resource for macroeconomic time series data, known as the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). [FRED][1] provides complete data sets on various measures of the unemployment rate as well as the monthly Bureau of Labor Statistics report on the results of the household and employment surveys.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nCyclical unemployment rises and falls with the business cycle. In a labor market with flexible wages, wages will adjust in such a market so that quantity demanded of labor always equals the quantity supplied of labor at the equilibrium wage. Many theories have been proposed for why wages might not be flexible, but instead may adjust only in a \u201csticky\u201d way, especially when it comes to downward adjustments: implicit contracts, efficiency wage theory, adverse selection of wage cuts, insider-outsider model, and relative wage coordination.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nBeginning in the 1970s and continuing for three decades, women entered the U.S. labor force in a big way. If we assume that wages are sticky in a downward direction, but that around 1970 the demand for labor equaled the supply of labor at the current wage rate, what do you imagine happened to the wage rate, employment, and unemployment as a result of increased labor force participation?\n\n\n\nBecause of the influx of women into the labor market, the supply of labor shifts to the right. Since wages are sticky downward, the increased supply of labor causes an increase in people looking for jobs (Qs), but no change in the number of jobs available (Qe). As a result, unemployment increases by the amount of the increase in the labor supply. This can be seen in the following figure.\n\nOver time, as labor demand grows, the unemployment will decline and eventually wages will begin to increase again. But this increase in labor demand goes beyond the scope of this problem.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C21_012}\n\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhen would you expect cyclical unemployment to be rising?

But what explains the remaining level of unemployment even in good economic times? Why is the unemployment rate never zero? Even when the U.S. economy is growing strongly, the unemployment rate only rarely dips as low as 4%. Moreover, the discussion earlier in this chapter pointed out that unemployment rates in many European countries like Italy, France, and Germany have often been remarkably high at various times in the last few decades. Why does some level of unemployment persist even when economies are growing strongly? Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies, through good economic years and bad? Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy: it is called the **natural rate of unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\n### The Long Run: The Natural Rate of Unemployment\n\nThe natural rate of unemployment is not \u201cnatural\u201d in the sense that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. It is not a physical and unchanging law of nature. Instead, it is only the \u201cnatural\u201d rate because it is the unemployment rate that would result from the combination of economic, social, and political factors that exist at a time\u2014assuming the economy was neither booming nor in recession. These forces include the usual pattern of companies expanding and contracting their workforces in a dynamic economy, social and economic forces that affect the labor market, or public policies that affect either the eagerness of people to work or the willingness of businesses to hire. Let\u2019s discuss these factors in more detail.\n\n### Frictional Unemployment\n\nIn a **market economy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons: old technology; poor management; good management that happened to make bad decisions; shifts in tastes of consumers so that less of the firm\u2019s product is desired; a large customer who went broke; or tough domestic or foreign competitors. Conversely, other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees. In a perfect world, all of those who lost jobs would immediately find new ones. But in the real world, even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies, it takes time to find out about new jobs, to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match, or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a new job. The unemployment that occurs in the meantime, as workers move between jobs, is called **frictional unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing. It takes time on part of both the employer and the individual to match those looking for employment with the correct job openings. For individuals and companies to be successful and productive, you want people to find the job for which they are best suited, not just the first job offered.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, before the recession of 2008\u20132009, it was true that about 7% of U.S. workers saw their jobs disappear in any three-month period. But in periods of economic growth, these destroyed jobs are counterbalanced for the economy as a whole by a larger number of jobs created. In 2005, for example, there were typically about 7.5 million unemployed people at any given time in the U.S. economy. Even though about two-thirds of those unemployed people found a job in 14 weeks or fewer, the unemployment rate did not change much during the year, because those who found new jobs were largely offset by others who lost jobs.\n\nOf course, it would be preferable if people who were losing jobs could immediately and easily move into the new jobs being created, but in the real world, that is not possible. Someone who is laid off by a textile mill in South Carolina cannot turn around and immediately start working for a textile mill in California. Instead, the adjustment process happens in ripples. Some people find new jobs near their old ones, while others find that they must move to new locations. Some people can do a very similar job with a different company, while others must start new career paths. Some people may be near retirement and decide to look only for part-time work, while others want an employer that offers a long-term career path. The frictional unemployment that results from people moving between jobs in a dynamic economy may account for one to two percentage points of total unemployment.\n\nThe level of frictional unemployment will depend on how easy it is for workers to learn about alternative jobs, which may reflect the ease of communications about job prospects in the economy. The extent of frictional unemployment will also depend to some extent on how willing people are to move to new areas to find jobs\u2014which in turn may depend on history and culture.\n\nFrictional unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment also seem to depend on the age distribution of the population. [\\[link\\]](/m48721#CNX_Econ_C21_011) (b) showed that unemployment rates are typically lower for people between 25\u201354 years of age than they are for those who are either younger or older. \u201cPrime-age workers,\u201d as those in the 25\u201354 age bracket are sometimes called, are typically at a place in their lives when they want to have a job and income arriving at all times. But some proportion of those who are under 30 may still be trying out jobs and life options and some proportion of those over 55 are eyeing retirement. In both cases, the relatively young or old tend to worry less about unemployment than those in-between, and their periods of frictional unemployment may be longer as a result. Thus, a society with a relatively high proportion of relatively young or old workers will tend to have a higher unemployment rate than a society with a higher proportion of its workers in middle age.\n\n### Structural Unemployment\n\nAnother factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of **structural unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor market, either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have, or because they never learned any skills. An example of the former would be the unemployment among aerospace engineers after the U.S. space program downsized in the 1970s. An example of the latter would be high school dropouts.\n\nSome people worry that technology causes structural unemployment. In the past, new technologies have put lower skilled employees out of work, but at the same time they create demand for higher skilled workers to use the new technologies. Education seems to be the key in minimizing the amount of structural unemployment. Individuals who have degrees can be retrained if they become structurally unemployed. For people with no skills and little education, that option is more limited.\n\n### Natural Unemployment and Potential Real GDP\n\nThe natural unemployment rate is related to two other important concepts: full employment and potential real GDP. The economy is considered to be at full employment when the actual unemployment rate is equal to the natural unemployment. When the economy is at full employment, real GDP is equal to potential real GDP. By contrast, when the economy is below full employment, the unemployment rate is greater than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP is less than potential. Finally, when the economy above full employment, then the unemployment rate is less than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP is greater than potential. Operating above potential is only possible for a short while, since it is analogous to all workers working overtime.\n\n### Productivity Shifts and the Natural Rate of Unemployment\n\nUnexpected shifts in productivity can have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. Over time, the level of wages in an economy will be determined by the productivity of workers. After all, if a business paid workers more than could be justified by their productivity, the business will ultimately lose money and go bankrupt. Conversely, if a business tries to pay workers less than their productivity then, in a competitive labor market, other businesses will find it worthwhile to hire away those workers and pay them more.\n\nHowever, adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly. **Wages**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} are typically reviewed only once or twice a year. In many modern jobs, it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level. For example, how precisely would one measure the quantity produced by an accountant who is one of many people working in the tax department of a large corporation? Because productivity is difficult to observe, wage increases are often determined based on recent experience with productivity; if productivity has been rising at, say, 2% per year, then wages rise at that level as well. However, when productivity changes unexpectedly, it can affect the natural rate of unemployment for a time.\n\nThe U.S. economy in the 1970s and 1990s provides two vivid examples of this process. In the 1970s, productivity growth slowed down unexpectedly (as discussed in [Economic Growth](/m48713)). For example, output per hour of U.S. workers in the business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.3% per year from 1960 to 1973, but only 0.8% from 1973 to 1982. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_015) (a) illustrates the situation where the demand for labor\u2014that is, the quantity of labor that business is willing to hire at any given wage\u2014has been shifting out a little each year because of rising productivity, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> to D<sub>2</sub>. As a result, equilibrium wages have been rising each year from W<sub>0</sub> to W<sub>1</sub> to W<sub>2</sub>. But when productivity unexpectedly slows down, the pattern of wage increases does not adjust right away. Wages keep rising each year from W<sub>2</sub> to W<sub>3</sub> to W<sub>4</sub>. But the demand for labor is no longer shifting up. A gap opens where the quantity of labor supplied at wage level W<sub>4</sub> is greater than the quantity demanded. The natural rate of unemployment rises; indeed, in the aftermath of this unexpectedly low productivity in the 1970s, the national unemployment rate did not fall below 7% from May, 1980 until 1986. Over time, the rise in wages will adjust to match the slower gains in productivity, and the unemployment rate will ease back down. But this process may take years.\n\n Productivity is rising, increasing the demand for labor. Employers and workers become used to the pattern of wage increases. Then productivity suddenly stops increasing. However, the expectations of employers and workers for wage increases do not shift immediately, so wages keep rising as before. But the demand for labor has not increased, so at wage W4, unemployment exists where the quantity supplied of labor exceeds the quantity demanded. (b) The rate of productivity increase has been zero for a time, so employers and workers have come to accept the equilibrium wage level (W). Then productivity increases unexpectedly, shifting demand for labor from D0 to D1. At the wage (W), this means that the quantity demanded of labor exceeds the quantity supplied, and with job offers plentiful, the unemployment rate will be low.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C21_015 data-title=\"Unexpected Productivity Changes and Unemployment \"}\n\nThe late 1990s provide an opposite example: instead of the surprise decline in productivity in the 1970s, productivity unexpectedly rose in the mid-1990s. The annual growth rate of real output per hour of labor increased from 1.7% from 1980\u20131995, to an annual rate of 2.6% from 1995\u20132001. Let\u2019s simplify the situation a bit, so that the economic lesson of the story is easier to see graphically, and say that productivity had not been increasing at all in earlier years, so the intersection of the labor market was at point E in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C21_015) (b), where the demand curve for labor (D<sub>0</sub>) intersects the supply curve for labor. As a result, real wages were not increasing. Now, productivity jumps upward, which shifts the demand for labor out to the right, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. At least for a time, however, wages are still being set according to the earlier expectations of no productivity growth, so wages do not rise. The result is that at the prevailing wage level (W), the quantity of labor demanded (Qd) will for a time exceed the quantity of labor supplied (Qs), and unemployment will be very low\u2014actually below the natural level of unemployment for a time. This pattern of unexpectedly high productivity helps to explain why the unemployment rate stayed below 4.5%\u2014quite a low level by historical standards\u2014from 1998 until after the U.S. economy had entered a recession in 2001.\n\nAverage levels of unemployment will tend to be somewhat higher on average when productivity is unexpectedly low, and conversely, will tend to be somewhat lower on average when productivity is unexpectedly high. But over time, wages do eventually adjust to reflect productivity levels.\n\n### Public Policy and the Natural Rate of Unemployment\n\nPublic policy can also have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. On the supply side of the labor market, public policies to assist the unemployed can affect how eager people are to find work. For example, if a worker who loses a job is guaranteed a generous package of unemployment insurance, welfare benefits, food stamps, and government medical benefits, then the opportunity cost of being unemployed is lower and that worker will be less eager to seek a new job.\n\nWhat seems to matter most is not just the amount of these benefits, but how long they last. A society that provides generous help for the unemployed that cuts off after, say, six months, may provide less of an incentive for unemployment than a society that provides less generous help that lasts for several years. Conversely, government assistance for job search or retraining can in some cases encourage people back to work sooner. See the Clear it Up to learn how the U.S. handles unemployment insurance.\n\n\n\nHow does U.S. unemployment insurance work?\n\nUnemployment insurance is a joint federal\u2013state program, established by federal law in 1935. The federal government sets minimum standards for the program, but most of the administration is done by state governments.\n\nThe funding for the program is a federal tax collected from employers. The federal government requires that the tax be collected on the first $7,000 in wages paid to each worker; however, states can choose to collect the tax on a higher amount if they wish, and 41 states have set a higher limit. States can choose the length of time that benefits will be paid, although most states limit unemployment benefits to 26 weeks\u2014with extensions possible in times of especially high unemployment. The fund is then used to pay benefits to those who become unemployed. Average unemployment benefits are equal to about one-third of the wage earned by the person in his or her previous job, but the level of unemployment benefits varies considerably across states.\n\n<table id=\"Table_07_01\" summary=\"This table has four columns and ten rows.

While there are statistics kept and studied relating to how many people are collecting unemployment insurance, this is not the source of unemployment rate information.\n\n\n\n\nView this [ article ][1] for an explanation of exactly who is eligible for unemployment benefits.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nOn the demand side of the labor market, government rules social institutions, and the presence of unions can affect the willingness of firms to hire. For example, if a government makes it hard for businesses to start up or to expand, by wrapping new businesses in bureaucratic red tape, then businesses will become more discouraged about hiring. Government regulations can make it harder to start a business by requiring that a new business obtain many permits and pay many fees, or by restricting the types and quality of products that can be sold. Other government regulations, like zoning laws, may limit where business can be done, or whether businesses are allowed to be open during evenings or on Sunday.\n\nWhatever defenses may be offered for such laws in terms of social value\u2014like the value some Christians place on not working on Sunday\u2014these kinds of restrictions impose a barrier between some willing workers and other willing employers, and thus contribute to a higher natural rate of unemployment. Similarly, if government makes it difficult to fire or lay off workers, businesses may react by trying not to hire more workers than strictly necessary\u2014since laying these workers off would be costly and difficult. High minimum wages may discourage businesses from hiring low-skill workers. Government rules may encourage and support powerful unions, which can then push up wages for union workers, but at a cost of discouraging businesses from hiring those workers.\n\n### The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Recent Years\n\nThe underlying economic, social, and political factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment can change over time, which means that the natural rate of unemployment can change over time, too.\n\nEstimates by economists of the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy in the early 2000s run at about 4.5 to 5.5%. This is a lower estimate than earlier. Three of the common reasons proposed by economists for this change are outlined below.\n\n1.  The Internet has provided a remarkable new tool through which job seekers can find out about jobs at different companies and can make contact with relative ease. An Internet search is far easier than trying to find a list of local employers and then hunting up phone numbers for all of their human resources departments, requesting a list of jobs and application forms, and so on. Social networking sites such as LinkedIn have changed how people find work as well.\n2.  The growth of the temporary worker industry has probably helped to reduce the natural rate of unemployment. In the early 1980s, only about 0.5% of all workers held jobs through temp agencies; by the early 2000s, the figure had risen above 2%. Temp agencies can provide jobs for workers while they are looking for permanent work. They can also serve as a clearinghouse, helping workers find out about jobs with certain employers and getting a tryout with the employer. For many workers, a temp job is a stepping-stone to a permanent job that they might not have heard about or gotten any other way, so the growth of temp jobs will also tend to reduce frictional unemployment.\n3.  The aging of the \u201cbaby boom generation\u201d\u2014the especially large generation of Americans born between 1946 and 1963\u2014meant that the proportion of young workers in the economy was relatively high in the 1970s, as the boomers entered the labor market, but is relatively low today. As noted earlier, middle-aged workers are far more likely to keep steady jobs than younger workers, a factor that tends to reduce the natural rate of unemployment.\n{: type=\"1\"}\n\nThe combined result of these factors is that the natural rate of unemployment was on average lower in the 1990s and the early 2000s than in the 1980s. The Great Recession of 2008\u20132009 pushed monthly unemployment rates above 10% in late 2009. But even at that time, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting that by 2015, unemployment rates would fall back to about 5%\u2014lower than it currently is, though not by much. As of early 2015, policymakers still think that unemployment has not yet reached its natural rate.\n\n### The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Europe\n\nBy the standards of other high-income economies, the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy appears relatively low. Through good economic years and bad, many European economies have had unemployment rates hovering near 10%, or even higher, since the 1970s. European rates of unemployment have been higher not because recessions in Europe have been deeper, but rather because the conditions underlying supply and demand for labor have been different in Europe, in a way that has created a much higher natural rate of unemployment.\n\nMany European countries have a combination of generous welfare and unemployment benefits, together with nests of rules that impose additional costs on businesses when they hire. In addition, many countries have laws that require firms to give workers months of notice before laying them off and to provide substantial severance or retraining packages after laying them off. The legally required notice before laying off a worker can be more than three months in Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Belgium, and the legally required severance package can be as high as a year\u2019s salary or more in Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Such laws will surely discourage laying off or firing current workers. But when companies know that it will be difficult to fire or lay off workers, they also become hesitant about hiring in the first place.\n\nThe typically higher levels of unemployment in many European countries in recent years, which have prevailed even when economies are growing at a solid pace, are attributable to the fact that the sorts of laws and regulations that lead to a high natural rate of unemployment are much more prevalent in Europe than in the United States.\n\n### A Preview of Policies to Fight Unemployment\n\nThe [Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy](/m48791) and [Macroeconomic Policy Around the World](/m48811) chapters provide a detailed discussion of how to fight unemployment, when these policies can be discussed in the context of the full array of macroeconomic goals and frameworks for analysis. But even at this preliminary stage, it is useful to preview the main issues concerning policies to fight unemployment.\n\nThe remedy for unemployment will depend on the diagnosis. Cyclical unemployment is a short-term problem, caused because the economy is in a recession. Thus, the preferred solution will be to avoid or minimize recessions. As [Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy ](/m48791) discusses, this policy can be enacted by stimulating the overall buying power in the economy, so that firms perceive that sales and profits are possible, which makes them eager to hire.\n\nDealing with the natural rate of unemployment is trickier. There is not much to be done about the fact that in a market-oriented economy, firms will hire and fire workers. Nor is there much to be done about how the evolving age structure of the economy, or unexpected shifts in productivity, will affect the natural rate of unemployment for a time. However, as the example of high ongoing unemployment rates for many European countries illustrates, government policy clearly can affect the natural rate of unemployment that will persist even when GDP is growing.\n\nWhen a government enacts policies that will affect workers or employers, it must examine how these policies will affect the information and incentives employees and employers have to seek each other out. For example, the government may have a role to play in helping some of the unemployed with job searches. The design of government programs that offer assistance to unemployed workers and protections to employed workers may need to be rethought so that they will not unduly discourage the supply of labor. Similarly, rules that make it difficult for businesses to begin or to expand may need to be redesigned so that they will not unduly discourage the demand for labor. The message is not that all laws affecting labor markets should be repealed, but only that when such laws are enacted, a society that cares about unemployment will need to consider the tradeoffs involved.\n\n\n\nThe Mysterious Case of the Missing Candidates\n\nAfter reading the chapter you might think the current unemployment conundrum may be due to structural unemployment. Indeed, there is a mismatch between the skills employers are seeking and the skills the unemployed possess. But Peter Cappelli has a slightly different view on this\u2014it is called the purple squirrel. The what?\n\nIn human resource parlance, a purple squirrel is a job candidate who is a perfect fit for all of the many different responsibilities of a position. A purple squirrel candidate could step into a multi-faceted position with no training and permit the firm to higher fewer people because the worker is so versatile. During the Great Recession, Human Resources (HR) positions were reduced. This means today\u2019s hiring managers are drafting job descriptions and requirements without much, if any HR feedback. \u201cIt turns out it\\'s typically the case that employers\\' requirements are crazy, they\\'re not paying enough, or their applicant screening is so rigid that nobody gets through,\u201d Cappelli stated in a 2012 Knowledge@Wharton interview about the findings in his book, *Why Good People Can\u2019t Find Jobs: Chasing After the Purple Squirrel*. In short, managers are searching for \u201cpurple squirrels\u201d when what they really need are just versatile workers. There really is not a shortage of \u201cnormal squirrels\u201d\u2014candidates who are versatile workers. The managers just cannot find them because their requirements, screening processes, and compensation will filter out all but the \u201cpurple\u201d ones.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment that would be caused by the economic, social, and political forces in the economy even when the economy is not in a recession. These factors include the frictional unemployment that occurs when people are put out of work for a time by the shifts of a dynamic and changing economy and any laws concerning conditions of hiring and firing have the undesired side effect of discouraging job formation. They also include structural unemployment, which occurs when demand shifts permanently away from a certain type of job skill.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIs the increase in labor force participation rates among women better thought of as causing an increase in cyclical unemployment or an increase in the natural rate of unemployment? Why?\n\n\n\nThe increase in labor supply was a social demographic trend\u2014it was not caused by the economy falling into a recession. Therefore, the influx of women into the work force increased the natural rate of unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany college students graduate from college before they have found a job. When graduates begin to look for a job, they are counted as what category of unemployed?\n\n\n\nNew entrants to the labor force, whether from college or otherwise, are counted as frictionally unemployed until they find a job.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat term describes the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat forces create the natural rate of unemployment for an economy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you expect the natural rate of unemployment to be roughly the same in different countries?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you expect the natural rate of unemployment to remain the same within one country over the long run of several decades?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is frictional unemployment? Give examples of frictional unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is structural unemployment? Give examples of structural unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter several years of economic growth, would you expect the unemployment in an economy to be mainly cyclical or mainly due to the natural rate of unemployment? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat type of unemployment (cyclical, frictional, or structural) applies to each of the following:\n\n1.  landscapers laid off in response to drop in new housing construction during a recession.\n2.  coal miners laid off due to EPA regulations that shut down coal fired power\n3.  a financial analyst who quits his/her job in Chicago and is pursing similar work in Arizona\n4.  printers laid off due to drop in demand for printed catalogues and flyers as firms go the internet to promote an advertise their products.\n5.  factory workers in the U.S. laid off as the plants shut down and move to Mexico and Ireland.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nUnder what condition would a decrease in unemployment be bad for the economy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder what condition would an increase in the unemployment rate be a positive sign?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the baby boom generation retires, the ratio of retirees to workers will increase noticeably. How will this affect the Social Security program? How will this affect the standard of living of the average American?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment rates have been higher in many European countries in recent decades than in the United States. Is the main reason for this long-term difference in unemployment rates more likely to be cyclical unemployment or the natural rate of unemployment? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it desirable to pursue a goal of zero unemployment? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it desirable to eliminate natural unemployment? Why or why not? *Hint*: Think about what our economy would look like today and what assumptions would have to be met to have a zero rate of natural unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate increased from 4.6% in July 2001 to 5.9% by June 2002. Without studying the subject in any detail, would you expect that a change of this kind is more likely to be due to cyclical unemployment or a change in the natural rate of unemployment? Why?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nAs the baby boomer generation retires, what should happen to wages and employment?

Inflation is when most prices in an entire economy are rising. But there is an extreme form of inflation called hyperinflation. This occurred in Germany between 1921 and 1928, and more recently in Zimbabwe between 2008 and 2009. In November of 2008, Zimbabwe had an inflation rate of 79.6 billion percent. In contrast, in 2014, the United States had an average annual rate of inflation of 1.6%.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s inflation rate was so high it is difficult to comprehend. So, let\u2019s put it into context. It is equivalent to price increases of 98% per day. This means that, from one day to the next, prices essentially double. What is life like in an economy afflicted with hyperinflation? Not like anything you are familiar with. Prices for commodities in Zimbabwean dollars were adjusted several times *each day*. There was no desire to hold on to currency since it lost value by the minute. The people there spent a great deal of time getting rid of any cash they acquired by purchasing whatever food or other commodities they could find. At one point, a loaf of bread cost 550 million Zimbabwean dollars. Teachers were paid in the trillions a month; however this was equivalent to only one U.S. dollar a day. At its height, it took 621,984,228 Zimbabwean dollars to purchase one U.S. dollar.\n\nGovernment agencies had no money to pay their workers so they started printing money to pay their bills rather than raising taxes. Rising prices caused the government to enact price controls on private businesses, which led to shortages and the emergence of black markets. In 2009, the country abandoned its currency and allowed foreign currencies to be used for purchases.\n\nHow does this happen? How can both government and the economy fail to function at the most basic level? Before we consider these extreme cases of hyperinflation, let\u2019s first look at inflation itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Inflation\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Tracking Inflation\n* How Changes in the Cost of Living are Measured\n* How the U.S. and Other Countries Experience Inflation\n* The Confusion Over Inflation\n* Indexing and Its Limitations\n\n\n\n**Inflation**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy. Inflation does not refer to a change in relative prices. A relative price change occurs when you see that the price of tuition has risen, but the price of laptops has fallen. Inflation, on the other hand, means that there is pressure for prices to rise in most markets in the economy. In addition, price increases in the supply-and-demand model were one-time events, representing a shift from a previous equilibrium to a new one. Inflation implies an ongoing rise in prices. If inflation happened for one year and then stopped\u2014well, then it would not be inflation any more.\n\nThis chapter begins by showing how to combine prices of individual goods and services to create a measure of overall inflation. It discusses the historical and recent experience of inflation, both in the United States and in other countries around the world. Other chapters have sometimes included a note under an exhibit or a parenthetical reminder in the text saying that the numbers have been adjusted for inflation. In this chapter, it is time to show how to use inflation statistics to adjust other economic variables, so that you can tell how much of, say, the rise in GDP over different periods of time can be attributed to an actual increase in the production of goods and services and how much should be attributed to the fact that prices for most things have risen.\n\nInflation has consequences for people and firms throughout the economy, in their roles as lenders and borrowers, wage-earners, taxpayers, and consumers. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some imperfections and biases in the inflation statistics, and a preview of policies for fighting inflation that will be discussed in other chapters.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

You used to be able to buy three gallons of gasoline for a dollar and then go see an afternoon movie for another dollar.\u201d [\\[link\\]](#Table_22_01) compares some prices of common goods in 1970 and 2014. Of course, the average prices shown in this table may not reflect the prices where you live. The cost of living in New York City is much higher than in Houston, Texas, for example. In addition, certain products have evolved over recent decades. A new car in 2014, loaded with antipollution equipment, safety gear, computerized engine controls, and many other technological advances, is a more advanced machine (and more fuel efficient) than your typical 1970s car. However, put details like these to one side for the moment, and look at the overall pattern. The primary reason behind the price rises in [\\[link\\]](#Table_22_01)\u2014and all the price increases for the other products in the economy\u2014is not specific to the market for housing or cars or gasoline or movie tickets. Instead, it is part of a general rise in the level of all prices. In 2014, $1 had about the same purchasing power in overall terms of goods and services as 18 cents did in 1972, because of the amount of inflation that has occurred over that time period.\n\n<table id=\"Table_22_01\" summary=\"This table has three columns and eight rows.

The second-to-last row of [\\[link\\]](#Table_22_01) shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased nearly six-fold from 1970 to 2014. Sure, the average worker in 2014 is better educated and more productive than the average worker in 1970\u2014but not six times more productive. Sure, **per capita GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} increased substantially from 1970 to 2014, but is the average person in the U.S. economy really more than eight times better off in just 44 years? Not likely.\n\nA modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand. How can all of these shifts in price be boiled down to a single inflation rate? As with many problems in economic measurement, the conceptual answer is reasonably straightforward: Prices of a variety of goods and services are combined into a single price level; the inflation rate is simply the percentage change in the price level. Applying the concept, however, involves some practical difficulties.\n\n### The Price of a Basket of Goods\n\nTo calculate the **price level**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, economists begin with the concept of a **basket of goods and services**{: data-type=\"term\"}, consisting of the different items individuals, businesses, or organizations typically buy. The next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time. In thinking about how to combine individual prices into an overall price level, many people find that their first impulse is to calculate the average of the prices. Such a calculation, however, could easily be misleading because some products matter more than others.\n\nChanges in the prices of goods for which people spend a larger share of their incomes will matter more than changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a smaller share of their incomes. For example, an increase of 10% in the rental rate on housing matters more to most people than whether the price of carrots rises by 10%. To construct an overall measure of the price level, economists compute a weighted average of the prices of the items in the basket, where the weights are based on the actual quantities of goods and services people buy. The following Work It Out feature walks you through the steps of calculating the annual rate of inflation based on a few products.\n\n\n\nCalculating an Annual Rate of Inflation\n\nConsider the simple basket of goods with only three items, represented in [\\[link\\]](#Table_22_02). Say that in any given month, a college student spends money on 20 hamburgers, one bottle of aspirin, and five movies. Prices for these items over four years are given in the table through each time period (Pd). Prices of some goods in the basket may rise while others fall. In this example, the price of aspirin does not change over the four years, while movies increase in price and hamburgers bounce up and down. Each year, the cost of buying the given basket of goods at the prices prevailing at that time is shown.\n\n<table id=\"Table_22_02\" summary=\"The table consists of 10 rows and 6 columns.

Find the **percentage change**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} in the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time periods. The general equation for percentage changes between two years, whether in the context of inflation or in any other calculation, is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mfrac><mfenced><mtext>Level\u00a0in\u00a0new\u00a0year\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Level\u00a0in\u00a0previous\u00a0year</mtext></mfenced><mtext>Level\u00a0in\u00a0previous\u00a0year</mtext></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Percentage\u00a0change</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 2. From period 1 to period 2, the total cost of purchasing the basket of goods in [\\[link\\]](#Table_22_02) rises from $100 to $106.50.

Hamburgers are the lowest-priced good in this example, and aspirin is the highest-priced. If an individual buys a greater quantity of a low-price good, then it makes sense that changes in the price of that good should have a larger impact on the buying power of that person\u2019s money. The larger impact of hamburgers shows up in the \u201camount spent\u201d row, where, in all time periods, hamburgers are the largest item within the amount spent row.\n\n\n\n### Index Numbers\n\nThe numerical results of a calculation based on a basket of goods can get a little messy. The simplified example in [\\[link\\]](#Table_22_02) has only three goods and the prices are in even dollars, not numbers like 79 cents or $124.99. If the list of products was much longer, and more realistic prices were used, the total quantity spent over a year might be some messy-looking number like $17,147.51 or $27,654.92.\n\nTo simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods, the price level in each period is typically reported as an **index number**{: data-type=\"term\"}, rather than as the dollar amount for buying the basket of goods. Price indices are created to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time. To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number, economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the **base year**{: data-type=\"term\"}, or starting point from which we measure changes in prices. The base year, by definition, has an index number equal to 100. This sounds complicated, but it is really a simple math trick. In the example above, say that time period 3 is chosen as the base year. Since the total amount of spending in that year is $107, we divide that amount by itself ($107) and multiply by 100. Mathematically, that is equivalent to dividing $107 by 100, or $1.07. Doing either will give us an index in the base year of 100. Again, this is because the index number in the base year *always* has to have a value of 100. Then, to figure out the values of the index number for the other years, we divide the dollar amounts for the other years by 1.07 as well. Note also that the dollar signs cancel out so that index numbers have no units.\n\nCalculations for the other values of the index number, based on the example presented in [\\[link\\]](#Table_22_02) are shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_22_03). Because the index numbers are calculated so that they are in exactly the same proportion as the total dollar cost of purchasing the basket of goods, the inflation rate can be calculated based on the index numbers, using the percentage change formula. So, the inflation rate from period 1 to period 2 would be\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mfrac><mfenced><mtext>99.5\u00a0\u2013\u00a093.4</mtext></mfenced><mtext>93.4</mtext></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>0.065</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>6.5%</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nThis is the same answer that was derived when measuring inflation based on the dollar cost of the basket of goods for the same time period.\n\n<table id=\"Table_22_03\" summary=\"The table has 4 columns and 5 rows.

The advantage is that indexing allows easier eyeballing of the inflation numbers. If you glance at two index numbers like 107 and 110, you know automatically that the rate of inflation between the two years is about, but not quite exactly equal to, 3%. By contrast, imagine that the price levels were expressed in absolute dollars of a large basket of goods, so that when you looked at the data, the numbers were $19,493.62 and $20,009.32. Most people find it difficult to eyeball those kinds of numbers and say that it is a change of about 3%. However, the two numbers expressed in absolute dollars are exactly in the same proportion of 107 to 110 as the previous example. If you\u2019re wondering why simple subtraction of the index numbers wouldn\u2019t work, read the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\nWhy do you not just subtract index numbers?\n\nA word of warning: When a price index moves from, say, 107 to 110, the rate of inflation is not *exactly* 3%. Remember, the inflation rate is not derived by subtracting the index numbers, but rather through the percentage-change calculation. The precise inflation rate as the price index moves from 107 to 110 is calculated as (110 \u2013 107) / 107 = 0.028 = 2.8%. When the base year is fairly close to 100, a quick subtraction is not a terrible shortcut to calculating the inflation rate\u2014but when precision matters down to tenths of a percent, subtracting will not give the right answer.\n\n\n\nTwo final points about index numbers are worth remembering. First, index numbers have no dollar signs or other units attached to them. Although index numbers can be used to calculate a percentage inflation rate, the index numbers themselves do not have percentage signs. Index numbers just mirror the proportions found in other data. They transform the other data so that the data are easier to work with.\n\nSecond, the choice of a base year for the index number\u2014that is, the year that is automatically set equal to 100\u2014is arbitrary. It is chosen as a starting point from which changes in prices are tracked. In the official inflation statistics, it is common to use one base year for a few years, and then to update it, so that the base year of 100 is relatively close to the present. But any base year that is chosen for the index numbers will result in exactly the same inflation rate. To see this in the previous example, imagine that period 1, when total spending was $100, was also chosen as the base year, and given an index number of 100. At a glance, you can see that the index numbers would now exactly match the dollar figures, the inflation rate in the first period would be 6.5%, and so on.\n\nNow that we see how indexes work to track inflation, the next module will show us how the cost of living is measured.\n\n\nWatch this [video][1] from the cartoon *Duck Tales* to view a mini-lesson on inflation.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe price level is measured by using a basket of goods and services and calculating how the total cost of buying that basket of goods will increase over time. The price level is often expressed in terms of index numbers, which transform the cost of buying the basket of goods and services into a series of numbers in the same proportion to each other, but with an arbitrary base year of 100. The rate of inflation is measured as the percentage change between price levels or index numbers over time.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\n[[link]](#Table_22_04) shows the prices of fruit purchased by the typical college student from 2001 to 2004.

In recent years, the statisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem: that the change in the total cost of buying a fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the **cost of living**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility.\n\nTo understand the distinction, imagine that over the past 10 years, the cost of purchasing a fixed basket of goods increased by 25% and your salary also increased by 25%. Has your personal standard of living held constant? If you do not necessarily purchase an identical fixed basket of goods every year, then an inflation calculation based on the cost of a fixed basket of goods may be a misleading measure of how your cost of living has changed. Two problems arise here: substitution bias and quality/new goods bias.\n\nWhen the price of a good rises, consumers tend to purchase less of it and to seek out substitutes instead. Conversely, as the price of a good falls, people will tend to purchase more of it. This pattern implies that goods with generally rising prices should tend over time to become less important in the overall basket of goods used to calculate inflation, while goods with falling prices should tend to become more important. Consider, as an example, a rise in the price of peaches by $100 per pound. If consumers were utterly inflexible in their demand for peaches, this would lead to a big rise in the price of food for consumers. Alternatively, imagine that people are utterly indifferent to whether they have peaches or other types of fruit. Now, if peach prices rise, people completely switch to other fruit choices and the average price of food does not change at all. A fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods, regardless of price changes\u2014not a very likely assumption. Thus, **substitution bias**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time\u2014tends to overstate the rise in a consumer\u2019s true cost of living, because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen.\n\nThe other major problem in using a fixed basket of goods as the basis for calculating inflation is how to deal with the arrival of improved versions of older goods or altogether new goods. Consider the problem that arises if a cereal is improved by adding 12 essential vitamins and minerals\u2014and also if a box of the cereal costs 5% more. It would clearly be misleading to count the entire resulting higher price as inflation, because the new price is being charged for a product of higher (or at least different) quality. Ideally, one would like to know how much of the higher price is due to the quality change, and how much of it is just a higher price. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is responsible for the computation of the Consumer Price Index, must deal with these difficulties in adjusting for quality changes.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to view a list of Ford car prices between 1909 and 1927. Consider how these prices compare to today\u2019s models. Is the product today of a different quality?\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nA new product can be thought of as an extreme improvement in quality\u2014from something that did not exist to something that does. However, the basket of goods that was fixed in the past obviously does not include new goods created since then. The basket of goods and services used in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is revised and updated over time, and so new products are gradually included. But the process takes some time. For example, room air conditioners were widely sold in the early 1950s, but were not introduced into the basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index until 1964. The VCR and personal computer were available in the late 1970s and widely sold by the early 1980s, but did not enter the CPI basket of goods until 1987. By 1996, there were more than 40 million cellular phone subscribers in the United States\u2014but cell phones were not yet part of the CPI basket of goods. The parade of inventions has continued, with the CPI inevitably lagging a few years behind.\n\nThe arrival of new goods creates problems with respect to the accuracy of measuring inflation. The reason people buy new goods, presumably, is that the new goods offer better value for money than existing goods. Thus, if the price index leaves out new goods, it overlooks one of the ways in which the cost of living is improving. In addition, the price of a new good is often higher when it is first introduced and then declines over time. If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years, until its price is already lower, the CPI may miss counting this price decline altogether. Taking these arguments together, the **quality/new goods bias**{: data-type=\"term\"} means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer\u2019s true cost of living, because it does not take into account how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the standard of living. The following Clear It Up feature is a must-read on how the CPI is comprised and calculated.\n\n\n\nHow do U.S. government statisticians measure the Consumer Price Index?\n\nWhen the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the Consumer Price Index, the first task is to decide on a basket of goods that is representative of the purchases of the average household. This is done by using the Consumer Expenditure Survey, a national survey of about 7,000 households, which provides detailed information on spending habits. Consumer expenditures are broken up into eight major groups, shown below, which in turn are broken up into more than 200 individual item categories. The BLS currently uses 1982\u20131984 as the base period.\n\nFor each of the 200 individual expenditure items, the BLS chooses several hundred very specific examples of that item and looks at the prices of those examples. So, in figuring out the \u201cbreakfast cereal\u201d item under the overall category of \u201cfoods and beverages,\u201d the BLS picks several hundred examples of breakfast cereal. One example might be the price of a 24-oz. box of a particular brand of cereal sold at a particular store. The specific products and sizes and stores chosen are statistically selected to reflect what people buy and where they shop. The basket of goods in the Consumer Price Index thus consists of about 80,000 products; that is, several hundred specific products in over 200 broad-item categories. About one-quarter of these 80,000 specific products are rotated out of the sample each year, and replaced with a different set of products.\n\nThe next step is to collect data on prices. Data collectors visit or call about 23,000 stores in 87 urban areas all over the United States every month to collect prices on these 80,000 specific products. A survey of 50,000 landlords or tenants is also carried out to collect information about rents.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index is then calculated by taking the 80,000 prices of individual products and combining them, using weights (as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C22_009)) determined by the quantities of these products that people buy and allowing for factors like substitution between goods and quality improvements, into price indices for the 200 or so overall items. Then, the price indices for the 200 items are combined into an overall Consumer Price Index. According the Consumer Price Index website, there are eight categories used by data collectors:\n\n**The Eight Major Categories in the Consumer Price Index**\n\n1.  Food and beverages (breakfast cereal, milk, coffee, chicken, wine, full-service meals, and snacks)\n2.  Housing (renter\u2019s cost of housing, homeowner\u2019s cost of housing, fuel oil, bedroom furniture)\n3.  Apparel (men\u2019s shirts and sweaters, women\u2019s dresses, jewelry)\n4.  Transportation (new vehicles, airline fares, gasoline, motor vehicle insurance)\n5.  Medical care (prescription drugs and medical supplies, physicians\u2019 services, eyeglasses and eye care, hospital services)\n6.  Recreation (televisions, cable television, pets and pet products, sports equipment, admissions)\n7.  Education and communication (college tuition, postage, telephone services, computer software and accessories)\n8.  Other goods and services (tobacco and smoking products, haircuts and other personal services, funeral expenses)\n{: type=\"1\"}\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C22_009 data-title=\"The Weighting of CPI Components \"}\n\n\n\n\n### The CPI and Core Inflation Index    {#eip-298}\n\nImagine if you were driving a company truck across the country- you probably would care about things like the prices of available roadside food and motel rooms as well as the truck\u2019s operating condition. However, the manager of the firm might have different priorities. He would care mostly about the truck\u2019s on-time performance and much less so about the food you were eating and the places you were staying. In other words, the company manager would be paying attention to the production of the firm, while ignoring transitory elements that impacted you, but did not affect the company\u2019s bottom line.\n\nIn a sense, a similar situation occurs with regard to measures of inflation. As we\u2019ve learned, CPI measures prices as they affect everyday household spending. Well, a **core inflation index**{: data-type=\"term\"} is typically calculated by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables. In this way, economists have a better sense of the underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living.\n\nExamples of excluded variables include energy and food prices, which can jump around from month to month because of the weather. According to an article by Kent Bernhard, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a key supply point for the nation\u2019s gasoline was nearly knocked out. Gas prices quickly shot up across the nation, in some places up to 40 cents a gallon in one day. This was not the cause of an economic policy but rather a short-lived event until the pumps were restored in the region. In this case, the CPI that month would register the change as a cost of living event to households, but the core inflation index would remain unchanged. As a result, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decisions on interest rates would not be influenced. Similarly, droughts can cause world-wide spikes in food prices that, if temporary, do not affect the nation\u2019s economic capability.\n\nAs former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke noted in 1999 about the core inflation index, \u201cIt provide(s) a better guide to monetary policy than the other indices, since it measures the more persistent underlying inflation rather than transitory influences on the price level.\u201d Bernanke also noted that it helps communicate that every inflationary shock need not be responded to by the Federal Reserve since some price changes are transitory and not part of a structural change in the economy.\n\nIn sum, both the CPI and the core inflation index are important, but serve different audiences. The CPI helps households understand their overall cost of living from month to month, while the core inflation index is a preferred gauge from which to make important government policy changes.\n\n### Practical Solutions for the Substitution and the Quality/New Goods Biases\n\nBy the early 2000s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics was using alternative mathematical methods for calculating the Consumer Price Index, more complicated than just adding up the cost of a fixed basket of goods, to allow for some substitution between goods. It was also updating the basket of goods behind the CPI more frequently, so that new and improved goods could be included more rapidly. For certain products, the BLS was carrying out studies to try to measure the quality improvement. For example, with computers, an economic study can try to adjust for changes in speed, memory, screen size, and other characteristics of the product, and then calculate the change in price after these product changes are taken into account. But these adjustments are inevitably imperfect, and exactly how to make these adjustments is often a source of controversy among professional economists.\n\nBy the early 2000s, the substitution bias and quality/new goods bias had been somewhat reduced, so that since then the rise in the CPI probably overstates the true rise in inflation by only about 0.5% per year. Over one or a few years, this is not much; over a period of a decade or two, even half of a percent per year compounds to a more significant amount. In addition, the CPI tracks prices from physical locations, and not at online sites like Amazon, where prices can be lower.\n\nWhen measuring inflation (and other economic statistics, too), a tradeoff arises between simplicity and interpretation. If the inflation rate is calculated with a basket of goods that is fixed and unchanging, then the calculation of an inflation rate is straightforward, but the problems of substitution bias and quality/new goods bias will arise. However, when the basket of goods is allowed to shift and evolve to reflect substitution toward lower relative prices, quality improvements, and new goods, the technical details of calculating the inflation rate grow more complex.\n\n### Additional Price Indices: PPI, GDP Deflator, and More\n\nThe basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index represents an average hypothetical U.S. household, which is to say that it does not exactly capture anyone\u2019s personal experience. When the task is to calculate an average level of inflation, this approach works fine. What if, however, you are concerned about inflation experienced by a certain group, like the elderly, or the poor, or single-parent families with children, or Hispanic-Americans? In specific situations, a price index based on the buying power of the average consumer may not feel quite right.\n\nThis problem has a straightforward solution. If the Consumer Price Index does not serve the desired purpose, then invent another index, based on a basket of goods appropriate for the group of interest. Indeed, the Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a number of experimental price indices: some for particular groups like the elderly or the poor, some for different geographic areas, and some for certain broad categories of goods like food or housing.\n\nThe BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods. For example, the **Producer Price Index (PPI)**{: data-type=\"term\"} is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services. It can be broken down into price indices for different industries, commodities, and stages of processing (like finished goods, intermediate goods, crude materials for further processing, and so on). There is an **International Price Index**{: data-type=\"term\"} based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported. An **Employment Cost Index**{: data-type=\"term\"} measures wage inflation in the labor market. The **GDP deflator**{: data-type=\"term\"}, measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, is a price index that includes all the components of GDP (that is, consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports). Unlike the CPI, its baskets are not fixed but re-calculate what that year\u2019s GDP would have been worth using the base-year\u2019s prices. MIT\\'s Billion Prices Project is a more recent alternative attempt to measure prices: data are collected online from retailers and then composed into an index that is compared to the CPI (Source: http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/).\n\nWhat\u2019s the best measure of inflation? If concerned with the most accurate measure of inflation, use the GDP deflator as it picks up the prices of goods and services produced. However, it is not a good measure of cost of living as it includes prices of many products not purchased by households (for example, aircraft, fire engines, factory buildings, office complexes, and bulldozers). If one wants the most accurate measure of inflation as it impacts households, use the CPI, as it only picks up prices of products purchased by households. That is why the CPI is sometimes referred to as the cost-of-living index. As the Bureau of Labor Statistics states on its website: \u201cThe \u2018best\u2019 measure of inflation for a given application depends on the intended use of the data.\u201d\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nMeasuring price levels with a fixed basket of goods will always have two problems: the substitution bias, by which a fixed basket of goods does not allow for buying more of what is relatively less expensive and less of what is relatively more expensive; and the quality/new goods bias, by which a fixed basket cannot take into account improvements in quality and the advent of new goods. These problems can be reduced in degree\u2014for example, by allowing the basket of goods to evolve over time\u2014but they cannot be totally eliminated. The most commonly cited measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is based on a basket of goods representing what the typical consumer buys. The Core Inflation Index further breaks down the CPI by excluding volatile economic variables. Several price indices are not based on baskets of consumer goods. The GDP deflator is based on all the components of GDP. The Producer Price Index is based on prices of supplies and inputs bought by producers of goods and services. An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market. An International Price Index is based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\n[How Changes in the Cost of Living are Measured](/m48726) introduced a number of different price indices. Which price index would be best to use to adjust your paycheck for inflation?\n\n\n\nSince the CPI measures the prices of the goods and services purchased by the typical urban consumer, it measures the prices of things that people buy with their paycheck. For that reason, the CPI would be the best price index to use for this purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Consumer Price Index is subject to the substitution bias and the quality/new goods bias. Are the Producer Price Index and the GDP Deflator also subject to these biases? Why or why not?\n\n\n\nThe PPI is subject to those biases for essentially the same reasons as the CPI is. The GDP deflator picks up prices of what is actually purchased that year, so there are no biases. That is the advantage of using the GDP deflator over the CPI.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhy does \u201csubstitution bias\u201d arise if the inflation rate is calculated based on a fixed basket of goods?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the \u201cquality/new goods bias\u201d arise if the inflation rate is calculated based on a fixed basket of goods?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question\n\n\n\nGiven the federal budget deficit in recent years, some economists have argued that by adjusting Social Security payments for inflation using the CPI, Social Security is overpaying recipients. What is the argument being made, and do you agree or disagree with it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the GDP deflator not an accurate measure of inflation as it impacts a household?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine that the government statisticians who calculate the inflation rate have been updating the basic basket of goods once every 10 years, but now they decide to update it every five years. How will this change affect the amount of substitution bias and quality/new goods bias?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe a situation, either a government policy situation, an economic problem, or a private sector situation, where using the CPI to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate than using the GDP deflator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe a situation, either a government policy situation, an economic problem, or a private sector situation, where using the GDP deflator to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate than using the CPI.\n\n\n\n\n### References   {#eip-462}\n\nBernhard, Kent. \u201cPump Prices Jump Across U.S. after Katrina.\u201d *NBC News*, September 1, 2005. http://www.nbcnews.com/id/9146363/ns/business-local\\\\\\_business/t/pump-prices-jump-across-us-after-katrina/#.U00kRfk7um4.\n\nWynne, Mark A. \u201cCore Inflation, A Review of Some Conceptual Issues.\u201d *Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis*. p. 209.

Looking back over the twentieth century, there have been several periods where inflation caused the price level to rise at double-digit rates, but nothing has come close to hyperinflation.\n\n### Historical Inflation in the U.S. Economy\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C22_008) (a) shows the level of prices in the Consumer Price Index stretching back to 1916. In this case, the base years (when the CPI is defined as 100) are set for the average level of prices that existed from 1982 to 1984. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C22_008) (b) shows the annual percentage changes in the CPI over time, which is the inflation rate.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C22_008 data-title=\"U.S. Price Level and Inflation Rates since 1913 \"}\n\nThe first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms: they are right after World War I and World War II. However, there are also two periods of severe negative inflation\u2014called **deflation**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014in the early decades of the twentieth century: one following the deep recession of 1920\u201321 and the other during the Great Depression of the 1930s. (Since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced, deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases.) For the period from 1900 to about 1960, the major inflations and deflations nearly balanced each other out, so the average annual rate of inflation over these years was only about 1% per year. A third wave of more severe inflation arrived in the 1970s and departed in the early 1980s.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to use an inflation calculator and discover how prices have changed in the last 100 years.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nTimes of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower, as in the recession of 1920\u20131921, the Great Depression, the recession of 1980\u20131982, and the **Great Recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} in 2008\u20132009. There were a few months in 2009 that were deflationary, but not at an annual rate. Recessions are typically accompanied by higher levels of unemployment, and the total demand for goods falls, pulling the price level down. Conversely, the rate of inflation often, but not always, seems to start moving up when the economy is growing very strongly, like right after wartime or during the 1960s. The frameworks for macroeconomic analysis, developed in other chapters, will explain why recession often accompanies higher unemployment and lower inflation, while rapid economic growth often brings lower unemployment but higher inflation.\n\n### Inflation around the World\n\nAround the rest of the world, the pattern of inflation has been very mixed, as can be seen in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C22_010) which shows inflation rates over the last several decades. Many industrialized countries, not just the United States, had relatively high inflation rates in the 1970s. For example, in 1975, Japan\u2019s inflation rate was over 8% and the inflation rate for the United Kingdom was almost 25%. In the 1980s, inflation rates came down in the United States and in Europe and have largely stayed down.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C22_010 data-title=\"Countries with Relatively Low Inflation Rates, 1960&#x2013;2014\"}\n\nCountries with controlled economies in the 1970s, like the Soviet Union and China, historically had very low rates of measured inflation\u2014because prices were forbidden to rise by law, except for the cases where the government deemed a price increase to be due to quality improvements. However, these countries also had perpetual shortages of goods, since forbidding prices to rise acts like a price ceiling and creates a situation where quantity demanded often exceeds quantity supplied. As Russia and China made a transition toward more market-oriented economies, they also experienced outbursts of inflation, although the statistics for these economies should be regarded as somewhat shakier. Inflation in China averaged about 10% per year for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, although it has dropped off since then. Russia experienced **hyperinflation**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014an outburst of high inflation\u2014of 2,500% per year in the early 1990s, although by 2006 Russia\u2019s consumer price inflation had dipped below 10% per year, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C22_011). The closest the United States has ever gotten to hyperinflation was during the Civil War, 1860\u20131865, in the Confederate states.\n\n Of these, Brazil and Russia experienced hyperinflation at some point between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s. (b) Though not as high, China and Nigeria also had high inflation rates in the mid-1990s. Even though their inflation rates have come down over the last two decades, several of these countries continue to see significant inflation rates. (Sources: http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FPCPITOTLZGBRA; http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI; http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FPCPITOTLZGRUS)\"){: #CNX_Econ_C22_011 data-title=\"Countries with Relatively High Inflation Rates, 1980&#x2013;2013\"}\n\nMany countries in Latin America experienced raging hyperinflation during the 1980s and early 1990s, with inflation rates often well above 100% per year. In 1990, for example, both Brazil and Argentina saw inflation climb above 2000%. Certain countries in Africa experienced extremely high rates of inflation, sometimes bordering on hyperinflation, in the 1990s. Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, had an inflation rate of 75% in 1995.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the problem of inflation appears to have diminished for most countries, at least in comparison to the worst times of recent decades. As we noted in this earlier Bring it Home feature, in recent years, the world\u2019s worst example of hyperinflation was in Zimbabwe, where at one point the government was issuing bills with a face value of $100 trillion (in Zimbabwean dollars)\u2014that is, the bills had $100,000,000,000,000 written on the front, but were almost worthless. In many countries, the memory of double-digit, triple-digit, and even quadruple-digit inflation is not very far in the past.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nIn the U.S. economy, the annual inflation rate in the last two decades has typically been around 2% to 4%. The periods of highest inflation in the United States in the twentieth century occurred during the years after World Wars I and II, and in the 1970s. The period of lowest inflation\u2014actually, with deflation\u2014was the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\n### Self-Check Question\n\n\n\nGo to this [website][2] for the Purchasing Power Calculator at MeasuringWorth.com.

One of his questions asked, \u201cDo you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority, as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools?\u201d Answers were on a scale of 1\u20135, where 1 meant \u201cFully agree\u201d and 5 meant \u201cCompletely disagree.\u201d For the U.S. population as a whole, 52% answered \u201cFully agree\u201d that preventing high inflation was a highly important national priority and just 4% said \u201cCompletely disagree.\u201d However, among professional economists, only 18% answered \u201cFully agree,\u201d while the same percentage of 18% answered \u201cCompletely disagree.\u201d\n\n### The Land of Funny Money\n\nWhat are the economic problems caused by inflation, and why do economists often regard them with less concern than the general public? Consider a very short story: \u201c**The Land of Funny Money**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\u201d\n\nOne morning, everyone in the Land of Funny Money awakened to find that everything denominated in money had increased by 20%. The change was completely unexpected. Every price in every store was 20% higher. Paychecks were 20% higher. Interest rates were 20 % higher. The amount of money, everywhere from wallets to savings accounts, was 20% larger. This overnight inflation of prices made newspaper headlines everywhere in the Land of Funny Money. But the headlines quickly disappeared, as people realized that in terms of what they could actually buy with their incomes, this inflation had no economic impact. Everyone\u2019s pay could still buy exactly the same set of goods as it did before. Everyone\u2019s savings were still sufficient to buy exactly the same car, vacation, or retirement that they could have bought before. Equal levels of inflation in all wages and prices ended up not mattering much at all.\n\nWhen the people in Robert Shiller\u2019s surveys explained their concern about inflation, one typical reason was that they feared that as prices rose, they would not be able to afford to buy as much. In other words, people were worried because they did not live in a place like the Land of Funny Money, where all prices and wages rose simultaneously. Instead, people live here on Planet Earth, where prices might rise while wages do not rise at all, or where wages rise more slowly than prices.\n\nEconomists note that over most periods, the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in **wages**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, and so they reason that, on average, over time, people\u2019s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation. If all prices, wages, and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation, as in the Land of Funny Money, then no one\u2019s purchasing power, profits, or real loan payments would change. However, if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation, or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag, then inflation can cause three types of problems: unintended **redistributions**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of purchasing power, blurred price signals, and difficulties in long-term planning.\n\n### Unintended Redistributions of Purchasing Power\n\nInflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power that hurt some and help others. People who are hurt by inflation include those who are holding a lot of cash, whether it is in a safe deposit box or in a cardboard box under the bed. When inflation happens, the buying power of cash is diminished. But cash is only an example of a more general problem: anyone who has financial assets invested in a way that the nominal return does not keep up with inflation will tend to suffer from inflation. For example, if a person has money in a bank account that pays 4% interest, but inflation rises to 5%, then the real rate of return for the money invested in that bank account is negative 1%.\n\nThe problem of a good-looking **nominal interest rate**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} being transformed into an ugly-looking **real interest rate**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} can be worsened by taxes. The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms, without an adjustment for inflation. So, a person who invests $10,000 and receives a 5% nominal rate of interest is taxed on the $500 received\u2014no matter whether the inflation rate is 0%, 5%, or 10%. If inflation is 0%, then the real interest rate is 5% and all $500 is a gain in buying power. But if inflation is 5%, then the real interest rate is zero and the person had no real gain\u2014but owes income tax on the nominal gain anyway. If inflation is 10%, then the real interest rate is *negative* 5% and the person is actually falling behind in buying power, but would still owe taxes on the $500 in nominal gains.\n\nInflation can cause unintended redistributions for wage earners, too. Wages do typically creep up with inflation over time eventually. The last row of [\\[link\\]](/m48725#Table_22_01) at the start of this chapter showed that average hourly wage in the U.S. economy increased from $3.23 in 1970 to $19.55 in 2014, which is an increase by a factor of almost six. Over that time period, the Consumer Price Index increased by an almost identical amount. However, increases in wages may lag behind inflation for a year or two, since wage adjustments are often somewhat sticky and occur only once or twice a year. Moreover, the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful, prolonged conflicts between employers and employees. If the **minimum wage**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is adjusted for inflation only infrequently, minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C22_013).\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C22_013 data-title=\"U.S. Minimum Wage and Inflation \"}\n\nOne sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time: retirees who receive a private company pension. Most **pensions**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement. For this reason, pensions are called \u201cdefined benefits\u201d plans. Even if inflation is low, the combination of inflation and a fixed income can create a substantial problem over time. A person who retires on a fixed income at age 65 will find that losing just 1% to 2% of buying power per year to inflation compounds to a considerable loss of buying power after a decade or two.\n\nFortunately, pensions and other defined benefits retirement plans are increasingly rare, replaced instead by \u201cdefined contribution\u201d plans, such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s. In these plans, the employer contributes a fixed amount to the worker\u2019s retirement account on a regular basis (usually every pay check). The employee often contributes as well. The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles. These plans are tax deferred, and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer, their **401(k)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} comes with them. To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return, retirees do not suffer from the inflation costs of traditional pensioners.\n\nHowever, ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation. Consider someone who borrows $10,000 to buy a car at a fixed interest rate of 9%. If inflation is 3% at the time the loan is made, then the loan must be repaid at a real interest rate of 6%. But if inflation rises to 9%, then the real interest rate on the loan is zero. In this case, the borrower\u2019s benefit from inflation is the lender\u2019s loss. A borrower paying a fixed interest rate, who benefits from inflation, is just the flip side of an investor receiving a fixed interest rate, who suffers from inflation. The lesson is that when interest rates are fixed, rises in the rate of inflation tend to penalize suppliers of financial capital, who end up being repaid in dollars that are worth less because of inflation, while demanders of financial capital end up better off, because they can repay their loans in dollars that are worth less than originally expected.\n\nThe unintended redistributions of buying power caused by inflation may have a broader effect on society. America\u2019s widespread acceptance of market forces rests on a perception that people\u2019s actions have a reasonable connection to market outcomes. When inflation causes a retiree who built up a pension or invested at a fixed interest rate to suffer, however, while someone who borrowed at a fixed interest rate benefits from inflation, it is hard to believe that this outcome was deserved in any way. Similarly, when homeowners benefit from inflation because the price of their homes rises, while renters suffer because they are paying higher rent, it is hard to see any useful incentive effects. One of the reasons that inflation is so disliked by the general public is a sense that it makes economic rewards and penalties more arbitrary\u2014and therefore likely to be perceived as unfair \u2013 even dangerous, as the next Clear It Up feature shows.\n\n\n\nIs there a connection between German hyperinflation and Hitler\u2019s rise to power?\n\nGermany suffered an intense hyperinflation of its currency, the Mark, in the years after World War I, when the Weimar Republic in Germany resorted to printing money to pay its bills and the onset of the Great Depression created the social turmoil that Adolf Hitler could take advantage of in his rise to power. Shiller described the connection this way in a National Bureau of Economic Research 1996 Working Paper:\n\n<q>A fact that is probably little known to young people today, even in Germany, is that the final collapse of the Mark in 1923, the time when the Mark\u2019s inflation reached astronomical levels (inflation of 35,974.9% in November 1923 alone, for an annual rate that month of 4.69 \u00d7 10<sup>28</sup>%), came in the same month as did Hitler\u2019s Beer Hall Putsch, his Nazi Party\u2019s armed attempt to overthrow the German government. This failed putsch resulted in Hitler\u2019s imprisonment, at which time he wrote his book *Mein Kampf*, setting forth an inspirational plan for Germany\u2019s future, suggesting plans for world domination. . .</q> <q>. . . Most people in Germany today probably do not clearly remember these events; this lack of attention to it may be because its memory is blurred by the more dramatic events that succeeded it (the Nazi seizure of power and World War II). However, to someone living through these historical events in sequence . . . \\[the putsch\\] may have been remembered as vivid evidence of the potential effects of inflation.</q>\n\n\n\n### Blurred Price Signals\n\nPrices are the messengers in a **market economy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, conveying information about conditions of demand and supply. Inflation blurs those price messages. Inflation means that price signals are perceived more vaguely, like a radio program received with a lot of static. If the static becomes severe, it is hard to tell what is happening.\n\nIn Israel, when inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 500% in 1985, some stores stopped posting prices directly on items, since they would have had to put new labels on the items or shelves every few days to reflect inflation. Instead, a shopper just took items from a shelf and went up to the checkout register to find out the price for that day. Obviously, this situation makes comparing prices and shopping for the best deal rather difficult. When the levels and changes of prices become uncertain, businesses and individuals find it harder to react to economic signals. In a world where inflation is at a high rate, but bouncing up and down to some extent, does a higher price of a good mean that inflation has risen, or that supply of that good has decreased, or that demand for that good has increased? Should a buyer of the good take the higher prices as an economic hint to start substituting other products\u2014or have the prices of the substitutes risen by an equal amount? Should a seller of the good take a higher price as a reason to increase production\u2014or is the higher price only a sign of a general inflation in which the prices of all inputs to production are rising as well? The true story will presumably become clear over time, but at a given moment, who can say?\n\nHigh and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker. Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly, and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of **surpluses**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **shortages**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\n### Problems of Long-Term Planning\n\nInflation can make long-term planning difficult. In discussing unintended **redistributions**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, we considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of inflation. Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement, because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when the rate of future inflation cannot be known with certainty.\n\nInflation, especially at moderate or high levels, will pose substantial planning problems for businesses, too. A firm can make money from inflation\u2014for example, by paying bills and wages as late as possible so that it can pay in inflated dollars, while collecting revenues as soon as possible. A firm can also suffer losses from inflation, as in the case of a retail business that gets stuck holding too much cash, only to see the value of that cash eroded by inflation. But when a business spends its time focusing on how to profit by inflation, or at least how to avoid suffering from it, an inevitable tradeoff strikes: less time is spent on improving products and services or on figuring out how to make existing products and services more cheaply. An economy with high inflation rewards businesses that have found clever ways of profiting from inflation, which are not necessarily the businesses that excel at productivity, innovation, or quality of service.\n\nIn the short term, low or moderate levels of inflation may not pose an overwhelming difficulty for business planning, because costs of doing business and sales revenues may rise at similar rates. If, however, inflation varies substantially over the short or medium term, then it may make sense for businesses to stick to shorter-term strategies. The evidence as to whether relatively low rates of inflation reduce productivity is controversial among economists. There is some evidence that if inflation can be held to moderate levels of less than 3% per year, it need not prevent a nation\u2019s real economy from growing at a healthy pace. For some countries that have experienced hyperinflation of several thousand percent per year, an annual inflation rate of 20\u201330% may feel basically the same as zero. However, several economists have pointed to the suggestive fact that when U.S. inflation heated up in the early 1970s\u2014to 10%\u2014U.S. growth in productivity slowed down, and when inflation slowed down in the 1980s, productivity edged up again not long thereafter, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C22_014).\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C22_014 data-title=\"U.S. Inflation Rate and U.S. Labor Productivity, 1961&#x2013;2014 \"}\n\n### Any Benefits of Inflation?\n\nAlthough the economic effects of inflation are primarily negative, two countervailing points are worth noting. First, the impact of inflation will differ considerably according to whether it is creeping up slowly at 0% to 2% per year, galloping along at 10% to 20% per year, or racing to the point of hyperinflation at, say, 40% per month. Hyperinflation can rip an economy and a society apart. An annual inflation rate of 2%, 3%, or 4%, however, is a long way from a national crisis. Low inflation is also better than deflation which occurs with severe recessions.\n\nSecond, an argument is sometimes made that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in **labor markets**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} more flexible. The discussion in [Unemployment](/m48719){: .target-chapter} pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their downward movements and that unemployment can result. A little inflation could nibble away at real wages, and thus help real wages to decline if necessary. In this way, even if a moderate or high rate of inflation may act as sand in the gears of the economy, perhaps a low rate of inflation serves as oil for the gears of the labor market. This argument is controversial. A full analysis would have to take all the effects of inflation into account. It does, however, offer another reason to believe that, all things considered, very low rates of inflation may not be especially harmful.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nUnexpected inflation will tend to hurt those whose money received, in terms of wages and interest payments, does not rise with inflation. In contrast, inflation can help those who owe money that can be paid in less valuable, inflated dollars. Low rates of inflation have relatively little economic impact over the short term. Over the medium and the long term, even low rates of inflation can complicate future planning. High rates of inflation can muddle price signals in the short term and prevent market forces from operating efficiently, and can vastly complicate long-term savings and investment decisions.\n\n### Self-Check Question\n\n\n\nIf inflation rises unexpectedly by 5%, would a state government that had recently borrowed money to pay for a new highway benefit or lose?\n\n\n\nThe state government would benefit because it would repay the loan in less valuable dollars than it borrowed. Plus, tax revenues for the state government would increase because of the inflation.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Question\n\n\n\nIdentify several parties likely to be helped and hurt by inflation.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nIf, over time, wages and salaries on average rise at least as fast as inflation, why do people worry about how inflation affects incomes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho in an economy is the big winner from inflation?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nShiller, Robert. \u201cWhy Do People Dislike Inflation?\u201d *NBER Working Paper Series, National Bureau of Economic Research*, p. 52. 1996.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48730", "module_title": "Economics - m48730", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48730", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Explain the relationship between indexing and inflation\n* Identify three ways the government can control inflation through macroeconomic policy\n\n\n\nWhen a price, wage, or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation, it is said to be **indexed**{: data-type=\"term\"}. An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation. A wide array of indexing arrangements is observed in **private markets**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and government programs. Since the negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another\u2014say, increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive\u2014indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation.\n\n### Indexing in Private Markets\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had **cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs)**{: data-type=\"term\"} which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation. These contracts were sometimes written as, for example, COLA plus 3%. Thus, if inflation was 5%, the wage increase would automatically be 8%, but if inflation rose to 9%, the wage increase would automatically be 12%. COLAs are a form of indexing applied to wages.\n\nLoans often have built-in inflation adjustments, too, so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points, then the interest rate charged on the loan rises by two percentage points as well. An **adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a kind of loan used to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation. Often, a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an ARM, compared to a fixed-rate loan. The reason is that with an ARM, the lender is protected against the risk that higher inflation will reduce the real loan payments, and so the risk premium part of the interest rate can be correspondingly lower.\n\nA number of ongoing or long-term business contracts also have provisions that prices will be adjusted automatically according to inflation. Sellers like such contracts because they are not locked into a low nominal selling price if inflation turns out higher than expected; buyers like such contracts because they are not locked into a high buying price if inflation turns out to be lower than expected. A contract with automatic adjustments for inflation in effect agrees on a real price to be paid, rather than a nominal price.\n\n### Indexing in Government Programs\n\nMany government programs are indexed to inflation. The U.S. income tax code is designed so that as a person\u2019s income rises above certain levels, the tax rate on the marginal income earned rises as well; this is what is meant by the expression \u201cmove into a higher tax bracket.\u201d For example, according to the basic tax tables from the Internal Revenue Service, in 2014 a single person owed 10% of all taxable income from $0 to $9,075; 15% of all income from $9,076 to $36,900; 25% of all taxable income from $36,901 to $89,350; 28% of all taxable income from $89,351 to $186,350; 33% of all taxable income from $186,351 to $405,100; 35% of all taxable income from $405,101 to $406,750; and 39.6% of all income from $406,751 and above.\n\nBecause of the many complex provisions in the rest of the tax code, the taxes owed by any individual cannot be exactly determined based on these numbers, but the numbers illustrate the basic theme that tax rates rise as the marginal dollar of income rises. Until the late 1970s, if nominal wages increased along with inflation, people were moved into higher tax brackets and owed a higher proportion of their income in taxes, even though their real income had not risen. This \u201cbracket creep,\u201d as it was called, was eliminated by law in 1981. Now, the income levels where higher tax rates kick in are indexed to rise automatically with inflation.\n\nThe Social Security program offers two examples of indexing. Since the passage of the **Social Security Indexing Act of 1972**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index. Also, Social Security is funded by payroll taxes, which are imposed on the income earned up to a certain amount\u2014$117,000 in 2014. This level of income is adjusted upward each year according to the rate of inflation, so that the indexed rise in the benefit level is accompanied by an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base.\n\nAs yet another example of a government program affected by indexing, in 1996 the U.S., government began offering indexed **bonds**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Bonds are means by which the U.S. government (and many private-sector companies as well) borrows money; that is, investors buy the bonds, and then the government repays the money with interest. Traditionally, government bonds have paid a fixed rate of interest. This policy gave a government that had borrowed an incentive to encourage inflation, because it could then repay its past borrowing in inflated dollars at a lower real interest rate. But indexed bonds promise to pay a certain real rate of interest above whatever inflation rate occurs. In the case of a retiree trying to plan for the long term and worried about the risk of inflation, for example, indexed bonds that guarantee a rate of return higher than inflation\u2014no matter the level of inflation\u2014can be a very comforting investment.\n\n### Might Indexing Reduce Concern over Inflation?\n\nIndexing may seem like an obviously useful step. After all, when individuals, firms, and government programs are indexed against inflation, then people can worry less about arbitrary redistributions and other effects of inflation.\n\nHowever, some of the fiercest opponents of inflation express grave concern about indexing. They point out that indexing is always partial. Not every employer will provide COLAs for workers. Not all companies can assume that costs and revenues will rise in lockstep with the general rates of inflation. Not all interest rates for borrowers and savers will change to match inflation exactly. But as partial inflation indexing spreads, the political opposition to inflation may diminish. After all, older people whose Social Security benefits are protected against inflation, or banks that have loaned their money with adjustable-rate loans, no longer have as much reason to care whether inflation heats up. In a world where some people are indexed against inflation and some are not, financially savvy businesses and investors may seek out ways to be protected against inflation, while the financially unsophisticated and small businesses may suffer from it most.\n\n### A Preview of Policy Discussions of Inflation\n\nThis chapter has focused on how inflation is measured, historical experience with inflation, how to adjust nominal variables into real ones, how inflation affects the economy, and how indexing works. The causes of inflation have barely been hinted at, and government policies to deal with inflation have not been addressed at all. These issues will be taken up in depth in other chapters. However, it is useful to offer a preview here.\n\nThe cause of inflation can be summed up in one sentence: Too many dollars chasing too few goods. The great surges of inflation early in the twentieth century came after wars, which are a time when government spending is very high, but consumers have little to buy, because production is going to the war effort. Governments also commonly impose price controls during wartime. After the war, the price controls end and pent-up buying power surges forth, driving up inflation. On the other hand, if too few dollars are chasing too many goods, then inflation will decline or even turn into deflation. Therefore, slowdowns in economic activity, as in major recessions and the Great Depression, are typically associated with a reduction in inflation or even outright deflation.\n\nThe policy implications are clear. If inflation is to be avoided, the amount of purchasing power in the economy must grow at roughly the same rate as the production of goods. Macroeconomic policies that the government can use to affect the amount of purchasing power\u2014through taxes, spending, and regulation of interest rates and credit\u2014can thus cause inflation to rise or reduce inflation to lower levels.\n\n\n\nA $550 Million Loaf of Bread?\n\nAs we will learn in [Money and Banking](/m48761){: .target-chapter}, the existence of money provides enormous benefits to an economy. In a real sense, money is the lubrication that enhances the workings of markets. Money makes transactions easier. It allows people to find employment producing one product, then use the money earned to purchase the other products they need to live on. However, too much money in circulation can lead to inflation. Extreme cases of governments recklessly printing money lead to hyperinflation. Inflation reduces the value of money. Hyperinflation, because money loses value so quickly, ultimately results in people no longer using money. The economy reverts to barter, or it adopts another country\u2019s more stable currency, like U.S. dollars. In the meantime, the economy literally falls apart as people leave jobs and fend for themselves because it is not worth the time to work for money that will be worthless in a few days.\n\nOnly national governments have the power to cause hyperinflation. Hyperinflation typically happens when government faces extraordinary demands for spending, which it cannot finance by taxes or borrowing. The only option is to print money\u2014more and more of it. With more money in circulation chasing the same amount (or even less) goods and services, the only result is higher and higher prices until the economy and/or the government collapses. This is why economists are generally wary of letting inflation get out of control.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA payment is said to be indexed if it is automatically adjusted for inflation. Examples of indexing in the private sector include wage contracts with cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) and loan agreements like adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Examples of indexing in the public sector include tax brackets and Social Security payments.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nHow should an increase in inflation affect the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage?\n\n\n\nHigher inflation reduces real interest rates on fixed rate mortgages. Because ARMs can be adjusted, higher inflation leads to higher interest rates on ARMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fixed-rate mortgage has the same interest rate over the life of the loan, whether the mortgage is for 15 or 30 years. By contrast, an adjustable-rate mortgage changes with market interest rates over the life of the mortgage. If inflation falls unexpectedly by 3%, what would likely happen to a homeowner with an adjustable-rate mortgage?\n\n\n\nBecause the mortgage has an adjustable rate, the rate should fall by 3%, the same as inflation, to keep the real interest rate the same.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is indexing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName several forms of indexing in the private and public sector.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nIf a government gains from unexpected inflation when it borrows, why would it choose to offer indexed bonds?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you think perfect indexing is possible?

Do you think not much? Think again. Suppose you take out a student loan, or you deposit money into your bank account. You just affected domestic savings and borrowing. Now say you are at the mall and buy two T-shirts \u201cmade in China,\u201d and later contribute to a charity that helps refugees. What is the impact? You affected how much money flows into and out of the United States. If you open an IRA savings account and put money in an international mutual fund, you are involved in the flow of money overseas. While your involvement may not seem as influential as someone like the president, who can increase or decrease foreign aid and, thereby, have a huge impact on money flows in and out of the country, you do interact with the global financial system on a daily basis.\n\nThe balance of payments\u2014a term you will meet soon\u2014seems like a huge topic, but once you learn the specific components of trade and money, it all makes sense. Along the way, you may have to give up some common misunderstandings about trade and answer some questions: If a country is running a trade deficit, is that bad? Is a trade surplus good? For example, look at the Democratic Republic of Congo (often referred to as \u201cCongo\u201d), a large country in Central Africa. In 2013, it ran a trade surplus of $1 billion, so it must be doing well, right? In contrast, the trade deficit in the United States was $508 billion in 2013. Do these figures suggest that the economy in the United States is doing worse than the Congolese economy? Not necessarily. The U.S. trade deficit tends to worsen as the economy strengthens. In contrast, high poverty rates in the Congo persist, and these rates are not going down even with the positive trade balance. Clearly, it is more complicated than simply asserting that running a trade deficit is bad for the economy. You will learn more about these issues and others in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to International Trade and Capital Flows\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Measuring Trade Balances\n* Trade Balances in Historical and International Context\n* Trade Balances and Flows of Financial Capital\n* The National Saving and Investment Identity\n* The Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and Surpluses\n* The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance\n\n\n\nThe **balance of trade**{: data-type=\"term\"} (or trade balance) is any gap between a nation\u2019s dollar value of its exports, or what its producers sell abroad, and a nation\u2019s dollar worth of imports, or the foreign-made products and services that households and businesses purchase. Recall from [The Macroeconomic Perspective](/m48705){: .target-chapter} that if exports exceed imports, the economy is said to have a **trade surplus**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. If imports exceed exports, the economy is said to have a **trade deficit**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. If exports and imports are equal, then trade is balanced. But what happens when trade is out of balance and large trade surpluses or deficits exist?\n\nGermany, for example, has had substantial trade surpluses in recent decades, in which exports have greatly exceeded imports. According to the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s The World Factbook, in 2013, Germany ran a trade surplus of $260 billion. In contrast, the U.S. economy in recent decades has experienced large trade deficits, in which imports have considerably exceeded exports. In 2014, for example, U.S. imports exceeded exports by $539 billion.\n\nA series of financial crises triggered by unbalanced trade can lead economies into deep recessions. These crises begin with large trade deficits. At some point, foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries. The economy then drops into deep recession, with **real GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} often falling up to 10% or more in a single year. This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1%. A number of countries in East Asia\u2014Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia\u2014came down with the same economic illness in 1997\u20131998 (called the Asian Financial Crisis). In the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, Russia and Argentina had the identical experience. What are the connections between imbalances of trade in goods and services and the flows of international financial capital that set off these economic avalanches?\n\nWe will start by examining the balance of trade in more detail, by looking at some patterns of trade balances in the United States and around the world. Then we will examine the intimate connection between international flows of goods and services and international flows of financial capital, which to economists are really just two sides of the same coin. It is often assumed that trade surpluses like those in Germany must be a positive sign for an economy, while trade deficits like those in the United States must be harmful. As it turns out, both trade surpluses and deficits can be either good or bad. We will see why in this chapter.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48732", "module_title": "Economics - m48732", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48732", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Explain merchandise trade balance, current account balance, and unilateral transfers\n* Identify components of the U.S. current account balance\n* Calculate the merchandise trade balance and current account balance using import and export data for a country\n\n\n\nA few decades ago, it was common to track the solid or physical items that were transported by planes, trains, and trucks between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade. This measurement is called the **merchandise trade balance**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In most high-income economies, including the United States, goods make up less than half of a country\u2019s total production, while services compose more than half. The last two decades have seen a surge in international trade in services, powered by technological advances in telecommunications and computers that have made it possible to export or import customer services, finance, law, advertising, management consulting, software, construction engineering, and product design. Most global trade still takes the form of goods rather than services, and the merchandise trade balance is still announced by the government and reported prominently in the newspapers. Old habits are hard to break. Economists, however, typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the **current account balance**{: data-type=\"term\"} which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid.\n\n### Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_23_01) breaks down the four main components of the U.S. current account balance for the last quarter of 2014 (seasonally adjusted). The first line shows the merchandise trade balance; that is, exports and imports of goods. Because imports exceed exports, the trade balance in the final column is negative, showing a merchandise trade deficit. How this trade information is collected is explained in the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n<table id=\"Table_23_01\" summary=\"This table has four columns and five rows. The first row is a header row and it labels each column, &#x201C;Exports (money flowing into the United States),&#x201D; &#x201C;Imports (money flowing out of the United States),&#x201D; and &#x201C;Balance.&#x201D; Under the &#x201C;Exports (money flowing into the United States)&#x201D; column are the values: Goods $410.0; Services $180.4; Income receipts and payments $203.0; Unilateral transfers $27.3; and Current account balance $820.7. Under the &#x201C;Imports (money flowing out of the United States)&#x201D; are the values: $595.3; $122.3; $152.4; $64.4; and $934.4. Under the &#x201C;Balance&#x201D; column are the values: &#x2212;$185.3; $58.1; $50.6; &#x2212;$37.1; and &#x2212;$113.7.\"><caption><span data-type=\"title\">Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance for 2014 (in billions)</span></caption><thead>\n<tr>\n<th />\n<th>Value of Exports (money flowing into the United States)</th>\n<th>Value of Imports (money flowing out of the United States)</th>\n<th>Balance</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Goods</td>\n<td>$410.0</td>\n<td>$595.5</td>\n<td>\u2013$185.3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Services</td>\n<td>$180.4</td>\n<td>$122.3</td>\n<td>$58.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Income receipts and payments</td>\n<td>$203.0</td>\n<td>$152.4</td>\n<td>$50.6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unilateral transfers</td>\n<td>$27.3</td>\n<td>$64.4</td>\n<td>\u2013$37.1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Current account balance</strong></td>\n<td>$820.7</td>\n<td>$934.4</td>\n<td>\u2013$113.7</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n\n\nHow does the U.S. government collect trade statistics?\n\nDo not confuse the balance of trade (which tracks imports and exports), with the current account balance, which includes not just **exports**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **imports**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, but also income from investment and transfers.\n\nStatistics on the balance of trade are compiled by the **Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} within the **U.S. Department of Commerce**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, using a variety of different sources. Importers and exporters of merchandise must file monthly documents with the Census Bureau, which provides the basic data for tracking trade. To measure international trade in services\u2014which can happen over a telephone line or computer network without any physical goods being shipped\u2014the BEA carries out a set of surveys. Another set of BEA surveys track investment flows, and there are even specific surveys to collect travel information from U.S. residents visiting Canada and Mexico. For measuring unilateral transfers, the BEA has access to official U.S. government spending on aid, and then also carries out a survey of charitable organizations that make foreign donations.\n\nThis information on international flows of goods and capital is then cross-checked against other available data. For example, the Census Bureau also collects data from the shipping industry, which can be used to check the data on trade in goods. All companies involved in international flows of capital\u2014including banks and companies making financial investments like stocks\u2014must file reports, which are ultimately compiled by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Information on foreign trade can also be cross-checked by looking at data collected by other countries on their foreign trade with the United States, and also at the data collected by various international organizations. Take these data sources, stir carefully, and you have the U.S. balance of trade statistics. Much of the statistics cited in this chapter come from these sources.\n\n\n\nThe second row of [\\[link\\]](#Table_23_01) provides data on trade in services. Here, the U.S. economy is running a **surplus**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods, the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades. For example, U.S. exports of services were equal to about one-half of U.S. exports of goods in 2014, compared to one-fifth in 1980.\n\nThe third component of the current account balance, labeled \u201c**income payments**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis},\u201d refers to money received by U.S. financial investors on their foreign investments (money flowing into the United States) and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here (money flowing out of the United States). The reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade, along with goods and services, is that, from an economic perspective, income is just as much an economic transaction as shipments of cars or wheat or oil: it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market.\n\nThe final category of the current account balance is **unilateral transfers**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which are payments made by government, private charities, or individuals in which money is sent abroad without any direct good or service being received. Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into this category, as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities. When an individual in the United States sends money overseas, it is also counted in this category. The current account balance treats these unilateral payments like imports, because they also involve a stream of payments leaving the country. For the U.S. economy, unilateral transfers are almost always negative. This pattern, however, does not always hold. In 1991, for example, when the United States led an international coalition against Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq in the Gulf War, many other nations agreed that they would make payments to the United States to offset the U.S. war expenses. These payments were large enough that, in 1991, the overall U.S. balance on unilateral transfers was a positive $10 billion.\n\nThe following Work It Out feature steps you through the process of using the values for goods, services, and income payments to calculate the merchandise balance and the current account balance.\n\n\n\nCalculating the Merchandise Balance and the Current Account Balance\n\n<table id=\"Table_23_02\" summary=\"This table has 6 rows and four columns.

Focus on goods and services first. Enter the dollar amount of exports of both goods and services under the Export column.\n\nStep 2. Enter imports of goods and services under the Import column.\n\nStep 3. Under the Export column and in the row for Income payments, enter the financial flows of money coming back to the United States. U.S. investors are earning this income from abroad.\n\nStep 4. Under the Import column and in the row for Income payments, enter the financial flows of money going out of the United States to foreign investors. Foreign investors are earning this money on U.S. assets, like stocks.\n\nStep 5. Unilateral transfers are money flowing out of the United States in the form of military aid, foreign aid, global charities, and so on. Because the money leaves the country, it is entered under Imports and in the final column as well, as a negative.\n\nStep 6. Calculate the trade balance by subtracting imports from exports in both goods and services. Enter this in the final Balance column. This can be positive or negative.\n\nStep 7. Subtract the income payments flowing out of the country (under Imports) from the money coming back to the United States (under Exports) and enter this amount under the Balance column.\n\nStep 8. Enter unilateral transfers as a negative amount under the Balance column.\n\nStep 9. The merchandise trade balance is the difference between exports of goods and imports of goods\u2014the first number under Balance.\n\nStep 10. Now sum up your columns for Exports, Imports, and Balance. The final balance number is the current account balance.\n\nThe merchandise balance of trade is the difference between exports and imports. In this case, it is the difference between $1,046 \u2013 $1,562, a trade deficit of \u2013$516 billion. The current account balance is \u2013$419 billion.

In most high-income economies, goods make up less than half of a country\u2019s total production, while services compose more than half. The last two decades have seen a surge in international trade in services; however, most global trade still takes the form of goods rather than services. The current account balance includes the trade in goods, services, and money flowing into and out of a country from investments and unilateral transfers.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIf foreign investors buy more U.S. stocks and bonds, how would that show up in the current account balance?\n\n\n\nThe stock and bond values will not show up in the current account. However, the dividends from the stocks and the interest from the bonds show up as an import to income in the current account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the trade deficit of the United States increases, how is the current account balance affected?\n\n\n\nIt becomes more negative as imports, which are a negative to the current account, are growing faster than exports, which are a positive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nState whether each of the following events involves a financial flow to the Mexican economy or a financial flow out of the Mexican economy:\n\n1.  Mexico imports services from Japan\n2.  Mexico exports goods to Canada\n3.  U.S. investors receive a return from past financial investments in Mexico\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  Money flows out of the Mexican economy.\n2.  Money flows into the Mexican economy.\n3.  Money flows out of the Mexican economy.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nIf imports exceed exports, is it a trade deficit or a trade surplus? What about if exports exceed imports?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is included in the current account balance?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nFrom time to time, a government official will argue that a country should strive for both a trade surplus and a healthy inflow of capital from abroad. Explain why such a statement is economically impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA government official announces a new policy. The country wishes to eliminate its trade deficit, but will strongly encourage financial investment from foreign firms. Explain why such a statement is contradictory.\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nIn 2001, the economy of the United Kingdom exported goods worth \u00a3192 billion and services worth another \u00a377 billion. It imported goods worth \u00a3225 billion and services worth \u00a366 billion. Receipts of income from abroad were \u00a3140 billion while income payments going abroad were \u00a3131 billion. Government transfers from the United Kingdom to the rest of the world were \u00a323 billion, while various U.K government agencies received payments of \u00a316 billion from the rest of the world.\n\n1.  Calculate the U.K. merchandise trade deficit for 2001.\n2.  Calculate the current account balance for 2001.\n3.  Explain how you decided whether payments on foreign investment and government transfers counted on the positive or the negative side of the current account balance for the United Kingdom in 2001.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency. \u201cThe World Factbook.\u201d Last modified October 31, 2013. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html.\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce. \u201cBureau of Economic Analysis.\u201d Last modified December 1, 2013. http://www.bea.gov/.\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce. \u201cUnited States Census Bureau.\u201d http://www.census.gov/.\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nbalance of trade (trade balance)\n: the gap, if any, between a nation\u2019s exports and imports\n^\n\ncurrent account balance\n: a broad measure of the balance of trade that includes trade in goods and services, as well as international flows of income and foreign aid\n^\n\nmerchandise trade balance\n: the balance of trade looking only at goods\n^\n\nunilateral transfers\n: \u201cone-way payments\u201d made by governments, private entities, or individuals that are sent abroad with nothing received in return", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

As we will see below, a trade deficit necessarily means a net inflow of financial capital from abroad, while a trade surplus necessarily means a net outflow of financial capital from an economy to other countries.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIn what way does comparing a country\u2019s exports to GDP reflect how globalized it is?\n\n\n\nGDP is a dollar value of all production of goods and services. Exports are produced domestically but shipped abroad. The percent ratio of exports to GDP gives us an idea of how important exports are to the national economy out of all goods and services produced. For example, exports represent only 14% of U.S. GDP, but 50% of Germany\u2019s GDP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanada\u2019s GDP is $1,800 billion and its exports are $542 billion. What is Canada\u2019s export ratio?\n\n\n\nDivide $542 billion by $1,800 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GDP for the United States is $16,800 billion and its current account balance is \u2013$400 billion. What percent of GDP is the current account balance?\n\n\n\nDivide \u2013$400 billion by $16,800 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the trade balance and the current account balance track so closely together over time?\n\n\n\nThe trade balance is the difference between exports and imports. The current account balance includes this number (whether it is a trade balance or a trade surplus), but also includes international flows of money from global investments.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Question\n\n\n\nIn recent decades, has the U.S. trade balance usually been in deficit, surplus, or balanced?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nIf a country is a big exporter, is it more exposed to global financial crises?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf countries reduced trade barriers, would the international flows of money increase?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nexports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP\n: the dollar value of exports divided by the dollar value of a country\u2019s GDP", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of **financial capital**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways: a parable of trade between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payments.\n\n### A Two-Person Economy: Robinson Crusoe and Friday\n\nTo understand how economists view trade deficits and surpluses, consider a parable based on the story of Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe, as you may remember from the classic novel by Daniel Defoe first published in 1719, was shipwrecked on a desert island. After living alone for some time, he is joined by a second person, whom he names Friday. Think about the balance of trade in a two-person economy like that of Robinson and Friday.\n\nRobinson and Friday trade goods and services. Perhaps Robinson catches fish and trades them to Friday for coconuts. Or Friday weaves a hat out of tree fronds and trades it to Robinson for help in carrying water. For a period of time, each individual trade is self-contained and complete. Because each trade is voluntary, both Robinson and Friday must feel that they are receiving fair value for what they are giving. As a result, each person\u2019s exports are always equal to his imports, and trade is always in balance between the two. Neither person experiences either a trade deficit or a trade surplus.\n\nHowever, one day Robinson approaches Friday with a proposition. Robinson wants to dig ditches for an irrigation system for his garden, but he knows that if he starts this project, he will not have much time left to fish and gather coconuts to feed himself each day. He proposes that Friday supply him with a certain number of fish and coconuts for several months, and then after that time, he promises to repay Friday out of the extra produce that he will be able to grow in his irrigated garden. If Friday accepts this offer, then a trade imbalance comes into being. For several months, Friday will have a trade surplus: that is, he is exporting to Robinson more than he is importing. More precisely, he is giving Robinson fish and coconuts, and at least for the moment, he is receiving nothing in return. Conversely, Robinson will have a trade deficit, because he is importing more from Friday than he is exporting.\n\nThis parable raises several useful issues in thinking about what a trade deficit and a trade surplus really mean in economic terms. The first issue raised by this story of Robinson and Friday is this: Is it better to have a trade surplus or a trade deficit? The answer, as in any voluntary market interaction, is that if both parties agree to the transaction, then they may both be better off. Over time, if Robinson\u2019s irrigated garden is a success, it is certainly possible that both Robinson and Friday can benefit from this agreement.\n\nA second issue raised by the parable: What can go wrong? Robinson\u2019s proposal to Friday introduces an element of uncertainty. Friday is, in effect, making a loan of fish and coconuts to Robinson, and Friday\u2019s happiness with this arrangement will depend on whether that loan is repaid as planned, in full and on time. Perhaps Robinson spends several months loafing and never builds the irrigation system. Or perhaps Robinson has been too optimistic about how much he will be able to grow with the new irrigation system, which turns out not to be very productive. Perhaps, after building the irrigation system, Robinson decides that he does not want to repay Friday as much as previously agreed. Any of these developments will prompt a new round of negotiations between Friday and Robinson. Friday\u2019s attitude toward these renegotiations is likely to be shaped by why the repayment failed. If Robinson worked very hard and the irrigation system just did not increase production as intended, Friday may have some sympathy. If Robinson loafed or if he just refuses to pay, Friday may become irritated.\n\nA third issue raised by the parable of Robinson and Friday is that an intimate relationship exists between a trade deficit and international borrowing, and between a trade surplus and international lending. The size of Friday\u2019s trade surplus is exactly how much he is lending to Robinson. The size of Robinson\u2019s trade deficit is exactly how much he is borrowing from Friday. Indeed, to economists, a trade surplus literally means the same thing as an outflow of financial capital, and a trade deficit literally means the same thing as an inflow of financial capital. This last insight is worth exploring in greater detail, which we will do in the following section.\n\nThe story of Robinson and Friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of **comparative advantage**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which you learn more about in the [International Trade](/m48818){: .target-chapter} chapter. The following Work It Out feature steps you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the United States and Great Britain in the 1800s.\n\n\n\nCalculating Comparative Advantage\n\nIn the 1800s, the United States and Britain traded wheat and cloth. [\\[link\\]](#Table_23_05) shows the varying hours of labor per unit of output.\n\n<table id=\"Table_23_05\" summary=\"This table has three rows and five columns. The first row is a header row and it labels each column. The second column is labeled &#x201C;Wheat (in bushels)&#x201D;, the third is &#x201C;Cloth (in yards)&#x201D;, the fourth is &#x201C;Relative labor cost of wheat (Pw/Pc)&#x201D;, the fifth is &#x201C;Relative labor cost of cloth (Pc/Pw)&#x201D;. Under the first column are the countries: the United States and Britain. Under the column &#x201C;Wheat (in bushels)&#x201D; are the values 8 and 4.

Under the column &#x201C;Relative labor cost of cloth (Pc/Pw)&#x201D; are the values 9/8 and 3/4.\"><caption /><thead>\n<tr>\n<th />\n<th>Wheat (in bushels)</th>\n<th>Cloth (in yards)</th>\n<th>Relative labor cost of wheat (Pw/Pc)</th>\n<th>Relative labor cost of cloth (Pc/Pw)</th>\n</tr></thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>United States</td>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>8/9</td>\n<td>9/8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Britain</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4/3</td>\n<td>3/4</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\nStep 1. Observe from [\\[link\\]](#Table_23_05) that, in the United States, it takes eight hours to supply a bushel of wheat and nine hours to supply a yard of cloth. In contrast, it takes four hours to supply a bushel of wheat and three hours to supply a yard of cloth in Britain.\n\nStep 2. Recognize the difference between absolute advantage and comparative advantage. Britain has an absolute advantage (lowest cost) in each good, since it takes a lower amount of labor to make each good in Britain. Britain also has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth (lower opportunity cost in cloth (3/4 versus 9/8)). The United States has a comparative advantage in wheat production (lower opportunity cost of 8/9 versus 4/3).\n\nStep 3. Determine the relative price of one good in terms of the other good. The price of wheat, in this example, is the amount of cloth you have to give up. To find this price, convert the hours per unit of wheat and cloth into units per hour. To do so, observe that in the United States it takes eight hours to make a bushel of wheat, so 1/8 of a bushel of wheat can be made in an hour. It takes nine hours to make a yard of cloth in the United States, so 1/9 of a yard of cloth can be made in an hour. If you divide the amount of cloth (1/9 of a yard) by the amount of wheat you give up (1/8 of a bushel) in an hour, you find the price (8/9) of one good (wheat) in terms of the other (cloth).\n\n\n\n### The Balance of Trade as the Balance of Payments\n\nThe connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that the balance of trade is sometimes described as the **balance of payments**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Each category of the current account balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C23_003) shows the flow of goods and services and payments between one country\u2014the United States in this example\u2014and the rest of the world. The top line shows U.S. exports of goods and services, while the second line shows financial payments from purchasers in other countries back to the U.S. economy. The third line then shows U.S. imports of goods, services, and investment, and the fourth line shows payments from the home economy to the rest of the world. Flow of goods and services (lines one and three) show up in the current account, while flow of funds (lines two and four) are found in the financial account.\n\nThe bottom four lines of the [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C23_003) show the flow of investment income. In the first of the bottom lines, we see investments made abroad with funds flowing from the home country to rest of the world. Investment income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country. Similarly, we see on the bottom third line, an investment from rest of the world into the home country and **investment income**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (bottom fourth line) flowing from the home country to the rest of the world. The investment income (bottom lines two and four) are found in the current account, while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country (lines one and three) are found in the financial account. Unilateral transfers, the fourth item in the current account, are not shown in this figure.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C23_003 data-title=\"Flow of Investment Goods and Capital \"}\n\nA current account deficit means that, the country is a net borrower from abroad. Conversely, a positive current account balance means a country is a net lender to the rest of the world. Just like the parable of Robinson and Friday, the lesson is that a trade surplus means an overall outflow of financial investment capital, as domestic investors put their funds abroad, while the deficit in the current account balance is exactly equal to the overall or net inflow of foreign investment capital from abroad.\n\nIt is important to recognize that an inflow and outflow of foreign capital does not necessarily refer to a debt that governments owe to other governments, although government debt may be part of the picture. Instead, these international flows of financial capital refer to all of the ways in which private investors in one country may invest in another country\u2014by buying real estate, companies, and financial investments like stocks and bonds.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nInternational flows of goods and services are closely connected to the international flows of financial capital. A current account deficit means that, after taking all the flows of payments from goods, services, and income together, the country is a net borrower from the rest of the world. A current account surplus is the opposite and means the country is a net lender to the rest of the world.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nState whether each of the following events involves a financial flow to the U.S. economy or away from the U.S. economy:\n\n1.  Export sales to Germany\n2.  Returns being paid on past U.S. financial investments in Brazil\n3.  Foreign aid from the U.S. government to Egypt\n4.  Imported oil from the Russian Federation\n5.  Japanese investors buying U.S. real estate\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  An export sale to Germany involves a financial flow from Germany to the U.S. economy.\n2.  The issue here is not U.S. investments in Brazil, but the return paid on those investments, which involves a financial flow from the Brazilian economy to the U.S. economy.\n3.  Foreign aid from the United States to Egypt is a financial flow from the United States to Egypt.\n4.  Importing oil from the Russian Federation means a flow of financial payments from the U.S. economy to the Russian Federation.\n5.  Japanese investors buying U.S. real estate is a financial flow from Japan to the U.S. economy.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the bottom portion of [[link]](#CNX_Econ_C23_003), showing the international flow of investments and capital, differ from the upper portion?\n\n\n\nThe top portion tracks the flow of exports and imports and the payments for those. The bottom portion is looking at international financial investments and the outflow and inflow of monies from those investments. These investments can include investments in stocks and bonds or real estate abroad, as well as international borrowing and lending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain the relationship between a current account deficit or surplus and the flow of funds.\n\n\n\nIf more monies are flowing out of the country (for example, to pay for imports) it will make the current account more negative or less positive, and if more monies are flowing into the country, it will make the current account less negative or more positive.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Question\n\n\n\nDoes a trade surplus mean an overall inflow of financial capital to an economy, or an overall outflow of financial capital? What about a trade deficit?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question\n\n\n\nIs it better for your country to be an international lender or borrower?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nfinancial capital\n: the international flows of money that facilitates trade and investment", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

This approach views trade balances\u2014and their associated flows of financial capital\u2014in the context of the overall levels of savings and financial investment in the economy.\n\n### Understanding the Determinants of the Trade and Current Account Balance\n\nThe **national saving and investment identity**{: data-type=\"term\"} provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance. In a nation\u2019s **financial capital market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments. What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital? See the following Clear It Up feature for the answer to this question.\n\n\n\nWhat comprises the supply and demand of financial capital?\n\nA country\u2019s national savings is the total of its domestic savings by household and companies (private savings) as well as the government (public savings). If a country is running a trade deficit, it means money from abroad is entering the country and is considered part of the supply of financial capital.\n\nThe demand for financial capital (money) represents groups that are borrowing the money. Businesses need to borrow to finance their investments in factories, materials, and personnel. When the federal government runs a budget deficit, it is also borrowing money from investors by selling Treasury bonds. So both business investment and the federal government can demand (or borrow) the supply of savings.\n\n\n\nThere are two main sources for the supply of financial capital in the U.S. economy: saving by individuals and firms, called S, and the inflow of financial capital from foreign investors, which is equal to the trade deficit (M \u2013 X), or imports minus exports. There are also two main sources of demand for financial capital in the U.S. economy: private sector investment, I, and government borrowing, where the government needs to borrow when government spending, G, is higher than the taxes collected, T. This national savings and investment identity can be expressed in algebraic terms:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Supply\u00a0of\u00a0financial\u00a0capital</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Demand\u00a0for\u00a0financial\u00a0capital</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>S\u00a0+\u00a0(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0X)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>I\u00a0+\u00a0(G\u00a0\u2013\u00a0T)</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nAgain, in this equation, S is private savings, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports, and I is investment. This relationship is true as a matter of definition because, for the macro economy, the quantity supplied of financial capital must be equal to the quantity demanded.\n\nHowever, certain components of the national savings and investment identity can switch between the supply side and the demand side. Some countries, like the United States in most years since the 1970s, have budget deficits, which mean the government is spending more than it collects in taxes, and so the government needs to borrow funds. In this case, the government term would be G \u2013 T &gt; 0, showing that spending is larger than taxes, and the government would be a demander of financial capital on the right-hand side of the equation (that is, a borrower), not a supplier of financial capital on the right-hand side. However, if the government runs a budget surplus so that the taxes exceed spending, as the U.S. government did from 1998 to 2001, then the government in that year was contributing to the supply of financial capital (T \u2013 G &gt; 0), and would appear on the left (saving) side of the national savings and investment identity.\n\nSimilarly, if a national economy runs a trade surplus, the trade sector will involve an outflow of financial capital to other countries. A trade surplus means that the domestic financial capital is in surplus within a country and can be invested in other countries.\n\nThe fundamental notion that total quantity of **financial capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} demanded equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true. Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital. However, the government and trade balance elements of the equation can move back and forth as either suppliers or demanders of financial capital, depending on whether government budgets and the trade balance are in surplus or deficit.\n\n### Domestic Saving and Investment Determine the Trade Balance\n\nOne insight from the national saving and investment identity is that a nation\u2019s balance of trade is determined by that nation\u2019s own levels of domestic saving and domestic investment. To understand this point, rearrange the identity to put the balance of trade all by itself on one side of the equation. Consider first the situation with a trade deficit, and then the situation with a trade surplus.\n\nIn the case of a trade deficit, the national saving and investment identity can be rewritten as:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Trade\u00a0deficit</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Domestic\u00a0investment\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Private\u00a0domestic\u00a0saving\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Government\u00a0(or public) savings</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0X)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>I\u00a0\u2013\u00a0S\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nIn this case, domestic investment is higher than domestic saving, including both private and government saving. The only way that domestic investment can exceed domestic saving is if capital is flowing into a country from abroad. After all, that extra financial capital for investment has to come from someplace.\n\nNow consider a trade *surplus* from the standpoint of the national saving and investment identity:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Trade\u00a0surplus</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Private\u00a0domestic\u00a0saving\u00a0+\u00a0Public\u00a0saving\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Domestic\u00a0investment</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>(X\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>S\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0\u2013\u00a0I</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nIn this case, domestic savings (both private and public) is higher than domestic investment. That extra financial capital will be invested abroad.\n\nThis connection of domestic saving and investment to the trade balance explains why economists view the balance of trade as a fundamentally macroeconomic phenomenon. As the national saving and investment identity shows, the trade balance is not determined by the performance of certain sectors of an economy, like cars or steel. Nor is the trade balance determined by whether the nation\u2019s trade laws and regulations encourage free trade or protectionism (see [Globalization and Protectionism](/m48824){: .target-chapter}).\n\n### Exploring Trade Balances One Factor at a Time\n\nThe national saving and investment identity also provides a framework for thinking about what will cause trade deficits to rise or fall. Begin with the version of the identity that has domestic savings and investment on the left and the trade deficit on the right:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right\"><mtr><mtd><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Domestic\u00a0investment\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Private\u00a0domestic\u00a0savings\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Public\u00a0domestic\u00a0savings</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Trade\u00a0deficit</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>I\u00a0\u2013\u00a0S\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0X)</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nNow, consider the factors on the left-hand side of the equation one at a time, while holding the other factors constant.\n\nAs a first example, assume that the level of domestic investment in a country rises, while the level of private and public saving remains unchanged. The result is shown in the first row of [\\[link\\]](#Table_23_06) under the equation. Since the equality of the national savings and investment identity must continue to hold\u2014it is, after all, an identity that must be true by definition\u2014the rise in domestic investment will mean a higher trade deficit. This situation occurred in the U.S. economy in the late 1990s. Because of the surge of new information and communications technologies that became available, business investment increased substantially. A fall in private saving during this time and a rise in government saving more or less offset each other.

In this case, the trade deficit would decline. As domestic savings rises, there would be less need for foreign financial capital to meet investment needs. For this reason, a policy proposal often made for reducing the U.S. trade deficit is to increase private saving\u2014although exactly how to increase the overall rate of saving has proven controversial.\n\nAs a third scenario, imagine that the government budget deficit increased dramatically, while domestic investment and private savings remained unchanged. This scenario occurred in the U.S. economy in the mid-1980s. The federal budget deficit increased from $79 billion in 1981 to $221 billion in 1986\u2014an increase in the demand for financial capital of $142 billion. The current account balance collapsed from a surplus of $5 billion in 1981 to a deficit of $147 million in 1986\u2014an increase in the supply of financial capital from abroad of $152 billion. The two numbers do not match exactly, since in the real world, private savings and investment did not remain fixed. The connection at that time is clear: a sharp increase in government borrowing increased the U.S. economy\u2019s demand for financial capital, and that increase was primarily supplied by foreign investors through the trade deficit. The following Work It Out feature walks you through a scenario in which private domestic savings has to rise by a certain amount to reduce a trade deficit.\n\n\n\nSolving Problems with the Saving and Investment Identity\n\nUse the saving and investment identity to answer the following question: Country A has a trade deficit of $200 billion, private domestic savings of $500 billion, a government deficit of $200 billion, and private domestic investment of $500 billion.

Summarize the answer: Private domestic savings needs to rise by $100 billion, to a total of $600 billion, for the two sides of the equation to remain equal (\u2013100 = \u2013100).\n\n\n\n### Short-Term Movements in the Business Cycle and the Trade Balance\n\nIn the short run, trade imbalances can be affected by whether an economy is in a recession or on the upswing. A recession tends to make a trade deficit smaller, or a trade surplus larger, while a period of strong economic growth tends to make a trade deficit larger, or a trade surplus smaller.\n\nAs an example, note in [\\[link\\]](/m48733#CNX_Econ_C23_004) that the U.S. trade deficit declined by almost half from 2006 to 2009. One primary reason for this change is that during the recession, as the U.S. economy slowed down, it purchased fewer of all goods, including fewer imports from abroad. However, buying power abroad fell less, and so U.S. exports did not fall by as much.\n\nConversely, in the mid-2000s, when the U.S. trade deficit became very large, a contributing short-term reason is that the U.S. economy was growing. As a result, there was lots of aggressive buying in the U.S. economy, including the buying of imports. Thus, a rapidly growing domestic economy is often accompanied by a trade deficit (or a much lower trade surplus), while a slowing or recessionary domestic economy is accompanied by a trade surplus (or a much lower trade deficit).\n\nWhen the trade deficit rises, it necessarily means a greater net inflow of **foreign financial capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. The national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several different ways. For example, the additional inflow of financial capital from abroad could be offset by reduced private savings, leaving domestic investment and public saving unchanged. Alternatively, the inflow of foreign financial capital could result in higher domestic investment, leaving private and public saving unchanged. Yet another possibility is that the inflow of foreign financial capital could be absorbed by greater government borrowing, leaving domestic saving and investment unchanged. The national saving and investment identity does not specify which of these scenarios, alone or in combination, will occur\u2014only that one of them must occur.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe national saving and investment identity is based on the relationship that the total quantity of financial capital supplied from all sources must equal the total quantity of financial capital demanded from all sources. If S is private saving, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports, and I is investment, then for an economy with a current account deficit and a budget deficit:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Supply\u00a0of\u00a0financial\u00a0capital</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Demand\u00a0for\u00a0financial\u00a0capital</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>S\u00a0+\u2009\u00a0(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0X)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>=</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>I\u00a0+\u2009\u00a0(G\u00a0\u2013\u00a0T)</mtext><mo>\u00a0</mo></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nA recession tends to increase the trade balance (meaning a higher trade surplus or lower trade deficit), while economic boom will tend to decrease the trade balance (meaning a lower trade surplus or a larger trade deficit).\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nUsing the national savings and investment identity, explain how each of the following changes (*ceteris paribus*) will increase or decrease the trade balance:\n\n1.  A lower domestic savings rate\n2.  The government changes from running a budget surplus to running a budget deficit\n3.  The rate of domestic investment surges\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\nWrite out the national savings and investment identity for the situation of the economy implied by this question:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Supply\u00a0of\u00a0capital</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Demand\u00a0for\u00a0capital</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>S\u00a0+\u2009\u00a0(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0X)\u00a0+\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>I</mtext><mo>\u00a0</mo></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Savings\u00a0+\u2009\u00a0(trade\u00a0deficit)\u00a0+\u2009\u00a0(government\u00a0budget\u00a0surplus)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>=</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Investment</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nIf domestic savings increases and nothing else changes, then the trade deficit will fall. In effect, the economy would be relying more on domestic capital and less on foreign capital. If the government starts borrowing instead of saving, then the trade deficit must rise. In effect, the government is no longer providing savings and so, if nothing else is to change, more investment funds must arrive from abroad. If the rate of domestic investment surges, then, *ceteris paribus*, the trade deficit must also rise, to provide the extra capital. The *ceteris paribus*\u2014or \u201cother things being equal\u201d\u2014assumption is important here. In all of these situations, there is no reason to expect in the real world that the original change will affect only, or primarily, the trade deficit. The identity only says that something will adjust\u2014it does not specify what.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a country is running a government budget surplus, why is (T \u2013 G) on the left side of the saving-investment identity?\n\n\n\nThe government is saving rather than borrowing. The supply of savings, whether private or public, is on the left side of the identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat determines the size of a country\u2019s trade deficit?\n\n\n\nA trade deficit is determined by a country\u2019s level of private and public savings and the amount of domestic investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf domestic investment increases, and there is no change in the amount of private and public saving, what must happen to the size of the trade deficit?\n\n\n\nThe trade deficit must increase. To put it another way, this increase in investment must be financed by an inflow of financial capital from abroad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does a recession cause a trade deficit to increase?\n\n\n\nIncomes fall during a recession, and consumers buy fewer good, including imports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the United States and global economies are booming. Will U.S. imports and/or exports increase?\n\n\n\nA booming economy will increase the demand for goods in general, so import sales will increase. If our trading partners\u2019 economies are doing well, they will buy more of our products and so U.S. exports will increase.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are the two main sides of the national savings and investment identity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the main components of the national savings and investment identity?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nMany think that the size of a trade deficit is due to a lack of competitiveness of domestic sectors, such as autos. Explain why this is not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you observed a country with a rapidly growing trade surplus over a period of a year or so, would you be more likely to believe that the economy of that country was in a period of recession or of rapid growth? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom time to time, a government official will argue that a country should strive for both a trade surplus and a healthy inflow of capital from abroad. Is this possible?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nImagine that the U.S. economy finds itself in the following situation: a government budget deficit of $100 billion, total domestic savings of $1,500 billion, and total domestic physical capital investment of $1,600 billion. According to the national saving and investment identity, what will be the current account balance? What will be the current account balance if investment rises by $50 billion, while the budget deficit and national savings remain the same?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[link]](#Table_23_07) provides some hypothetical data on macroeconomic accounts for three countries represented by A, B, and C and measured in billions of currency units.

The question of whether trade deficits or surpluses are good or bad for an economy is, in economic terms, exactly the same question as whether it is a good idea for an economy to rely on net inflows of financial capital from abroad or to make net investments of financial capital abroad. Conventional wisdom often holds that borrowing money is foolhardy, and that a prudent country, like a prudent person, should always rely on its own resources. While it is certainly possible to borrow too much\u2014as anyone with an overloaded credit card can testify\u2014borrowing at certain times can also make sound economic sense. For both individuals and countries, there is no economic merit in a policy of abstaining from participation in financial capital markets.\n\nIt makes economic sense to borrow when you are buying something with a long-run payoff; that is, when you are making an investment. For this reason, it can make economic sense to borrow for a college education, because the education will typically allow you to earn higher wages, and so to repay the loan and still come out ahead. It can also make sense for a business to borrow in order to purchase a machine that will last 10 years, as long as the machine will increase output and profits by more than enough to repay the loan. Similarly, it can make economic sense for a national economy to borrow from abroad, as long as the money is wisely invested in ways that will tend to raise the nation\u2019s economic growth over time. Then, it will be possible for the national economy to repay the borrowed money over time and still end up better off than before.\n\nOne vivid example of a country that borrowed heavily from abroad, invested wisely, and did perfectly well is the United States during the nineteenth century. The United States ran a trade deficit in 40 of the 45 years from 1831 to 1875, which meant that it was importing capital from abroad over that time. However, that financial capital was, by and large, invested in projects like railroads that brought a substantial economic payoff. (See the following Clear It Up feature for more on this.)\n\nA more recent example along these lines is the experience of South Korea, which had trade deficits during much of the 1970s\u2014and so was an importer of capital over that time. However, South Korea also had high rates of investment in physical plant and equipment, and its economy grew rapidly. From the mid-1980s into the mid-1990s, South Korea often had trade surpluses\u2014that is, it was repaying its past borrowing by sending capital abroad.\n\nIn contrast, some countries have run large trade deficits, borrowed heavily in global capital markets, and ended up in all kinds of trouble. Two specific sorts of trouble are worth examining. First, a borrower nation can find itself in a bind if the incoming funds from abroad are not invested in a way that leads to increased productivity. Several of the large economies of Latin America, including Mexico and Brazil, ran large trade deficits and borrowed heavily from abroad in the 1970s, but the inflow of financial capital did not boost productivity sufficiently, which meant that these countries faced enormous troubles repaying the money borrowed when economic conditions shifted during the 1980s. Similarly, it appears that a number of African nations that borrowed foreign funds in the 1970s and 1980s did not invest in productive economic assets. As a result, several of those countries later faced large interest payments, with no economic growth to show for the borrowed funds.\n\n\n\nAre trade deficits always harmful?\n\nFor most years of the nineteenth century, U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit. Yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all; instead, the trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highest **per capita GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} in the world by around 1900.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficits meant that the U.S. economy was receiving a net inflow of foreign capital from abroad. Much of that foreign capital flowed into two areas of investment\u2014railroads and public infrastructure like roads, water systems, and schools\u2014which were important to helping the growth of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe effect of foreign investment capital on U.S. economic growth should not be overstated. In most years the foreign financial capital represented no more than 6\u201310% of the funds used for overall physical investment in the economy. Nonetheless, the trade deficit and the accompanying investment funds from abroad were clearly a help, not a hindrance, to the U.S. economy in the nineteenth century.\n\n\n\nA second \u201ctrouble\u201d is: What happens if the foreign money flows in, and then suddenly flows out again? This scenario was raised at the start of the chapter. In the mid-1990s, a number of countries in East Asia\u2014Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea\u2014ran large trade deficits and imported capital from abroad. However, in 1997 and 1998 many foreign investors became concerned about the health of these economies, and quickly pulled their money out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks. The extremely rapid departure of that foreign capital staggered the banking systems and economies of these countries, plunging them into deep recession. We investigate and discuss the links between international capital flows, banks, and recession in [The Impacts of Government Borrowing](/m48800){: .target-chapter}.\n\nWhile a trade deficit is not always harmful, there is no guarantee that running a trade surplus will bring robust economic health. For example, Germany and Japan ran substantial trade surpluses for most of the last three decades. Regardless of their persistent trade surpluses, both countries have experienced occasional recessions and neither country has had especially robust annual growth in recent years. Read more about Japan\u2019s trade surplus in the next Clear It Up feature.\n\n\nWatch this [video][1] on whether or not trade deficit is good for the economy.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nThe sheer size and persistence of the U.S. trade deficits and inflows of foreign capital since the 1980s are a legitimate cause for concern. The huge U.S. economy will not be destabilized by an outflow of international capital as easily as, say, the comparatively tiny economies of Thailand and Indonesia were in 1997\u20131998. Even an economy that is not knocked down, however, can still be shaken. American policymakers should certainly be paying attention to those cases where a pattern of extensive and sustained current account deficits and foreign borrowing has gone badly\u2014if only as a cautionary tale.\n\n\n\nAre trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Japan since the 1990s.\n\nPerhaps no economy around the world is better known for its trade surpluses than Japan. Since 1990, the size of these surpluses has often been near $100 billion per year. When Japan\u2019s economy was growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s, its large trade surpluses were often described, especially by non-economists, as either a cause or a result of its robust economic health. But from a standpoint of economic growth, Japan\u2019s economy has been teetering in and out of recession since 1990, with **real GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} growth averaging only about 1% per year, and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher. Clearly, a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health.\n\nInstead, Japan\u2019s trade surplus reflects that Japan has a very high rate of domestic savings, more than the Japanese economy can invest domestically, and so the extra funds are invested abroad. In Japan\u2019s slow economy, the growth of consumption is relatively low, which also means that consumption of imports is relatively low. Thus, Japan\u2019s exports continually exceed its imports, leaving the trade surplus continually high. Recently, Japan\u2019s trade surpluses began to deteriorate. In 2013, Japan ran a trade deficit due to the high cost of imported oil.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nTrade surpluses are no guarantee of economic health, and trade deficits are no guarantee of economic weakness. Either trade deficits or trade surpluses can work out well or poorly, depending on whether the corresponding flows of financial capital are wisely invested.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nFor each of the following, indicate which type of government spending would justify a budget deficit and which would not.\n\n1.  Increased federal spending on Medicare\n2.  Increased spending on education\n3.  Increased spending on the space program\n4.  Increased spending on airports and air traffic control\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  Increased federal spending on Medicare may not increase productivity, so a budget deficit is not justified.\n2.  Increased spending on education will increase productivity and foster greater economic growth, so a budget deficit is justified.\n3.  Increased spending on the space program may not increase productivity, so a budget deficit is not justified.\n4.  Increased spending on airports and air traffic control will increase productivity and foster greater economic growth, so a budget deficit is justified.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did large trade deficits hurt the East Asian countries in the mid 1980\u2019s? (Recall that trade deficits are equivalent to inflows of financial capital from abroad.)\n\n\n\nForeign investors worried about repayment so they began to pull money out of these countries. The money can be pulled out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe a scenario in which a trade surplus benefits an economy and one in which a trade surplus is occurring in an economy that performs poorly. What key factor or factors are making the difference in the outcome that results from a trade surplus?\n\n\n\nA rapidly growing trade surplus could result from a number of factors, so you would not want to be too quick to assume a specific cause. However, if the choice is between whether the economy is in recession or growing rapidly, the answer would have to be recession. In a recession, demand for all goods, including imports, has declined; however, demand for exports from other countries has not necessarily altered much, so the result is a larger trade surplus.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhen is a trade deficit likely to work out well for an economy? When is it likely to work out poorly?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes a trade surplus help to guarantee strong economic growth?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question\n\n\n\nWhat is more important, a country\u2019s current account balance or the growth of GDP? Why?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nTabuchi, Hiroko. \u201cJapan Reports a $78 Billion Trade Deficit for 2012.\u201d *The New York Times*, January 23, 2013. http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/business/global/japan-reports-a-78-billion-trade-deficit-for-2012.html?\\\\\\_r=0.\n\nWorld Bank. 2014. \\\"Exports of Goods and Services (% of GDP).\\\" Accesed April 13, 2015. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NE.EXP.GNFS.ZS/countries.\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/tradedeficit", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high **level of trade**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\u2014measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP\u2014while it also has a near-balance between exports and imports. A high level of trade indicates that a good portion of the nation\u2019s production is exported. It is also possible for a country\u2019s trade to be a relatively low share of GDP, relative to global averages, but for the imbalance between its exports and its imports to be quite large. This general theme was emphasized earlier in [Measuring Trade Balances](/m48732), which offered some illustrative figures on trade levels and balances.\n\nA country\u2019s level of trade tells how much of its production it exports. This is measured by the percent of exports out of GDP. It indicates how globalized an economy is. Some countries, such as Germany, have a high level of trade\u2014they export almost 50% of their total production. The balance of trade tells us if the country is running a trade surplus or trade deficit. A country can have a low level of trade but a high trade deficit. (For example, the United States only exports 14% of GDP, but it has a trade deficit of $540 billion.)\n\nThree factors strongly influence a nation\u2019s level of trade: the size of its economy, its geographic location, and its history of trade. Large economies like the United States can do much of their trading internally, while small economies like Sweden have less ability to provide what they want internally and tend to have higher ratios of exports and imports to GDP. Nations that are neighbors tend to trade more, since costs of transportation and communication are lower. Moreover, some nations have long and established patterns of international trade, while others do not.\n\nConsequently, a relatively small economy like Sweden, with many nearby trading partners across Europe and a long history of foreign trade, has a high level of trade. Brazil and India, which are fairly large economies that have often sought to inhibit trade in recent decades, have lower levels of trade. Whereas, the United States and Japan are extremely large economies that have comparatively few nearby trading partners. Both countries actually have quite low levels of trade by world standards. The ratio of exports to GDP in either the United States or in Japan is about half of the world average.\n\nThe **balance of trade**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is a separate issue from the level of trade. The United States has a low level of trade, but had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into the 2000s. Japan has a low level of trade by world standards, but has typically shown large trade surpluses in recent decades. Nations like Germany and the United Kingdom have medium to high levels of trade by world standards, but Germany had a moderate trade surplus in 2008, while the United Kingdom had a moderate trade deficit. Their trade picture was roughly in balance in the late 1990s. Sweden had a high level of trade and a large trade surplus in 2007, while Mexico had a high level of trade and a moderate trade deficit that same year.\n\nIn short, it is quite possible for nations with a relatively low level of trade, expressed as a percentage of GDP, to have relatively large trade deficits. It is also quite possible for nations with a near balance between exports and imports to worry about the consequences of high levels of trade for the economy. It is not inconsistent to believe that a high level of trade is potentially beneficial to an economy, because of the way it allows nations to play to their comparative advantages, and to also be concerned about any macroeconomic instability caused by a long-term pattern of large trade deficits. The following Clear It Up feature discusses how this sort of dynamic played out in Colonial India.\n\n\n\nAre trade surpluses always beneficial? Considering Colonial India.\n\nIndia was formally under British rule from 1858 to 1947. During that time, India consistently had trade surpluses with Great Britain. Anyone who believes that trade surpluses are a sign of economic strength and dominance while trade deficits are a sign of economic weakness must find this pattern odd, since it would mean that colonial India was successfully dominating and exploiting Great Britain for almost a century\u2014which was not true.\n\nInstead, India\u2019s trade surpluses with Great Britain meant that each year there was an overall flow of financial capital from India to Great Britain. In India, this flow of financial capital was heavily criticized as the \u201cdrain,\u201d and eliminating the drain of financial capital was viewed as one of the many reasons why India would benefit from achieving independence.\n\n\n\n### Final Thoughts about Trade Balances\n\nTrade deficits can be a good or a bad sign for an economy, and trade surpluses can be a good or a bad sign. Even a trade balance of zero\u2014which just means that a nation is neither a net borrower nor lender in the international economy\u2014can be either a good or bad sign. The fundamental economic question is not whether a nation\u2019s economy is borrowing or lending at all, but whether the particular borrowing or lending in the particular economic conditions of that country makes sense.\n\nIt is interesting to reflect on how public attitudes toward trade deficits and surpluses might change if we could somehow change the labels that people and the news media affix to them. If a trade deficit was called \u201cattracting foreign financial capital\u201d\u2014which accurately describes what a trade deficit means\u2014then trade deficits might look more attractive. Conversely, if a trade surplus were called \u201cshipping financial capital abroad\u201d\u2014which accurately captures what a trade surplus does\u2014then trade surpluses might look less attractive. Either way, the key to understanding trade balances is to understand the relationships between flows of trade and flows of international payments, and what these relationships imply about the causes, benefits, and risks of different kinds of trade balances. The first step along this journey of understanding is to move beyond knee-jerk reactions to terms like \u201ctrade surplus,\u201d \u201ctrade balance,\u201d and \u201ctrade deficit.\u201d\n\n\n\nMore than Meets the Eye in the Congo\n\nNow that you see the big picture, you undoubtedly realize that all of the economic choices you make, such as depositing savings or investing in an international mutual fund, do influence the flow of goods and services as well as the flows of money around the world.\n\nYou now know that a trade surplus does not necessarily tell us whether an economy is doing well or not. The Democratic Republic of Congo ran a trade surplus in 2013, as we learned in the beginning of the chapter. Yet its current account balance was \u2013$2.8 billion. However, the return of political stability and the rebuilding in the aftermath of the civil war there has meant a flow of investment and financial capital into the country. In this case, a negative current account balance means the country is being rebuilt\u2014and that is a good thing.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThere is a difference between the level of a country\u2019s trade and the balance of trade. The level of trade is measured by the percentage of exports out of GDP, or the size of the economy. Small economies that have nearby trading partners and a history of international trade will tend to have higher levels of trade. Larger economies with few nearby trading partners and a limited history of international trade will tend to have lower levels of trade. The level of trade is different from the trade balance. The level of trade depends on a country\u2019s history of trade, its geography, and the size of its economy. A country\u2019s balance of trade is the dollar difference between its exports and imports.\n\nTrade deficits and trade surpluses are not necessarily good or bad\u2014it depends on the circumstances. Even if a country is borrowing, if that money is invested in productivity-boosting investments it can lead to an improvement in long-term economic growth.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nThe United States exports 14% of GDP while Germany exports about 50% of its GDP. Explain what that means.\n\n\n\nGermany has a higher level of trade than the United States. The United States has a large domestic economy so it has a large volume of internal trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain briefly whether each of the following would be more likely to lead to a higher level of trade for an economy, or a greater imbalance of trade for an economy.\n\n1.  Living in an especially large country\n2.  Having a domestic investment rate much higher than the domestic savings rate\n3.  Having many other large economies geographically nearby\n4.  Having an especially large budget deficit\n5.  Having countries with a tradition of strong protectionist legislation shutting out imports\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  A large economy tends to have lower levels of international trade, because it can do more of its trade internally, but this has little impact on its trade imbalance.\n2.  An imbalance between domestic physical investment and domestic saving (including government and private saving) will always lead to a trade imbalance, but has little to do with the level of trade.\n3.  Many large trading partners nearby geographically increases the level of trade, but has little impact one way or the other on a trade imbalance.\n4.  The answer here is not obvious. An especially large budget deficit means a large demand for financial capital which, according to the national saving and investment identity, makes it somewhat more likely that there will be a need for an inflow of foreign capital, which means a trade deficit.\n5.  A strong tradition of discouraging trade certainly reduces the level of trade. However, it does not necessarily say much about the balance of trade, since this is determined by both imports and exports, and by national levels of physical investment and savings.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat three factors will determine whether a nation has a higher or lower share of trade relative to its GDP?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between trade deficits and balance of trade?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWill nations that are more involved in foreign trade tend to have higher trade imbalances, lower trade imbalances, or is the pattern unpredictable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome economists warn that the persistent trade deficits and a negative current account balance that the United States has run will be a problem in the long run.

Between 1990 and 2006, the U.S. housing market grew. Homeownership rates grew from 64% to a high of over 69% between 2004 and 2005. For many people, this was a period in which they could either buy first homes or buy a larger and more expensive home. During this time mortgage values tripled. Housing became more accessible to Americans and was considered to be a safe financial investment. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_017) shows how new single family home sales peaked in 2005 at 107,000 units.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C24_017 data-title=\"New Single Family Houses Sold\"}\n\n\nThe housing bubble began to show signs of bursting in 2005, as delinquency and late payments began to grow and an oversupply of new homes on the market became apparent. Dropping home values contributed to a decrease in the overall wealth of the household sector and caused homeowners to pull back on spending. Several mortgage lenders were forced to file for bankruptcy because homeowners were not making their payments, and by 2008 the problem had spread throughout the financial markets. Lenders clamped down on credit and the housing bubble burst. Financial markets were now in crisis and unable or unwilling to even extend credit to credit-worthy customers.\n\nThe housing bubble and the crisis in the financial markets were major contributors to the Great Recession that led to unemployment rates over 10% and falling GDP. While the United States is still recovering from the impact of the Great Recession, it has made substantial progress in restoring financial market stability through the implementation of aggressive fiscal and monetary policy.\n\nThe economic history of the United States is cyclical in nature with recessions and expansions. Some of these fluctuations are severe, such as the economic downturn experienced during Great Depression of the 1930\u2019s which lasted several years. Why does the economy grow at different rates in different years? What are the causes of the cyclical behavior of the economy? This chapter will introduce an important model, the aggregate demand\u2013aggregate supply model, to begin our understanding of why economies expand and contract over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to the Aggregate Supply\u2013Aggregate Demand Model\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Macroeconomic Perspectives on Demand and Supply\n* Building a Model of Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand\n* Shifts in Aggregate Supply\n* Shifts in Aggregate Demand\n* How the AS\u2013AD Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation\n* Keynes\u2019 Law and Say\u2019s Law in the AS\u2013AD Model\n\n\n\nA key part of macroeconomics is the use of models to analyze macro issues and problems. How is the rate of economic growth connected to changes in the unemployment rate? Is there a reason why **unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **inflation**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} seem to move in opposite directions: lower unemployment and higher inflation from 1997 to 2000, higher unemployment and lower inflation in the early 2000s, lower unemployment and higher inflation in the mid-2000s, and then higher unemployment and lower inflation in 2009? Why did the current account deficit rise so high, but then decline in 2009?\n\nTo analyze questions like these, we must move beyond discussing macroeconomic issues one at a time, and begin building economic models that will capture the relationships and interconnections between them. The next three chapters take up this task. This chapter introduces the macroeconomic model of **aggregate supply**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **aggregate demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, how the two interact to reach a macroeconomic equilibrium, and how shifts in aggregate demand or aggregate supply will affect that equilibrium. This chapter also relates the model of aggregate supply and aggregate demand to the three goals of economic policy (growth, unemployment, and inflation), and provides a framework for thinking about many of the connections and tradeoffs between these goals.

{"module_id": "m48740", "module_title": "Economics - m48740", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48740", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Explain Say\u2019s Law and determine whether it applies in the short run or the long run\n* Explain Keynes\u2019 Law and determine whether it applies in the short run or the long run\n\n\n\nMacroeconomists over the last two centuries have often divided into two groups: those who argue that supply is the most important determinant of the size of the macroeconomy while demand just tags along, and those who argue that demand is the most important factor in the size of the macroeconomy while supply just tags along.\n\n### Say\u2019s Law and the Macroeconomics of Supply   {#ch24mod01_01}\n\nThose economists who emphasize the role of supply in the macroeconomy often refer to the work of a famous French economist of the early nineteenth century named **Jean-Baptiste Say**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (1767\u20131832). **Say\u2019s law**{: data-type=\"term\"} is: \u201cSupply creates its own demand.\u201d As a matter of historical accuracy, it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs, but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view.\n\nThe intuition behind Say\u2019s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold, it generates income that is earned for someone: a worker, a manager, an owner, or those who are workers, managers, and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production. The forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices to rise and fall. The bottom line remains, however, that every sale represents income to someone, and so, Say\u2019s law argues, a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy. Because Jean-Baptiste Say, **Adam Smith**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as \u201cclassical\u201d economists, modern economists who generally subscribe to the Say\u2019s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy are called **neoclassical economists**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nIf **supply**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level, then (as Say himself recognized) it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur. To be sure, even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand, the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses. Nevertheless, a **recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is not a situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes. A recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size, business failures outnumber the remaining success stories, and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers.\n\nSay\u2019s law that supply creates its own **demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} does seem a good approximation for the long run. Over periods of some years or decades, as the productive power of an economy to supply goods and services increases, total demand in the economy grows at roughly the same pace. However, over shorter time horizons of a few months or even years, recessions or even depressions occur in which firms, as a group, seem to face a lack of demand for their products.\n\n### Keynes\u2019 Law and the Macroeconomics of Demand   {#ch24mod01_02}\n\nThe alternative to Say\u2019s law, with its emphasis on supply, can be named **Keynes\u2019 law**{: data-type=\"term\"}\\: \u201cDemand creates its own supply.\u201d As a matter of historical accuracy, just as Jean-Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say\u2019s law, **John Maynard Keynes**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} never wrote down Keynes\u2019 law, but the law is a useful simplification that conveys a certain point of view.\n\nWhen Keynes wrote his great work *The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money* during the **Great Depression**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of the 1930s, he pointed out that during the Depression, the capacity of the economy to supply goods and services had not changed much. U.S. unemployment rates soared higher than 20% from 1933 to 1935, but the number of possible workers had not increased or decreased much. Factories were closed and shuttered, but machinery and equipment had not disappeared. Technologies that had been invented in the 1920s were not un-invented and forgotten in the 1930s. Thus, Keynes argued that the Great Depression\u2014and many ordinary recessions as well\u2014were not caused by a drop in the ability of the economy to supply goods as measured by labor, physical capital, or technology. He argued the economy often produced less than its full potential, not because it was technically impossible to produce more with the existing workers and machines, but because a lack of demand in the economy as a whole led to inadequate incentives for firms to produce. In such cases, he argued, the level of GDP in the economy was not primarily determined by the potential of what the economy could supply, but rather by the amount of total demand.\n\nKeynes\u2019 law seems to apply fairly well in the short run of a few months to a few years, when many firms experience either a drop in demand for their output during a recession or so much demand that they have trouble producing enough during an economic boom. However, demand cannot tell the whole macroeconomic story, either. After all, if demand was all that mattered at the macroeconomic level, then the government could make the economy as large as it wanted just by pumping up total demand through a large increase in the government spending component or by legislating large tax cuts to push up the consumption component. Economies do, however, face genuine limits to how much they can produce, limits determined by the quantity of labor, physical capital, technology, and the institutional and market structures that bring these factors of production together. These constraints on what an economy can supply at the macroeconomic level do not disappear just because of an increase in demand.\n\n### Combining Supply and Demand in Macroeconomics   {#ch24mod01_03}\n\nTwo insights emerge from this overview of Say\u2019s law with its emphasis on macroeconomic supply and Keynes\u2019 law with its emphasis on macroeconomic demand. The first conclusion, which is not exactly a hot news flash, is that an economic approach focused only on the supply side or only on the demand side can be only a partial success. Both supply and demand need to be taken into account. The second conclusion is that since Keynes\u2019 law applies more accurately in the short run and Say\u2019s law applies more accurately in the long run, the tradeoffs and connections between the three goals of macroeconomics may be different in the short run and the long run.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch24mod01_summ}\n\nNeoclassical economists emphasize Say\u2019s law, which holds that supply creates its own demand. Keynesian economists emphasize Keynes\u2019 law, which holds that demand creates its own supply. Many mainstream economists take a Keynesian perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate demand, for the short run, and a neoclassical perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate supply, for the long run.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch24mod01_sques}\n\n\n\nDescribe the mechanism by which supply creates its own demand.\n\n\n\nIn order to supply goods, suppliers must employ workers, whose incomes increase as a result of their labor. They use this additional income to demand goods of an equivalent value to those they supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the mechanism by which demand creates its own supply.\n\n\n\nWhen consumers demand more goods than are available on the market, prices are driven higher and the additional opportunities for profit induce more suppliers to enter the market, producing an equivalent amount to that which is demanded.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch24mod01_rques}\n\n\n\nWhat is Say\u2019s law?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Keynes\u2019 law?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo neoclassical economists believe in Keynes\u2019 law or Say\u2019s law?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Say\u2019s law apply more accurately in the long run or the short run?

This model is called the **aggregate demand/aggregate supply model**{: data-type=\"term\"}. This module will explain aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the equilibrium between them. The following modules will discuss the causes of shifts in aggregate supply and aggregate demand.\n\n### The Aggregate Supply Curve and Potential GDP   {#ch24mod02_01}\n\nFirms make decisions about what quantity to supply based on the profits they expect to earn. Profits, in turn, are also determined by the price of the outputs the firm sells and by the price of the inputs, like labor or raw materials, the firm needs to buy. **Aggregate supply (AS)**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) firms will produce and sell. The **aggregate supply (AS) curve**{: data-type=\"term\"} shows the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) that firms will produce and sell at each price level.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_001) shows an aggregate supply curve. In the following paragraphs, we will walk through the elements of the diagram one at a time: the horizontal and vertical axes, the aggregate supply curve itself, and the meaning of the potential GDP vertical line.\n\n  slopes up, because as the price level for outputs rises, with the price of inputs remaining fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more and to earn higher profits. The potential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy can produce with full employment of workers and physical capital.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C24_001 data-title=\"The Aggregate Supply Curve\"}\n\nThe horizontal axis of the diagram shows real GDP\u2014that is, the level of GDP adjusted for inflation. The vertical axis shows the price level. Remember that the price level is different from the inflation rate. Visualize the price level as an index number, like the GDP deflator, while the inflation rate is the percentage change between price levels over time.\n\nAs the price level (the average price of all goods and services produced in the economy) rises, the aggregate quantity of goods and services supplied rises as well. Why? The price level shown on the vertical axis represents prices for final goods or outputs bought in the economy\u2014like the GDP deflator\u2014not the price level for intermediate goods and services that are inputs to production. Thus, the AS curve describes how suppliers will react to a higher price level for final outputs of goods and services, while holding the prices of inputs like labor and energy constant. If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising, but their costs of production are not rising, then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production.\n\nThe slope of an AS curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right. At the far left of the aggregate supply curve, the level of output in the economy is far below **potential GDP**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is defined as the quantity that an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor, physical capital, and technology, in the context of its existing market and legal institutions. At these relatively low levels of output, levels of unemployment are high, and many factories are running only part-time, or have closed their doors. In this situation, a relatively small increase in the prices of the outputs that businesses sell\u2014while making the assumption of no rise in input prices\u2014can encourage a considerable surge in the quantity of aggregate supply because so many workers and factories are ready to swing into production.\n\nAs the quantity produced increases, however, certain firms and industries will start running into limits: perhaps nearly all of the expert workers in a certain industry will have jobs or factories in certain geographic areas or industries will be running at full speed. In the intermediate area of the AS curve, a higher price level for outputs continues to encourage a greater quantity of output\u2014but as the increasingly steep upward slope of the aggregate supply curve shows, the increase in quantity in response to a given rise in the price level will not be quite as large. (Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn why the AS curve crosses potential GDP.)\n\n\n\nWhy does AS cross potential GDP?\n\nThe aggregate supply curve is typically drawn to cross the potential GDP line. This shape may seem puzzling: How can an economy produce at an output level which is higher than its \u201cpotential\u201d or \u201cfull employment\u201d GDP? The economic intuition here is that if prices for outputs were high enough, producers would make fanatical efforts to produce: all workers would be on double-overtime, all machines would run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Such hyper-intense production would go beyond using potential labor and physical capital resources fully, to using them in a way that is not sustainable in the long term. Thus, it is indeed possible for production to sprint above potential GDP, but only in the short run.\n\n\n\nAt the far right, the aggregate supply curve becomes nearly vertical. At this quantity, higher prices for outputs cannot encourage additional output, because even if firms want to expand output, the inputs of labor and machinery in the economy are fully employed. In this example, the vertical line in the exhibit shows that potential GDP occurs at a total output of 9,500. When an economy is operating at its potential GDP, machines and factories are running at capacity, and the unemployment rate is relatively low\u2014at the natural rate of unemployment. For this reason, potential GDP is sometimes also called **full-employment GDP**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\n### The Aggregate Demand Curve   {#ch24mod02_02}\n\n**Aggregate demand (AD)**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy. (Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. This distinction will be further explained in the appendix [The Expenditure-Output Model ](/m48835). For now, just think of aggregate demand as total spending.) It includes all four components of demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports). This demand is determined by a number of factors, but one of them is the price level\u2014recall though, that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the average price of the things we buy. The **aggregate demand (AD) curve**{: data-type=\"term\"} shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_002) presents an aggregate demand (AD) curve. Just like the aggregate supply curve, the horizontal axis shows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level. The AD curve slopes down, which means that increases in the price level of outputs lead to a lower quantity of total spending. The reasons behind this shape are related to how changes in the price level affect the different components of aggregate demand. The following components make up aggregate demand: consumption spending (C), investment spending (I), government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M): C + I + G + X \u2013 M.\n\n slopes down, showing that, as the price level rises, the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services declines.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C24_002 data-title=\"The Aggregate Demand Curve\"}\n\nThe wealth effect holds that as the price level increases, the buying power of savings that people have stored up in bank accounts and other assets will diminish, eaten away to some extent by inflation. Because a rise in the price level reduces people\u2019s wealth, consumption spending will fall as the price level rises.\n\nThe interest rate effect is that as prices for outputs rise, the same purchases will take more money or credit to accomplish. This additional demand for money and credit will push interest rates higher. In turn, higher interest rates will reduce borrowing by businesses for investment purposes and reduce borrowing by households for homes and cars\u2014thus reducing consumption and investment spending.\n\nThe foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other countries, then goods in the United States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world. U.S. **exports**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} will be relatively more expensive, and the quantity of exports sold will fall. U.S. **imports**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} from abroad will be relatively cheaper, so the quantity of imports will rise. Thus, a higher domestic price level, relative to price levels in other countries, will reduce net export expenditures.\n\nTruth be told, among economists all three of these effects are controversial, in part because they do not seem to be very large. For this reason, the aggregate demand curve in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_002) slopes downward fairly steeply; the steep slope indicates that a higher price level for final outputs reduces aggregate demand for all three of these reasons, but that the change in the quantity of aggregate demand as a result of changes in price level is not very large.\n\nRead the following Work It Out feature to learn how to interpret the AD/AS model. In this example, aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the price level are given for the imaginary country of Xurbia.\n\n\n\nInterpreting the AD/AS Model\n\n[\\[link\\]](#ch24mod02_tab01) shows information on aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the price level for the imaginary country of Xurbia.

Look at [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_016) which provides a visual to aid in your analysis.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C24_016 data-title=\"The AD/AS Curves\"}\n\n\nStep 5. Determine where AD and AS intersect. This is the equilibrium with price level at 130 and real GDP at $680.\n\nStep 6. Look at the graph to determine where equilibrium is located. We can see that this equilibrium is fairly far from where the AS curve becomes near-vertical (or at least quite steep) which seems to start at about $750 of real output. This implies that the economy is not close to potential GDP. Thus, unemployment will be high. In the relatively flat part of the AS curve, where the equilibrium occurs, changes in the price level will not be a major concern, since such changes are likely to be small.\n\nStep 7. Determine what the steep portion of the AS curve indicates. Where the AS curve is steep, the economy is at or close to potential GDP.\n\nStep 8. Draw conclusions from the given information:\n\n* If equilibrium occurs in the flat range of AS, then economy is not close to potential GDP and will be experiencing unemployment, but stable price level.\n* If equilibrium occurs in the steep range of AS, then the economy is close or at potential GDP and will be experiencing rising price levels or inflationary pressures, but will have a low unemployment rate.\n\n\n\n### Equilibrium in the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model   {#ch24mod02_03}\n\nThe intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves shows the equilibrium level of real GDP and the equilibrium price level in the economy. At a relatively low price level for output, firms have little incentive to produce, although consumers would be willing to purchase a high quantity. As the price level for outputs rises, aggregate supply rises and aggregate demand falls until the equilibrium point is reached.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_003) combines the AS curve from [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_001) and the AD curve from [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_002) and places them both on a single diagram. In this example, the equilibrium point occurs at point E, at a price level of 90 and an output level of 8,800.\n\n  equals aggregate demand (AD), occurs at a price level of 90 and an output level of 8,800.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C24_003 data-title=\"Aggregate Supply and Aggregate Demand\"}\n\nConfusion sometimes arises between the aggregate supply and aggregate demand model and the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital. Read the following Clear It Up feature to gain an understanding of whether AS and AD are macro or micro.\n\n\n\nAre AS and AD macro or micro?\n\nThese aggregate supply and aggregate demand model and the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital have a superficial resemblance, but they also have many underlying differences.\n\nFor example, the vertical and horizontal axes have distinctly different meanings in macroeconomic and microeconomic diagrams. The vertical axis of a microeconomic demand and supply diagram expresses a price (or wage or rate of return) for an individual good or service. This price is implicitly relative: it is intended to be compared with the prices of other products (for example, the price of pizza relative to the price of fried chicken). In contrast, the vertical axis of an aggregate supply and aggregate demand diagram expresses the level of a price index like the Consumer Price Index or the GDP deflator\u2014combining a wide array of prices from across the economy. The price level is absolute: it is not intended to be compared to any other prices since it is essentially the average price of all products in an economy. The horizontal axis of a microeconomic supply and demand curve measures the quantity of a particular good or service. In contrast, the horizontal axis of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram measures GDP, which is the sum of all the final goods and services produced in the economy, not the quantity in a specific market.\n\nIn addition, the economic reasons for the shapes of the curves in the macroeconomic model are different from the reasons behind the shapes of the curves in microeconomic models. Demand curves for individual goods or services slope down primarily because of the existence of substitute goods, not the wealth effects, interest rate, and foreign price effects associated with aggregate demand curves. The slopes of individual supply and demand curves can have a variety of different slopes, depending on the extent to which quantity demanded and quantity supplied react to price in that specific market, but the slopes of the AS and AD curves are much the same in every diagram (although as we shall see in later chapters, short-run and long-run perspectives will emphasize different parts of the AS curve).\n\nIn short, just because the AD/AS diagram has two lines that cross, do not assume that it is the same as every other diagram where two lines cross. The intuitions and meanings of the macro and micro diagrams are only distant cousins from different branches of the economics family tree.\n\n\n\n### Defining SRAS and LRAS   {#eip-631}\n\nIn the Clear It Up feature titled \u201cWhy does AS cross potential GDP?\u201d we differentiated between short run changes in aggregate supply which are shown by the AS curve and long run changes in aggregate supply which are defined by the vertical line at potential GDP. In the short run, if demand is too low (or too high), it is possible for producers to supply less GDP (or more GDP) than potential. In the long run, however, producers are limited to producing at potential GDP. For this reason, what we have been calling the AS curve, will from this point on may also be referred to as the **short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the **long run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch24mod02_summ}\n\nThe upward-sloping short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the positive relationship between the price level and the level of real GDP in the short run. Aggregate supply slopes up because when the price level for outputs increases, while the price level of inputs remains fixed, the opportunity for additional profits encourages more production. The aggregate supply curve is near-horizontal on the left and near-vertical on the right. In the long run, aggregate supply is shown by a vertical line at the level of potential output, which is the maximum level of output the economy can produce with its existing levels of workers, physical capital, technology, and economic institutions.\n\nThe downward-sloping aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the relationship between the price level for outputs and the quantity of total spending in the economy. It slopes down because of: (a) the wealth effect, which means that a higher price level leads to lower real wealth, which reduces the level of consumption; (b) the interest rate effect, which holds that a higher price level will mean a greater demand for money, which will tend to drive up interest rates and reduce investment spending; and (c) the foreign price effect, which holds that a rise in the price level will make domestic goods relatively more expensive, discouraging exports and encouraging imports.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch24mod02_sques}\n\n\n\nThe short run aggregate supply curve was constructed assuming that as the price of outputs increases, the price of inputs stays the same. How would an increase in the prices of important inputs, like energy, affect aggregate supply?\n\n\n\nHigher input prices make output less profitable, decreasing the desired supply. This is shown graphically as a leftward shift in the AS curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the AD/AS model, what prevents the economy from achieving equilibrium at potential output?\n\n\n\nEquilibrium occurs at the level of GDP where AD = AS. Insufficient aggregate demand could explain why the equilibrium occurs at a level of GDP less than potential. A decrease (or leftward shift) in aggregate supply could be another reason.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch24mod02_rques}\n\n\n\nWhat is on the horizontal axis of the AD/AS diagram? What is on the vertical axis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the economic reason why the SRAS curve slopes up?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the components of the aggregate demand (AD) curve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the economic reasons why the AD curve slopes down?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBriefly explain the reason for the near-horizontal shape of the SRAS curve on its far left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBriefly explain the reason for the near-vertical shape of the SRAS curve on its far right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is potential GDP?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#ch24mod02_ctques}\n\n\n\nOn a microeconomic demand curve, a decrease in price causes an increase in quantity demanded because the product in question is now relatively less expensive than substitute products. Explain why aggregate demand does not increase for the same reason in response to a decrease in the aggregate price level. In other words, what causes total spending to increase if it is not because goods are now cheaper?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems   {#ch24mod02_prob}\n\n\n\nReview the problem shown in the [Work It Out](#ch14mod02_workout01) titled \"Interpreting the AD/AS Model.\" Like the information provided in that feature, [[link]](#ch24mod02_tab02) shows information on aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the price level for the imaginary country of Xurbia.\n\n<table id=\"ch24mod02_tab02\" summary=\"This table has three column and eight rows.

When the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, then at every price level, a greater quantity of real GDP is produced. When the SRAS curve shifts to the left, then at every price level, a lower quantity of real GDP is produced. This module discusses two of the most important factors that can lead to shifts in the AS curve: productivity growth and input prices.\n\n### How Productivity Growth Shifts the AS Curve   {#ch24mod03_01}\n\nIn the long run, the most important factor shifting the AS curve is **productivity growth**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor. One measure of this is output per worker or **GDP per capita**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Over time, productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output. Historically, the real growth in GDP per capita in an advanced economy like the United States has averaged about 2% to 3% per year, but productivity growth has been faster during certain extended periods like the 1960s and the late 1990s through the early 2000s, or slower during periods like the 1970s. A higher level of productivity shifts the AS curve to the right, because with improved productivity, firms can produce a greater quantity of output at every price level. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_013) (a) shows an outward shift in productivity over two time periods. The AS curve shifts out from SRAS<sub>0</sub> to SRAS<sub>1</sub> to SRAS<sub>2</sub>, reflecting the rise in potential GDP in this economy, and the equilibrium shifts from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub>.\n\n The rise in productivity causes the SRAS curve to shift to the right. The original equilibrium E0 is at the intersection of AD and SRAS0. When SRAS shifts right, then the new equilibrium E1 is at the intersection of AD and SRAS1, and then yet another equilibrium, E2, is at the intersection of AD and SRAS2. Shifts in SRAS to the right, lead to a greater level of output and to downward pressure on the price level. (b) A higher price for inputs means that at any given price level for outputs, a lower quantity will be produced so aggregate supply will shift to the left from SRAS0 to AS1. The new equilibrium, E1, has a reduced quantity of output and a higher price level than the original equilibrium (E0).\"){: #CNX_Econ_C24_013 data-title=\"Shifts in Aggregate Supply\"}\n\nA shift in the SRAS curve to the right will result in a greater real GDP and downward pressure on the price level, if aggregate demand remains unchanged. However, if this shift in SRAS results from gains in productivity growth, which are typically measured in terms of a few percentage points per year, the effect will be relatively small over a few months or even a couple of years.\n\n### How Changes in Input Prices Shift the AS Curve   {#ch24mod_02}\n\nHigher prices for inputs that are widely used across the entire economy can have a macroeconomic impact on aggregate supply. Examples of such widely used inputs include wages and energy products. Increases in the price of such inputs will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the left, which means that at each given price level for outputs, a higher price for inputs will discourage production because it will reduce the possibilities for earning profits. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_013) (b) shows the aggregate supply curve shifting to the left, from SRAS<sub>0</sub> to SRAS<sub>1</sub>, causing the equilibrium to move from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>. The movement from the original equilibrium of E<sub>0</sub> to the new equilibrium of E<sub>1</sub> will bring a nasty set of effects: reduced GDP or recession, higher unemployment because the economy is now further away from potential GDP, and an inflationary higher price level as well. For example, the U.S. economy experienced recessions in 1974\u20131975, 1980\u20131982, 1990\u201391, 2001, and 2007\u20132009 that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices. In the 1970s, this pattern of a shift to the left in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed **stagflation**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nConversely, a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right, providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs. From 1985 to 1986, for example, the average price of crude oil fell by almost half, from $24 a barrel to $12 a barrel. Similarly, from 1997 to 1998, the price of a barrel of crude oil dropped from $17 per barrel to $11 per barrel. In both cases, the plummeting price of oil led to a situation like that presented earlier in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_013) (a), where the outward shift of SRAS to the right allowed the economy to expand, unemployment to fall, and inflation to decline.\n\nAlong with energy prices, two other key inputs that may shift the SRAS curve are the cost of labor, or wages, and the cost of imported goods that are used as inputs for other products. In these cases as well, the lesson is that lower prices for inputs cause SRAS to shift to the right, while higher prices cause it to shift back to the left.\n\n### Other Supply Shocks   {#ch24mod03_03}\n\nThe aggregate supply curve can also shift due to shocks to input goods or labor. For example, an unexpected early freeze could destroy a large number of agricultural crops, a shock that would shift the AS curve to the left since there would be fewer agricultural products available at any given price.\n\nSimilarly, shocks to the labor market can affect aggregate supply. An extreme example might be an overseas war that required a large number of workers to cease their ordinary production in order to go fight for their country. In this case, aggregate supply would shift to the left because there would be fewer workers available to produce goods at any given price.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch24mod03_summ}\n\nThe aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) diagram shows how AD and AS interact. The intersection of the AD and AS curves shows the equilibrium output and price level in the economy. Movements of either AS or AD will result in a different equilibrium output and price level. The aggregate supply curve will shift out to the right as productivity increases. It will shift back to the left as the price of key inputs rises, and will shift out to the right if the price of key inputs falls. If the AS curve shifts back to the left, the combination of lower output, higher unemployment, and higher inflation, called stagflation, occurs. If AS shifts out to the right, a combination of lower inflation, higher output, and lower unemployment is possible.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch24mod03_sques}\n\n\n\nSuppose the U.S. Congress passes significant immigration reform that makes it easier for foreigners to come to the United States to work. Use the AD/AS model to explain how this would affect the equilibrium level of GDP and the price level.\n\n\n\nImmigration reform as described should increase the labor supply, shifting SRAS to the right, leading to a higher equilibrium GDP and a lower price level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose concerns about the size of the federal budget deficit lead the U.S. Congress to cut all funding for research and development for ten years. Assuming this has an impact on technology growth, what does the AD/AS model predict would be the likely effect on equilibrium GDP and the price level?\n\n\n\nGiven the assumptions made here, the cuts in R&amp;D funding should reduce productivity growth. The model would show this as a leftward shift in the SRAS curve, leading to a lower equilibrium GDP and a higher price level.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch24mod03_rques}\n\n\n\nName some factors that could cause the SRAS curve to shift, and say whether they would shift SRAS to the right or to the left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill the shift of SRAS to the right tend to make the equilibrium quantity and price level higher or lower? What about a shift of SRAS to the left?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is stagflation?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#ch24mod03_ctques}\n\n\n\nEconomists expect that as the labor market continues to tighten going into the latter part of 2015 that workers should begin to expect wage increases in 2015 and 2016.

(Read the following Clear It Up feature for explanation of why imports are subtracted from exports and what this means for aggregate demand.) A shift of the AD curve to the right means that at least one of these components increased so that a greater amount of total spending would occur at every price level. A shift of the AD curve to the left means that at least one of these components decreased so that a lesser amount of total spending would occur at every price level. [The Keynesian Perspective](/m48749){: .target-chapter} will discuss the components of aggregate demand and the factors that affect them. Here, the discussion will sketch two broad categories that could cause AD curves to shift: changes in the behavior of consumers or firms and changes in government tax or spending policy.\n\n\n\nDo imports diminish aggregate demand?\n\nWe have seen that the formula for aggregate demand is AD = C + I + G + X - M, where M is the total value of imported goods. Why is there a minus sign in front of imports? Does this mean that more imports will result in a lower level of aggregate demand?\n\nWhen an American buys a foreign product, for example, it gets counted along with all the other consumption. So the income generated does not go to American producers, but rather to producers in another country; it would be wrong to count this as part of domestic demand. Therefore, imports added in consumption are subtracted back out in the M term of the equation.\n\nBecause of the way in which the demand equation is written, it is easy to make the mistake of thinking that imports are bad for the economy. Just keep in mind that every negative number in the M term has a corresponding positive number in the C or I or G term, and they always cancel out.\n\n\n\n### How Changes by Consumers and Firms Can Affect AD   {#ch24mod04_01}\n\nWhen consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy, they tend to consume more. If **business confidence**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is high, then firms tend to spend more on investment, believing that the future payoff from that investment will be substantial. Conversely, if consumer or business confidence drops, then consumption and investment spending decline.\n\nThe University of Michigan publishes a survey of **consumer confidence**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month. The survey results are then reported at [http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu][1], which break down the change in consumer confidence among different income levels. According to that index, consumer confidence averaged around 90 prior to the Great Recession, and then it fell to below 60 in late 2008, which was the lowest it had been since 1980. Since then, confidence has climbed from a 2011 low of 55.8 back to a level in the low 80s, which is considered close to being considered a healthy state.\n\nOne measure of business confidence is published by the OECD: the \\\"business tendency surveys\\\". Business opinion survey data are collected for 21 countries on future selling prices and employment, among other elements of the business climate. After sharply declining during the Great Recession, the measure has risen above zero again and is back to long-term averages (the indicator dips below zero when business outlook is weaker than usual). Of course, either of these survey measures is not very precise. They can however, suggest when confidence is rising or falling, as well as when it is relatively high or low compared to the past.\n\nBecause a rise in confidence is associated with higher consumption and investment demand, it will lead to an outward shift in the AD curve, and a move of the equilibrium, from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>, to a higher quantity of output and a higher price level, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_014) (a).\n\nConsumer and business confidence often reflect macroeconomic realities; for example, confidence is usually high when the economy is growing briskly and low during a recession. However, economic confidence can sometimes rise or fall for reasons that do not have a close connection to the immediate economy, like a risk of war, election results, foreign policy events, or a pessimistic prediction about the future by a prominent public figure. U.S. presidents, for example, must be careful in their public pronouncements about the economy. If they offer economic pessimism, they risk provoking a decline in confidence that reduces consumption and investment and shifts AD to the left, and in a self-fulfilling prophecy, contributes to causing the recession that the president warned against in the first place. A shift of AD to the left, and the corresponding movement of the equilibrium, from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>, to a lower quantity of output and a lower price level, is shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_014) (b).\n\n  An increase in consumer confidence or business confidence can shift AD to the right, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the right, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a higher quantity of output and also a higher price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example, the new equilibrium (E1) is also closer to potential GDP. An increase in government spending or a cut in taxes that leads to a rise in consumer spending can also shift AD to the right. (b) A decrease in consumer confidence or business confidence can shift AD to the left, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the left, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a lower quantity of output and also a lower price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example, the new equilibrium (E1) is also farther below potential GDP. A decrease in government spending or higher taxes that leads to a fall in consumer spending can also shift AD to the left.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C24_014 data-title=\"Shifts in Aggregate Demand\"}\n\n### How Government Macroeconomic Policy Choices Can Shift AD   {#ch24mod04_02}\n\nGovernment spending is one component of AD. Thus, higher government spending will cause AD to shift to the right, as in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_014) (a), while lower government spending will cause AD to shift to the left, as in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_014) (b). For example, in the United States, government spending declined by 3.2% of GDP during the 1990s, from 21% of GDP in 1991, and to 17.8% of GDP in 1998. However, from 2005 to 2009, the peak of the Great Recession, government spending increased from 19% of GDP to 21.4% of GDP. If changes of a few percentage points of GDP seem small to you, remember that since GDP was about $14.4 trillion in 2009, a seemingly small change of 2% of GDP is equal to close to $300 billion.\n\nTax policy can affect consumption and investment spending, too. Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand, while **tax**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} increases will tend to diminish it. Tax policy can also pump up investment demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment. Shifting C or I will shift the AD curve as a whole.\n\nDuring a **recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses, the U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts. During the recession of 2001, for example, a tax cut was enacted into law. At such times, the political rhetoric often focuses on how people going through hard times need relief from taxes. The aggregate supply and aggregate demand framework, however, offers a complementary rationale, as illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_008). The original equilibrium during a recession is at point E<sub>0</sub>, relatively far from the full employment level of output. The tax cut, by increasing consumption, shifts the AD curve to the right. At the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>), real GDP rises and unemployment falls and, because in this diagram the economy has not yet reached its potential or full employment level of GDP, any rise in the price level remains muted. Read the following Clear It Up feature to consider the question of whether economists favor tax cuts or oppose them.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C24_008 data-title=\"Recession and Full Employment in the AD/AS Model\"}\n\n\n\nDo economists favor tax cuts or oppose them?\n\nOne of the most fundamental divisions in American politics over the last few decades has been between those who believe that the government should cut taxes substantially and those who disagree. Ronald Reagan rode into the presidency in 1980 partly because of his promise, soon carried out, to enact a substantial tax cut. George Bush lost his bid for reelection against Bill Clinton in 1992 partly because he had broken his 1988 promise: \u201cRead my lips! No new taxes!\u201d In the 2000 presidential election, both George W. Bush and Al Gore advocated substantial tax cuts and Bush succeeded in pushing a package of tax cuts through Congress early in 2001. Disputes over tax cuts often ignite at the state and local level as well.\n\nWhat side are economists on? Do they support broad tax cuts or oppose them? The answer, unsatisfying to zealots on both sides, is that it depends. One issue is whether the tax cuts are accompanied by equally large government spending cuts. Economists differ, as does any broad cross-section of the public, on how large government spending should be and what programs might be cut back. A second issue, more relevant to the discussion in this chapter, concerns how close the economy is to the full employment level of output. In a recession, when the intersection of the AD and AS curves is far below the full employment level, tax cuts can make sense as a way of shifting AD to the right. However, when the economy is already doing extremely well, tax cuts may shift AD so far to the right as to generate inflationary pressures, with little gain to GDP.\n\nWith the AD/AS framework in mind, many economists might readily believe that the Reagan tax cuts of 1981, which took effect just after two serious recessions, were beneficial economic policy. Similarly, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and the Obama tax cuts of 2009 were enacted during recessions. However, some of the same economists who favor tax cuts in time of recession would be much more dubious about identical tax cuts at a time the economy is performing well and cyclical unemployment is low.\n\n\n\nThe use of government spending and tax cuts can be a useful tool to affect aggregate demand and it will be discussed in greater detail in the [Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy](/m48791){: .target-chapter} chapter and [The Impacts of Government Borrowing](/m48800){: .target-chapter}. Other policy tools can shift the aggregate demand curve as well. For example, as discussed in the [Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation](/m48768){: .target-chapter} chapter, the Federal Reserve can affect interest rates and the availability of credit. Higher interest rates tend to discourage borrowing and thus reduce both household spending on big-ticket items like houses and cars and investment spending by business. Conversely, lower interest rates will stimulate consumption and investment demand. Interest rates can also affect exchange rates, which in turn will have effects on the export and import components of aggregate demand.\n\nSpelling out the details of these alternative policies and how they affect the components of aggregate demand can wait for [The Keynesian Perspective](/m48749){: .target-chapter} chapter. Here, the key lesson is that a shift of the aggregate demand curve to the right leads to a greater real GDP and to upward pressure on the price level. Conversely, a shift of aggregate demand to the left leads to a lower real GDP and a lower price level. Whether these changes in output and price level are relatively large or relatively small, and how the change in equilibrium relates to potential GDP, depends on whether the shift in the AD curve is happening in the relatively flat or relatively steep portion of the AS curve.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch24mod04_summ}\n\nThe AD curve will shift out as the components of aggregate demand\u2014C, I, G, and X\u2013M\u2014rise. It will shift back to the left as these components fall. These factors can change because of different personal choices, like those resulting from consumer or business confidence, or from policy choices like changes in government spending and taxes. If the AD curve shifts to the right, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will rise. If the AD curve shifts to the left, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will fall. Whether equilibrium output changes relatively more than the price level or whether the price level changes relatively more than output is determined by where the AD curve intersects with the AS curve.\n\nThe AD/AS diagram superficially resembles the microeconomic supply and demand diagram on the surface, but in reality, what is on the horizontal and vertical axes and the underlying economic reasons for the shapes of the curves are very different. Long-term economic growth is illustrated in the AD/AS framework by a gradual shift of the aggregate supply curve to the right. A recession is illustrated when the intersection of AD and AS is substantially below potential GDP, while an expanding economy is illustrated when the intersection of AS and AD is near potential GDP.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch24mod04_sques}\n\n\n\nHow would a dramatic increase in the value of the stock market shift the AD curve? What effect would the shift have on the equilibrium level of GDP and the price level?\n\n\n\nAn increase in the value of the stock market would make individuals feel wealthier and thus more confident about their economic situation. This would likely cause an increase in consumer confidence leading to an increase in consumer spending, shifting the AD curve to the right. The result would be an increase in the equilibrium level of GDP and an increase in the price level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose Mexico, one of our largest trading partners and purchaser of a large quantity of our exports, goes into a recession. Use the AD/AS model to determine the likely impact on our equilibrium GDP and price level.\n\n\n\nSince imports depend on GDP, if Mexico goes into recession, its GDP declines and so do its imports. This decline in our exports can be shown as a leftward shift in AD, leading to a decrease in our GDP and price level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA policymaker claims that tax cuts led the economy out of a recession. Can we use the AD/AS diagram to show this?\n\n\n\nTax cuts increase consumer and investment spending, depending on where the tax cuts are targeted. This would shift AD to the right, so if the tax cuts occurred when the economy was in recession (and GDP was less than potential), the tax cuts would increase GDP and \u201clead the economy out of recession.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany financial analysts and economists eagerly await the press releases for the reports on the home price index and consumer confidence index. What would be the effects of a negative report on both of these? What about a positive report?\n\n\n\nA negative report on home prices would make consumers feel like the value of their homes, which for most Americans is a major portion of their wealth, has declined. A negative report on consumer confidence would make consumers feel pessimistic about the future. Both of these would likely reduce consumer spending, shifting AD to the left, reducing GDP and the price level. A positive report on the home price index or consumer confidence would do the opposite.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch24mod04_rques}\n\n\n\nName some factors that could cause AD to shift, and say whether they would shift AD to the right or to the left.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould a shift of AD to the right tend to make the equilibrium quantity and price level higher or lower?

Every model is a simplified version of the deeper reality and, in the context of the AD/AS model, the three macroeconomic goals arise in ways that are sometimes indirect or incomplete. In this module, we consider how the AD/AS model illustrates the three macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.\n\n### Growth and Recession in the AD/AS Diagram   {#ch24mod05_01}\n\nIn the AD/AS diagram, long-run economic growth due to productivity increases over time will be represented by a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply. The vertical line representing potential GDP (or the \u201cfull employment level of GDP\u201d) will gradually shift to the right over time as well. A pattern of economic growth over three years, with the AS curve shifting slightly out to the right each year, was shown earlier in [\\[link\\]](/m48742#CNX_Econ_C24_013) (a). However, the factors that determine the speed of this long-term economic growth rate\u2014like investment in physical and human capital, technology, and whether an economy can take advantage of catch-up growth\u2014do not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram.\n\nIn the short run, GDP falls and rises in every economy, as the economy dips into recession or expands out of recession. Recessions are illustrated in the AD/AS diagram when the equilibrium level of real GDP is substantially below potential GDP, as occurred at the equilibrium point E<sub>0</sub> in [\\[link\\]](/m48745#CNX_Econ_C24_008). On the other hand, in years of resurgent economic growth the equilibrium will typically be close to potential GDP, as shown at equilibrium point E<sub>1</sub> in that earlier figure.\n\n### Unemployment in the AD/AS Diagram   {#ch24mod05_02}\n\nTwo types of unemployment were described in the [Unemployment](/m48719){: .target-chapter} chapter. **Cyclical unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} bounces up and down according to the short-run movements of GDP. Over the long run, in the United States, the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5% (give or take one percentage point or so), when the economy is healthy. In many of the national economies across Europe, the rate of unemployment in recent decades has only dropped to about 10% or a bit lower, even in good economic years. This baseline level of unemployment that occurs year-in and year-out is called the **natural rate of unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and is determined by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market. Potential GDP can imply different unemployment rates in different economies, depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] for data on consumer confidence.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch24mod05_link01m\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nIn the AD/AS diagram, cyclical unemployment is shown by how close the economy is to the potential or full employment level of GDP. Returning to [\\[link\\]](/m48745#CNX_Econ_C24_008), relatively low cyclical unemployment for an economy occurs when the level of output is close to potential GDP, as in the equilibrium point E<sub>1</sub>. Conversely, high cyclical unemployment arises when the output is substantially to the left of potential GDP on the AD/AS diagram, as at the equilibrium point E<sub>0</sub>. The factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment are not shown separately in the AD/AS model, although they are implicitly part of what determines potential GDP or full employment GDP in a given economy.\n\n### Inflationary Pressures in the AD/AS Diagram   {#ch24mod05_03}\n\nInflation fluctuates in the short run. Higher inflation rates have typically occurred either during or just after economic booms: for example, the biggest spurts of inflation in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century followed the wartime booms of World War I and World War II. Conversely, rates of inflation generally decline during recessions. As an extreme example, inflation actually became negative\u2014a situation called \u201cdeflation\u201d\u2014during the Great Depression. Even during the relatively short recession of 1991\u20131992, the rate of inflation declined from 5.4% in 1990 to 3.0% in 1992. During the relatively short recession of 2001, the rate of inflation declined from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2002. During the deep recession of 2007\u20132009, the rate of inflation declined from 3.8% in 2008 to \u20130.4% in 2009. Some countries have experienced bouts of high inflation that lasted for years. In the U.S. economy since the mid\u20131980s, inflation does not seem to have had any long-term trend to be substantially higher or lower; instead, it has stayed in the range of 1\u20135% annually.\n\n\nVisit this [website][2] for data on business confidence.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch24mod05_link02m\" data-alt=\"QR Codes representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nThe AD/AS framework implies two ways that inflationary pressures may arise. One possible trigger is if aggregate demand continues to shift to the right when the economy is already at or near potential GDP and full employment, thus pushing the macroeconomic equilibrium into the steep portion of the AS curve. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_015) (a), there is a shift of aggregate demand to the right; the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> is clearly at a higher price level than the original equilibrium E<sub>0</sub>. In this situation, the aggregate demand in the economy has soared so high that firms in the economy are not capable of producing additional goods, because labor and physical capital are fully employed, and so additional increases in aggregate demand can only result in a rise in the price level.\n\n  A shift in aggregate demand, from AD0 to AD1, when it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the original equilibrium. (b) A shift in aggregate supply, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, will lead to a lower real GDP and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1), while the original equilibrium (E0) is at the lower price level (P0).\"){: #CNX_Econ_C24_015 data-title=\"Sources of Inflationary Pressure in the AD/AS Model\"}\n\nAn alternative source of inflationary pressures can occur due to a rise in input prices that affects many or most firms across the economy\u2014perhaps an important input to production like oil or labor\u2014and causes the aggregate supply curve to shift back to the left. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_015) (b), the shift of the SRAS curve to the left also increases the price level from P<sub>0</sub> at the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) to a higher price level of P<sub>1</sub> at the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>). In effect, the rise in input prices ends up, after the final output is produced and sold, being passed along in the form of a higher price level for outputs.\n\nThe AD/AS diagram shows only a one-time shift in the price level. It does not address the question of what would cause inflation either to vanish after a year, or to sustain itself for several years. There are two explanations for why inflation may persist over time. One way that continual inflationary price increases can occur is if the government continually attempts to stimulate aggregate demand in a way that keeps pushing the AD curve when it is already in the steep portion of the SRAS curve. A second possibility is that, if inflation has been occurring for several years, a certain level of inflation may come to be expected. For example, if consumers, workers, and businesses all expect prices and wages to rise by a certain amount, then these expected rises in the price level can become built into the annual increases of prices, wages, and interest rates of the economy. These two reasons are interrelated, because if a government fosters a macroeconomic environment with inflationary pressures, then people will grow to expect inflation. However, the AD/AS diagram does not show these patterns of ongoing or expected inflation in a direct way.\n\n### Importance of the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model   {#ch24mod05_04}\n\nMacroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which means that it needs to juggle many different concepts. For example, start with the three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. Aggregate demand has four elements: consumption, investment, government spending, and exports less imports. Aggregate supply reveals how businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher price level for outputs. Finally, a wide array of economic events and policy decisions can affect aggregate demand and aggregate supply, including government tax and spending decisions; consumer and business confidence; changes in prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings higher levels of productivity.\n\nThe aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is one of the fundamental diagrams in this course (like the budget constraint diagram introduced in the [Choice in a World of Scarcity](/m48602){: .target-chapter} chapter and the supply and demand diagram introduced in the [Demand and Supply](/m48628){: .target-chapter} chapter) because it provides an overall framework for bringing these factors together in one diagram. Indeed, some version of the AD/AS model will appear in every chapter in the rest of this book.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch24mod05_summ}\n\nCyclical unemployment is relatively large in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is substantially below potential GDP. Cyclical unemployment is small in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is near potential GDP. The natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the labor market institutions of the economy, is built into what is meant by potential GDP, but does not otherwise appear in an AD/AS diagram. Pressures for inflation to rise or fall are shown in the AD/AS framework when the movement from one equilibrium to another causes the price level to rise or to fall. The balance of trade does not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram, but it appears indirectly in several ways. Increases in exports or declines in imports can cause shifts in AD. Changes in the price of key imported inputs to production, like oil, can cause shifts in AS. The AD/AS model is the key model used in this book to understand macroeconomic issues.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch24mod05_sques}\n\n\n\nWhat impact would a decrease in the size of the labor force have on GDP and the price level according to the AD/AS model?\n\n\n\nA smaller labor force would be reflected in a leftward shift in AS, leading to a lower equilibrium level of GDP and higher price level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose, after five years of sluggish growth, the economy of the European Union picks up speed. What would be the likely impact on the U.S. trade balance, GDP, and employment?\n\n\n\nHigher EU growth would increase demand for U.S. exports, reducing our trade deficit. The increased demand for exports would show up as a rightward shift in AD, causing GDP to rise (and the price level to rise as well). Higher GDP would require more jobs to fulfill, so U.S. employment would also rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose the Federal Reserve begins to increase the supply of money at an increasing rate. What impact would that have on GDP, unemployment, and inflation?\n\n\n\nExpansionary monetary policy shifts AD to the right. A continuing expansionary policy would cause larger and larger shifts (given the parameters of this problem). The result would be an increase in GDP and employment (a decrease in unemployment) and higher prices until potential output was reached. After that point, the expansionary policy would simply cause inflation.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch24mod05_rques}\n\n\n\nHow is long-term growth illustrated in an AD/AS model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is recession illustrated in an AD/AS model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is cyclical unemployment illustrated in an AD/AS model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is the natural rate of unemployment illustrated in an AD/AS model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is pressure for inflationary price increases shown in an AD/AS model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the ways in which exports and imports can affect the AD/AS model?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#ch24mod05_ctques}\n\n\n\nSuppose the level of structural unemployment increases. How would the increase in structural unemployment be illustrated in the AD/AS model? *Hint*: How does structural unemployment affect potential GDP?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf foreign wealth-holders decide that the United States is the safest place to invest their savings, what would the effect be on the economy here? Show graphically using the AD/AS model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AD/AS model is static. It shows a snapshot of the economy at a given point in time. Both economic growth and inflation are dynamic phenomena. Suppose economic growth is 3% per year and aggregate demand is growing at the same rate. What does the AD/AS model say the inflation rate should be?\n\n\n\n\n### References   {#ch24mod05_ref}\n\nLibrary of Economics and Liberty. \u201cThe Concise Encyclopedia of Economics: Jean-Baptiste Say.\u201d http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Say.html.\n\nLibrary of Economics and Liberty. \u201cThe Concise Encyclopedia of Economics: John Maynard Keynes.\u201d http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Keynes.html.\n\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 2015. \\\"Business Tendency Surveys: Construction.\\\" Accessed March 4, 2015. http://stats.oecd.org/mei/default.asp?lang=e&amp;subject=6.\n\nUniversity of Michigan. 2015. \\\"Surveys of Consumers.\\\" Accessed March 4, 2015. http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/tables.html.\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/consumerconfid\n[2]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/businessconfid", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

Consider the three zones of the SRAS curve as identified in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_011)\\: the Keynesian zone, the neoclassical zone, and the intermediate zone.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C24_011 data-title=\"Keynes, Neoclassical, and Intermediate Zones in the Aggregate Supply Curve\"}\n\nFocus first on the **Keynesian zone**{: data-type=\"term\"}, that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ek, then certain statements about the economic situation will follow. In the Keynesian zone, the equilibrium level of real GDP is far below potential GDP, the economy is in recession, and cyclical unemployment is high. If aggregate demand shifted to the right or left in the Keynesian zone, it will determine the resulting level of output (and thus unemployment). However, inflationary price pressure is not much of a worry in the Keynesian zone, since the price level does not vary much in this zone.\n\nNow, focus your attention on the **neoclassical zone**{: data-type=\"term\"} of the SRAS curve, which is the near-vertical portion on the right-hand side. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or near potential GDP, then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in the economy. Since the equilibrium is near potential GDP, cyclical unemployment is low in this economy, although structural unemployment may remain an issue. In the neoclassical zone, shifts of aggregate demand to the right or the left have little effect on the level of output or employment. The only way to increase the size of the real GDP in the neoclassical zone is for AS to shift to the right. However, shifts in AD in the neoclassical zone will create pressures to change the price level.\n\nFinally, consider the **intermediate zone**{: data-type=\"term\"} of the SRAS curve in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C24_011). If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei, then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions. For instance, a shift of AD to the right will move output closer to potential GDP and thus reduce unemployment, but will also lead to a higher price level and upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, a shift of AD to the left will move output further from potential GDP and raise unemployment, but will also lead to a lower price level and downward pressure on inflation.\n\nThis approach of dividing the SRAS curve into different zones works as a diagnostic test that can be applied to an economy, like a doctor checking a patient for symptoms. First, figure out what zone the economy is in and then the economic issues, tradeoffs, and policy choices will be clarified. Some economists believe that the economy is strongly predisposed to be in one zone or another. Thus, hard-line Keynesian economists believe that the economies are in the Keynesian zone most of the time, and so they view the neoclassical zone as a theoretical abstraction. Conversely, hard-line neoclassical economists argue that economies are in the neoclassical zone most of the time and that the Keynesian zone is a distraction. [The Keynesian Perspective](/m48749){: .target-chapter} and [The Neoclassical Perspective](/m48756){: .target-chapter} should help to clarify the underpinnings and consequences of these contrasting views of the macroeconomy.\n\n\n\nFrom Housing Bubble to Housing Bust\n\nEconomic fluctuations, whether those experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the stagflation of the 1970s, or the Great Recession of 2008\u20132009, can be explained using the AD/AS diagram. Short-run fluctuations in output occur due to shifts of the SRAS curve, the AD curve, or both. In the case of the housing bubble, rising home values caused the AD curve to shift to the right as more people felt that rising home values increased their overall wealth. Many homeowners took on mortgages that exceeded their ability to pay because, as home values continued to go up, the increased value would pay off any debt outstanding. Increased wealth due to rising home values lead to increased home equity loans and increased spending. All these activities pushed AD to the right, contributing to low unemployment rates and economic growth in the United States. When the housing bubble burst, overall wealth dropped dramatically, wiping out the recent gains. This drop in the value of homes was a demand shock to the U.S. economy because of its impact directly on the wealth of the household sector, and its contagion into the financial that essentially locked up new credit. The AD curve shifted to the left as evidenced by the rising unemployment of the Great Recession.\n\nUnderstanding the source of these macroeconomic fluctuations provided monetary and fiscal policy makers with insight about what policy actions to take to mitigate the impact of the housing crisis. From a monetary policy perspective, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates to between 0% and 0.25 %, to loosen up credit throughout the financial system. Discretionary fiscal policy measures included the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that allowed for the purchase of troubled assets, such as mortgages, from financial institutions and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that increased government spending on infrastructure, provided for tax cuts, and increased transfer payments. In combination, both monetary and fiscal policy measures were designed to help stimulate aggregate demand in the U.S. economy, pushing the AD curve to the right.\n\nWhile most economists agree on the usefulness of the AD/AS diagram in analyzing the sources of these fluctuations, there is still some disagreement about the effectiveness of policy decisions that are useful in stabilizing these fluctuations. We discuss the possible policy actions and the differences among economists about their effectiveness in more detail in [The Keynesian Perspective](/m48749){: .target-chapter}, [Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation](/m48768){: .target-chapter}, and [Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy](/m48791){: .target-chapter}.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch24mod06_summ}\n\nThe SRAS curve can be divided into three zones. Keynes\u2019 law says demand creates its own supply, so that changes in aggregate demand cause changes in real GDP and employment. Keynes\u2019 law can be shown on the horizontal Keynesian zone of the aggregate supply curve. The Keynesian zone occurs at the left of the SRAS curve where it is fairly flat, so movements in AD will affect output, but have little effect on the price level. Say\u2019s law says supply creates its own demand. Changes in aggregate demand have no effect on real GDP and employment, only on the price level. Say\u2019s law can be shown on the vertical neoclassical zone of the aggregate supply curve. The neoclassical zone occurs at the right of the SRAS curve where it is fairly vertical, and so movements in AD will affect the price level, but have little impact on output. The intermediate zone in the middle of the SRAS curve is upward-sloping, so a rise in AD will cause higher output and price level, while a fall in AD will lead to a lower output and price level.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch24mod06_sques}\n\n\n\nIf the economy is operating in the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve and aggregate demand falls, what is likely to happen to real GDP?\n\n\n\nSince the SRAS curve is vertical in the neoclassical zone, unless the economy is bordering the intermediate zone, a decrease in AS will cause a decrease in the price level, but no effect on real economic activity (for example, real GDP or employment).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the economy is operating in the Keynesian zone of the SRAS curve and aggregate demand falls, what is likely to happen to real GDP?\n\n\n\nBecause the SRAS curve is horizontal in the Keynesian zone, a decrease in AD should depress real economic activity but have no effect on prices.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch24mod06_rques}\n\n\n\nWhat is the Keynesian zone of the SRAS curve? How much is the price level likely to change in the Keynesian zone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve? How much is the output level likely to change in the neoclassical zone?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the intermediate zone of the SRAS curve?

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of unemployed Americans rose from 6.8 million in May 2007 to 15.4 million in October 2009. During that time, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 170,000 small businesses closed. Mass layoffs peaked in February 2009 when 326,392 workers were given notice. U.S. productivity and output fell as well. Job losses, declining home values, declining incomes, and uncertainty about the future caused consumption expenditures to decrease. According to the BLS, household spending dropped by 7.8%.\n\nHome foreclosures and the meltdown in U.S. financial markets called for immediate action by Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve Bank. For example, programs such as the American Restoration and Recovery Act were implemented to help millions of people by providing tax credits for homebuyers, paying \u201ccash for clunkers,\u201d and extending unemployment benefits. From cutting back on spending, filing for unemployment, and losing homes, millions of people were affected by the recession. And while the United States is now on the path to recovery, the impact will be felt for many years to come.\n\nWhat caused this recession and what prevented the economy from spiraling further into another depression? Policymakers looked to the lessons learned from the Great Depression of the 1930s and to the models developed by John Maynard Keynes to analyze the causes and find solutions to the country\u2019s economic woes. The Keynesian perspective is the subject of this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to the Keynesian Perspective\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Aggregate Demand in Keynesian Analysis\n* The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis\n* The Phillips Curve\n* The Keynesian Perspective on Market Forces\n\n\n\nWe have learned that the level of economic activity, for example output, employment, and spending, tends to grow over time. In [The Keynesian Perspective](/m48749){: .target-chapter} we learned the reasons for this trend. [The Macroeconomic Perspective](/m48705){: .target-chapter} pointed out that the economy tends to cycle around the long-run trend. In other words, the economy does not always grow at its average growth rate. Sometimes economic activity grows at the trend rate, sometimes it grows more than the trend, sometimes it grows less than the trend, and sometimes it actually declines. You can see this cyclical behavior in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_027).\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C25_027 data-title=\"U.S. Gross Domestic Product, Percent Changes 1930&#x2013;2014\"}\n\nThis empirical reality raises two important questions: How can we explain the cycles, and to what extent can they be moderated? This chapter (on the Keynesian perspective) and [The Neoclassical Perspective](/m48756){: .target-chapter} explore those questions from two different points of view, building on what we learned in [The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model](/m48739){: .target-chapter}.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48750", "module_title": "Economics - m48750", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48750", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Explain real GDP, recessionary gaps, and inflationary gaps\n* Recognize the Keynesian AD/AS model\n* Identify the determining factors of both consumption expenditure and investment expenditure\n* Analyze the factors that determine government spending and net exports\n\n\n\nThe Keynesian perspective focuses on aggregate demand. The idea is simple: firms produce output only if they expect it to sell. Thus, while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation\u2019s **potential GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the amount of goods and services actually being sold, known as **real GDP**{: data-type=\"term\"}, depends on how much demand exists across the economy. This point is illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_031).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C25_031 data-title=\"The Keynesian AD/AS Model\"}\n\nKeynes argued that, for reasons we explain shortly, aggregate demand is not stable\u2014that it can change unexpectedly. Suppose the economy starts where AD intersects SRAS at P<sub>0</sub> and Yp. Because Yp is potential output, the economy is at full employment. Because AD is volatile, it can easily fall. Thus, even if we start at Yp, if AD falls, then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a **recessionary gap**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment, as shown at Y<sub>1</sub> in the [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_031). Keynes believed that the economy would tend to stay in a recessionary gap, with its attendant unemployment, for a significant period of time.\n\nIn the same way (though not shown in the figure), if AD increases, the economy could experience an **inflationary gap**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output. As a consequence, the economy experiences inflation. The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap, increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output.\n\nRecall from [The Aggregate Supply-Aggregate Demand Model](/m48739){: .target-chapter} that **aggregate demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is total spending, economy-wide, on domestic goods and services. (Aggregate demand (AD) is actually what economists call total planned expenditure. Read the appendix on [The Expenditure-Output Model](/m48835) for more on this.) You may also remember that aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption expenditure, investment expenditure, government spending, and spending on net exports (exports minus imports). In the following sections, we will examine each component through the Keynesian perspective.\n\n### What Determines Consumption Expenditure?   {#ch25mod02_01}\n\nConsumption expenditure is spending by households and individuals on durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. Durable goods are things that last and provide value over time, such as automobiles. Nondurable goods are things like groceries\u2014once you consume them, they are gone. Recall from [The Macroeconomic Perspective](/m48705) that **services**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} are intangible things consumers buy, like healthcare or entertainment.\n\nKeynes identified three factors that affect consumption:\n\n* Disposable income: For most people, the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is how much income they have in their take-home pay, also known as **disposable income**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is income after taxes.\n* Expected future income: Consumer expectations about future income also are important in determining consumption. If consumers feel optimistic about the future, they are more likely to spend and increase overall aggregate demand. News of recession and troubles in the economy will make them pull back on consumption.\n* Wealth or credit: When households experience a rise in wealth, they may be willing to consume a higher share of their income and to save less. When the U.S. stock market rose dramatically in the late 1990s, for example, U.S. rates of saving declined, probably in part because people felt that their wealth had increased and there was less need to save. How do people spend beyond their income, when they perceive their wealth increasing? The answer is borrowing. On the other side, when the U.S. stock market declined about 40% from March 2008 to March 2009, people felt far greater uncertainty about their economic future, so rates of saving increased while consumption declined.\n{: data-bullet-style=\"bullet\"}\n\nFinally, Keynes noted that a variety of other factors combine to determine how much people save and spend. If household preferences about saving shift in a way that encourages consumption rather than saving, then AD will shift out to the right.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] for more information about how the recession affected various groups of people.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch25mod02_link01m\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### What Determines Investment Expenditure?   {#ch25mod02_02}\n\nSpending on new capital goods is called **investment expenditure**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Investment falls into four categories: producer\u2019s durable equipment and software, new nonresidential structures (such as factories, offices, and retail locations), changes in inventories, and residential structures (such as single-family homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings). The first three types of investment are conducted by businesses, while the last is conducted by households.\n\nKeynes\u2019s treatment of investment focuses on the key role of expectations about the future in influencing business decisions. When a business decides to make an investment in physical assets, like plants or equipment, or in intangible assets, like skills or a research and development project, that firm considers both the expected benefits of the investment (expectations of future profits) and the costs of the investment (interest rates).\n\n* Expectations of future profits: The clearest driver of the benefits of an investment is expectations for future profits. When an economy is expected to grow, businesses perceive a growing market for their products. Their higher degree of business confidence will encourage new investment. For example, in the second half of the 1990s, U.S. investment levels surged from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 21% in 2000. However, when a recession started in 2001, U.S. investment levels quickly sank back to 18% of GDP by 2002.\n* Interest rates also play a significant role in determining how much investment a firm will make. Just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes, so businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items. The cost of investment thus includes the **interest rate**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Even if the firm has the funds, the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital. Lower interest rates stimulate investment spending and higher interest rates reduce it.\n{: data-bullet-style=\"bullet\"}\n\nMany factors can affect the expected profitability on investment. For example, if the price of energy declines, then investments that use energy as an input will yield higher profits. If government offers special incentives for investment (for example, through the tax code), then investment will look more attractive; conversely, if government removes special investment incentives from the tax code, or increases other business taxes, then investment will look less attractive. As Keynes noted, business investment is the most variable of all the components of aggregate demand.\n\n### What Determines Government Spending?   {#ch25mod02_03}\n\nThe third component of aggregate demand is spending by federal, state, and local governments. Although the United States is usually thought of as a market economy, government still plays a significant role in the economy. As we discuss in [Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities](/m48668){: .target-chapter} and [Positive Externalitites and Public Goods](/m48675){: .target-chapter}, government provides important public services such as national defense, transportation infrastructure, and education.\n\nKeynes recognized that the government budget offered a powerful tool for influencing aggregate demand. Not only could AD be stimulated by more government spending (or reduced by less government spending), but consumption and investment spending could be influenced by lowering or raising tax rates. Indeed, Keynes concluded that during extreme times like deep recessions, only the government had the power and resources to move aggregate demand.\n\n### What Determines Net Exports?   {#ch25mod02_04}\n\nRecall that **exports**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} are products produced domestically and sold abroad while **imports**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} are products produced abroad but purchased domestically. Since aggregate demand is defined as spending on domestic goods and services, export expenditures add to AD, while import expenditures subtract from AD.\n\nTwo sets of factors can cause shifts in export and import demand: changes in relative growth rates between countries and changes in relative prices between countries. The level of demand for a nation\u2019s exports tends to be most heavily affected by what is happening in the economies of the countries that would be purchasing those exports. For example, if major importers of American-made products like Canada, Japan, and Germany have recessions, exports of U.S. products to those countries are likely to decline. Conversely, the quantity of a nation\u2019s imports is directly affected by the amount of income in the domestic economy: more income will bring a higher level of imports.\n\nExports and imports can also be affected by relative prices of goods in domestic and international markets. If U.S. goods are relatively cheaper compared with goods made in other places, perhaps because a group of U.S. producers has mastered certain productivity breakthroughs, then U.S. exports are likely to rise. If U.S. goods become relatively more expensive, perhaps because a change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies has pushed up the price of inputs to production in the United States, then exports from U.S. producers are likely to decline.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#ch25mod02_tbl01) summarizes the reasons given here for changes in aggregate demand.\n\n<table id=\"ch25mod02_tbl01\" summary=\"The table shows summaries of common reasons for changes in aggregate demand.

Consumption will change for a number of reasons, including movements in income, taxes, expectations about future income, and changes in wealth levels. Investment will change in response to its expected profitability, which in turn is shaped by expectations about future economic growth, the creation of new technologies, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment. Investment will also change when interest rates rise or fall. Government spending and taxes are determined by political considerations. Exports and imports change according to relative growth rates and prices between two economies.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch25mod02_sques}\n\n\n\nIn the Keynesian framework, which of the following events might cause a recession?

Which offer a possible solution to inflation?\n\n1.  A tax increase on consumer income.\n2.  A surge in military spending.\n3.  A reduction in taxes for businesses that increase investment.\n4.  A major increase in what the U.S. government spends on healthcare.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  A tax increase on consumer income will cause consumption to fall, pushing the AD curve left, and is a possible solution to inflation.\n2.  A surge in military spending is an increase in government spending. This will cause the AD curve to shift to the right. If real GDP is less than potential GDP, then this spending would pull the economy out of a recession. If real GDP is to the right of potential GDP, then the AD curve will shift farther to the right and military spending will be inflationary.\n3.  A tax cut focused on business investment will shift AD to the right. If the original macroeconomic equilibrium is below potential GDP, then this policy can help move an economy out of a recession.\n4.  Government spending on healthcare will cause the AD curve to shift to the right. If real GDP is less than potential GDP, then this spending would pull the economy out of a recession. If real GDP is to th right of potential GDP, then the AD curve will shift farther to the right and healthcare spending will be inflationary.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch25mod02_rques}\n\n\n\nName some economic events not related to government policy that could cause aggregate demand to shift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName some government policies that could cause aggregate demand to shift.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#ch25mod02_ctques}\n\n\n\nIn its recent report, The Conference Board\u2019s *Global Economic Outlook 2015*, updated November 2014 (http://www.conference-board.org/data/globaloutlook.cfm), projects China\u2019s growth between 2015 and 2019 to be about 5.5%. *International Business Times* (http://www.ibtimes.com/us-exports-china-have-grown-294-over-past-decade-1338693) reports that China is the United States\u2019 third largest export market, with exports to China growing 294% over the last ten years.

{"module_id": "m48751", "module_title": "Economics - m48751", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48751", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Evaluate the Keynesian view of recessions through an understanding of sticky wages and prices and the importance of aggregate demand\n* Explain the coordination argument, menu costs, and macroeconomic externality\n* Analyze the impact of the expenditure multiplier\n\n\n\nNow that we have a clear understanding of what constitutes aggregate demand, we return to the Keynesian argument using the model of aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS). (For a similar treatment using Keynes\u2019 income-expenditure model, see the appendix on [The Expenditure-Output Model](/m48835).)\n\nKeynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy prescription for minimizing their effects. The Keynesian view of **recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is based on two key building blocks. First, aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment. Second, the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of **sticky wages and prices**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand. We will consider these two claims in turn, and then see how they are represented in the AD/AS model.\n\nThe first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of household and business sector demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed. In other words, the intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of output less than the level of GDP consistent with full employment. Suppose the stock market crashes, as occurred in 1929. Or, suppose the housing market collapses, as occurred in 2008. In either case, household wealth will decline, and consumption expenditure will follow. Suppose businesses see that consumer spending is falling. That will reduce expectations of the profitability of investment, so businesses will decrease investment expenditure.\n\nThis seemed to be the case during the Great Depression, since the physical capacity of the economy to supply goods did not alter much. No flood or earthquake or other natural disaster ruined factories in 1929 or 1930. No outbreak of disease decimated the ranks of workers. No key input price, like the price of oil, soared on world markets. The U.S. economy in 1933 had just about the same factories, workers, and state of technology as it had had four years earlier in 1929\u2014and yet the economy had shrunk dramatically. This also seems to be what happened in 2008.\n\nAs Keynes recognized, the events of the Depression contradicted Say\u2019s law that \u201csupply creates its own demand.\u201d Although production capacity existed, the markets were not able to sell their products. As a result, real GDP was less than potential GDP.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] for raw data used to calculate GDP.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch25mod03_link01m\" data-alt=\"QR Codes representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Wage and Price Stickiness   {#ch25mod03_01}\n\nKeynes also pointed out that although AD fluctuated, prices and wages did not immediately respond as economists often expected. Instead, prices and wages are \u201csticky,\u201d making it difficult to restore the economy to full employment and potential GDP. Keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky: the **coordination argument**{: data-type=\"term\"}. This argument points out that, even if most people would be willing\u2014at least hypothetically\u2014to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline, a market-oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of coordinated wage reductions. [Unemployment](/m48719){: .target-chapter} proposed a number of reasons why wages might be sticky downward, most of which center on the argument that businesses avoid wage cuts because they may in one way or another depress morale and hurt the productivity of the existing workers.\n\nSome modern economists have argued in a Keynesian spirit that, along with wages, other prices may be sticky, too. Many firms do not change their prices every day or even every month. When a firm considers changing prices, it must consider two sets of costs. First, changing prices uses company resources: managers must analyze the competition and market demand and decide what the new prices will be, sales materials must be updated, billing records will change, and product labels and price labels must be redone. Second, frequent price changes may leave customers confused or angry\u2014especially if they find out that a product now costs more than expected. These costs of changing prices are called **menu costs**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014like the costs of printing up a new set of menus with different prices in a restaurant. Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand, but from a macroeconomic perspective, the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time.\n\nTo understand the effect of sticky wages and prices in the economy, consider [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_024) (a) illustrating the overall labor market, while [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_024) (b) illustrates a market for a specific good or service. The original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) in each market occurs at the intersection of the demand curve (D<sub>0</sub>) and supply curve (S<sub>0</sub>). When aggregate demand declines, the demand for labor shifts to the left (to D<sub>1</sub>) in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_024) (a) and the demand for goods shifts to the left (to D<sub>1</sub>) in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_024) (b). However, because of sticky wages and prices, the wage remains at its original level (W<sub>0</sub>) for a period of time and the price remains at its original level (P<sub>0</sub>).\n\nAs a result, a situation of excess supply\u2014where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the existing wage or price\u2014exists in markets for both labor and goods, and Q<sub>1</sub> is less than Q<sub>0</sub> in both [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_024) (a) and [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_024) (b). When many labor markets and many goods markets all across the economy find themselves in this position, the economy is in a recession; that is, firms cannot sell what they wish to produce at the existing market price and do not wish to hire all who are willing to work at the existing market wage. The Clear It Up feature discusses this problem in more detail.\n\n and (b), demand shifts left from D0 to D1. However, the wage in (a) and the price in (b) do not immediately decline. In (a), the quantity demanded of labor at the original wage (W0) is Q0, but with the new demand curve for labor (D1), it will be Q1. Similarly, in (b), the quantity demanded of goods at the original price (P0) is Q0, but at the new demand curve (D1) it will be Q1. An excess supply of labor will exist, which is called unemployment. An excess supply of goods will also exist, where the quantity demanded is substantially less than the quantity supplied. Thus, sticky wages and sticky prices, combined with a drop in demand, bring about unemployment and recession.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C25_024 data-title=\"Sticky Prices and Falling Demand in the Labor and Goods Market\"}\n\n\n\nWhy Is the Pace of Wage Adjustments Slow?\n\nThe recovery after the Great Recession in the United States has been slow, with wages stagnant, if not declining. In fact, many low-wage workers at McDonalds, Dominos, and Walmart have threatened to strike for higher wages. Their plight is part of a larger trend in job growth and pay in the post\u2013recession recovery.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C25_028 data-title=\"Jobs Lost/Gained in the Recession/Recovery\"}\n\n\nThe National Employment Law Project compiled data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that, during the Great Recession, 60% of job losses were in medium-wage occupations. Most of them were replaced during the recovery period with lower-wage jobs in the service, retail, and food industries. This data is illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_028).\n\nWages in the service, retail, and food industries are at or near minimum wage and tend to be both downwardly and upwardly \u201csticky.\u201d Wages are downwardly sticky due to minimum wage laws; they may be upwardly sticky if insufficient competition in low-skilled labor markets enables employers to avoid raising wages that would reduce their profits. At the same time, however, the Consumer Price Index increased 11% between 2007 and 2012, pushing real wages down.\n\n\n\n### The Two Keynesian Assumptions in the AD/AS Model   {#ch25mod02_02}\n\nThese two Keynesian assumptions\u2014the importance of aggregate demand in causing recession and the stickiness of wages and prices\u2014are illustrated by the AD/AS diagram in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_035). Note that because of the stickiness of wages and prices, the aggregate supply curve is flatter than either supply curve (labor or specific good). In fact, if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all, the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_035). This outcome is an important example of a **macroeconomic externality**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level. For example, a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales. But if all firms experience a decrease in demand for their products, sticky prices in the aggregate prevent aggregate demand from rebounding (which would be shown as a movement along the AD curve in response to a lower price level).\n\nThe original equilibrium of this economy occurs where the aggregate demand function (AD<sub>0</sub>) intersects with AS. Since this intersection occurs at potential GDP (Yp), the economy is operating at full employment. When aggregate demand shifts to the left, all the adjustment occurs through decreased real GDP. There is no decrease in the price level. Since the equilibrium occurs at Y<sub>1</sub>, the economy experiences substantial unemployment.\n\n  illustrates the two key assumptions behind Keynesian economics. The importance of aggregate demand is shown because this equilibrium is a recession which has occurred because aggregate demand is at AD1 instead of AD0. The importance of sticky wages and prices is shown because of the assumption of fixed wages and prices, which make the SRAS curve flat below potential GDP. Thus, when AD falls, the intersection E1 occurs in the flat portion of the SRAS curve where the price level does not change.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C25_035 data-title=\"A Keynesian Perspective of Recession\"}\n\n### The Expenditure Multiplier   {#ch25mod02_03}\n\nA key concept in Keynesian economics is the **expenditure multiplier**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The expenditure multiplier is the idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP, but that spending is powerful. More precisely, it means that a change in spending causes a more than proportionate change in GDP.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mtext>\u0394Y</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mtext>\u0394Spending</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>&gt;</mo><mn>1</mn> </mrow> </math>\n\n\nThe reason for the expenditure multiplier is that one person\u2019s spending becomes another person\u2019s income, which leads to additional spending and additional income, and so forth, so that the cumulative impact on GDP is larger than the initial increase in spending. The details of the multiplier process are provided in the appendix on [The Expenditure-Output Model](/m48835), but the concept is important enough to be summarized here. While the multiplier is important for understanding the effectiveness of fiscal policy, it occurs whenever any autonomous increase in spending occurs. Additionally, the multiplier operates in a negative as well as a positive direction. Thus, when investment spending collapsed during the Great Depression, it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP. The size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in recent discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama administration\u2019s fiscal stimulus package, officially titled the **American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch25mod02_summ}\n\nKeynesian economics is based on two main ideas: (1) aggregate demand is more likely than aggregate supply to be the primary cause of a short-run economic event like a recession; (2) wages and prices can be sticky, and so, in an economic downturn, unemployment can result. The latter is an example of a macroeconomic externality. While surpluses cause prices to fall at the micro level, they do not necessarily at the macro level; instead the adjustment to a decrease in demand occurs only through decreased quantities. One reason why prices may be sticky is menu costs, the costs of changing prices. These include internal costs a business faces in changing prices in terms of labeling, recordkeeping, and accounting, and also the costs of communicating the price change to (possibly unhappy) customers. Keynesians also believe in the existence of the expenditure multiplier\u2014the notion that a change in autonomous expenditure causes a more than proportionate change in GDP.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch25mod02_sques}\n\n\n\nUse the AD/AS model to explain how an inflationary gap occurs, beginning from the initial equilibrium in [[link]](#CNX_Econ_C25_035).\n\n\n\nAn inflationary gap is the result of an increase in aggregate demand when the economy is at potential output.

Phillips**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, an economist at the London School of Economics, was studying the Keynesian analytical framework. The Keynesian theory implied that during a recession inflationary pressures are low, but when the level of output is at or even pushing beyond potential GDP, the economy is at greater risk for inflation. Phillips analyzed 60 years of British data and did find that tradeoff between unemployment and inflation, which became known as a **Phillips curve**{: data-type=\"term\"}. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_006) shows a theoretical Phillips curve, and the following Work It Out feature shows how the pattern appears for the United States.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C25_006 data-title=\"A Keynesian Phillips Curve Tradeoff between Unemployment and Inflation\"}\n\n\n\nThe Phillips Curve for the United States\n\nStep 1.

What does the graph look like? Do you still see the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment? Your graph should look like [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_033).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C25_033 data-title=\"U.S. Phillips Curve, 1960&#x2013;1979\"}\n\n\nOver this longer period of time, the Phillips curve appears to have shifted out. There is no tradeoff any more.\n\n\n\n### The Instability of the Phillips Curve   {#ch25mod02_02}\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Phillips curve was seen as a policy menu. A nation could choose low inflation and high unemployment, or high inflation and low unemployment, or anywhere in between. Fiscal and monetary policy could be used to move up or down the Phillips curve as desired. Then a curious thing happened. When policymakers tried to exploit the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, the result was an increase in both inflation and unemployment. What had happened? The Phillips curve shifted.\n\nThe U.S. economy experienced this pattern in the deep recession from 1973 to 1975, and again in back-to-back recessions from 1980 to 1982. Many nations around the world saw similar increases in unemployment and inflation. This pattern became known as **stagflation**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. (Recall from [The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model](/m48739){: .target-chapter} that stagflation is an unhealthy combination of high unemployment and high inflation.) Perhaps most important, stagflation was a phenomenon that could not be explained by traditional Keynesian economics.\n\nEconomists have concluded that two factors cause the Phillips curve to shift. The first is supply shocks, like the Oil Crisis of the mid-1970s, which first brought stagflation into our vocabulary. The second is changes in people\u2019s expectations about inflation. In other words, there may be a tradeoff between **inflation**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} when people expect no inflation, but when they realize inflation is occurring, the tradeoff disappears. Both factors (supply shocks and changes in inflationary expectations) cause the aggregate supply curve, and thus the Phillips curve, to shift.\n\nIn short, a downward-sloping Phillips curve should be interpreted as valid for short-run periods of several years, but over longer periods, when aggregate supply shifts, the downward-sloping Phillips curve can shift so that unemployment and inflation are both higher (as in the 1970s and early 1980s) or both lower (as in the early 1990s or first decade of the 2000s).\n\n### Keynesian Policy for Fighting Unemployment and Inflation   {#ch25mod02_03}\n\nKeynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is **expansionary fiscal policy**{: data-type=\"term\"}, such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. For example, if aggregate demand was originally at ADr in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_010), so that the economy was in recession, the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the right from ADr to ADf, where the economy would be at potential GDP and full employment.\n\nKeynes noted that while it would be nice if the government could spend additional money on housing, roads, and other amenities, he also argued that if the government could not agree on how to spend money in practical ways, then it could spend in impractical ways. For example, Keynes suggested building monuments, like a modern equivalent of the Egyptian pyramids. He proposed that the government could bury money underground, and let mining companies get started to dig the money up again. These suggestions were slightly tongue-in-cheek, but their purpose was to emphasize that a Great Depression is no time to quibble over the specifics of government spending programs and tax cuts when the goal should be to pump up aggregate demand by enough to lift the economy to **potential GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C25_010 data-title=\"Fighting Recession and Inflation with Keynesian Policy\"}\n\nThe other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is operating above potential GDP. In this situation, unemployment is low, but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern. The Keynesian response would be **contractionary fiscal policy**{: data-type=\"term\"}, using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left. The result would be downward pressure on the price level, but very little reduction in output or very little rise in unemployment. If aggregate demand was originally at ADi in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_010), so that the economy was experiencing inflationary rises in the price level, the appropriate policy would be for government to shift aggregate demand to the left, from ADi toward ADf, which reduces the pressure for a higher price level while the economy remains at full employment.\n\nIn the Keynesian economic model, too little aggregate demand brings unemployment and too much brings inflation. Thus, you can think of Keynesian economics as pursuing a \u201cGoldilocks\u201d level of aggregate demand: not too much, not too little, but looking for what is just right.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch25mod03_summ}\n\nA Phillips curve shows the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation in an economy. From a Keynesian viewpoint, the Phillips curve should slope down so that higher unemployment means lower inflation, and vice versa. However, a downward-sloping Phillips curve is a short-term relationship that may shift after a few years.\n\nKeynesian macroeconomics argues that the solution to a recession is expansionary fiscal policy, such as tax cuts to stimulate consumption and investment, or direct increases in government spending that would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right. The other side of Keynesian policy occurs when the economy is operating above potential GDP. In this situation, unemployment is low, but inflationary rises in the price level are a concern. The Keynesian response would be contractionary fiscal policy, using tax increases or government spending cuts to shift AD to the left.\n\n### Self-Check Question   {#ch25mod03_sques}\n\n\n\nHow would a decrease in energy prices affect the Phillips curve?\n\n\n\nA decrease in energy prices, a positive supply shock, would cause the AS curve to shift out to the right, yielding more real GDP at a lower price level. This would shift the Phillips curve down toward the origin, meaning the economy would experience lower unemployment and a lower rate of inflation.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch25mod03_rques}\n\n\n\nWhat tradeoff is shown by a Phillips curve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould you expect to see long-run data trace out a stable downward-sloping Phillips curve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Keynesian prescription for recession?

In the aftermath of the human devastation and misery of the Great Depression, many people\u2014including many economists\u2014became more aware of vulnerabilities within the market-oriented economic system. Some supporters of Keynesian economics advocated a high degree of government planning in all parts of the economy.\n\nHowever, Keynes himself was careful to separate the issue of aggregate demand from the issue of how well individual markets worked. He argued that individual markets for goods and services were appropriate and useful, but that sometimes that level of aggregate demand was just too low. When 10 million people are willing and able to work, but one million of them are unemployed, he argued, individual markets may be doing a perfectly good job of allocating the efforts of the nine million workers\u2014the problem is that insufficient aggregate demand exists to support jobs for all 10 million. Thus, he believed that, while government should ensure that overall level of aggregate demand is sufficient for an economy to reach full employment, this task did not imply that the government should attempt to set prices and wages throughout the economy, nor to take over and manage large corporations or entire industries directly.\n\nEven if one accepts the Keynesian economic theory, a number of practical questions remain. In the real world, can government economists identify potential GDP accurately? Is a desired increase in aggregate demand better accomplished by a tax cut or by an increase in government spending? Given the inevitable delays and uncertainties as policies are enacted into law, is it reasonable to expect that the government can implement Keynesian economics? Can fixing a recession really be just as simple as pumping up aggregate demand? [Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy](/m48791){: .target-chapter} will probe these issues. The Keynesian approach, with its focus on aggregate demand and sticky prices, has proved useful in understanding how the economy fluctuates in the short run and why recessions and cyclical unemployment occur. In [The Neoclassical Perspective](/m48756){: .target-chapter}, we will consider some of the shortcomings of the Keynesian approach and why it is not especially well-suited for long-run macroeconomic analysis.\n\n\n\nThe Great Recession\n\nThe lessons learned during the Great Depression of the 1930s and the aggregate expenditure model proposed by John Maynard Keynes gave the modern economists and policymakers of today the tools to effectively navigate the treacherous economy in the latter half of the 2000s. In \u201cHow the Great Recession Was Brought to an End,\u201d Alan S. Blinder and Mark Zandi wrote that the actions taken by today\u2019s policymakers stand in sharp contrast to those of the early years of the Great Depression. Today\u2019s economists and policymakers were not content to let the markets recover from recession without taking proactive measures to support consumption and investment. The Federal Reserve actively lowered short-term interest rates and developed innovative ways to pump money into the economy so that credit and investment would not dry up. Both Presidents Bush and Obama and Congress implemented a variety of programs ranging from tax rebates to \u201cCash for Clunkers\u201d to the Troubled Asset Relief Program to stimulate and stabilize household consumption and encourage investment. Although these policies came under harsh criticism from the public and many politicians, they lessened the impact of the economic downturn and may have saved the country from a second Great Depression.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch25mod03_summ}\n\nThe Keynesian prescription for stabilizing the economy implies government intervention at the macroeconomic level\u2014increasing aggregate demand when private demand falls and decreasing aggregate demand when private demand rises. This does not imply that the government should be passing laws or regulations that set prices and quantities in microeconomic markets.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch25mod03_sques}\n\n\n\nDoes Keynesian economics require government to set controls on prices, wages, or interest rates?\n\n\n\nKeynesian economics does not require microeconomic price controls of any sort. It is true that many Keynesian economic prescriptions were for the government to influence the total amount of aggregate demand in the economy, often through government spending and tax cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList three practical problems with the Keynesian perspective.\n\n\n\nThe three problems center on government\u2019s ability to estimate potential GDP, decide whether to influence aggregate demand through tax changes or changes in government spending, and the lag time that occurs as Congress and the President attempt to pass legislation.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch25mod03_rques}\n\n\n\nHow did the Keynesian perspective address the economic market failure of the Great Depression?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#ch25mod03_ctques}\n\n\n\nReturn to the table from the *Economic Report of the President* in the earlier [Work It Out](/m48753#ch25mod03_workout01) feature titled \u201cThe Phillips Curve for the United States.\u201d How would you expect government spending to have changed over the last six years?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain what types of policies the federal government may have implemented to restore aggregate demand and the potential obstacles policymakers may have encountered.\n\n\n\n\n### References   {#ch25mod03_ref}\n\nBlinder, Alan S., and Mark Zandi. \u201cHow the Great Recession Was Brought to an End.\u201d Last modified July 27, 2010. http://www.princeton.edu/~blinder/End-of-Great-Recession.pdf.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

The NBER examines a variety of measures of economic activity to gauge the overall health of the economy. These measures include real income, wholesale and retail sales, employment, and industrial production. In the years since the official end of this historic economic downturn, it has become clear that the Great Recession was two-pronged, hitting the U.S. economy with the collapse of the housing market and the failure of the financial system\\'s credit institutions, further contaminating global economies. While the stock market rapidly lost trillions of dollars of value, consumer spending dried up, and companies began cutting jobs, economic policymakers were struggling with how to best combat and prevent a national, and even global economic collapse. In the end, policymakers used a number of controversial monetary and fiscal policies to support the housing market and domestic industries as well as to stabilize the financial sector. Some of these initiatives included:\n\n* Federal Reserve Bank purchase of both traditional and nontraditional assets off banks\\' balance sheets. By doing this, the Fed injected money into the banking system and increased the amounts of funds available to lend to the business sector and consumers. This also dropped short-term interest rates to as low as zero percent and had the effect of devaluing U.S. dollars in the global market and boosting exports.\n* The Congress and the President also passed several pieces of legislation that would stabilize the financial market. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), passed in late 2008, allowed the government to inject cash into troubled banks and other financial institutions and help support General Motors and Chrysler as they faced bankruptcy and threatened job losses throughout their supply chain. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in early 2009 provided tax rebates to low- and middle-income households to encourage consumer spending.\n\nFour years after the end of the Great Recession, the economy has yet to return to its pre-recession levels of productivity and growth. Annual productivity increased only 1.9% between 2009 and 2012 compared to its 2.7% annual growth rate between 2000 and 2007, unemployment remains above the natural rate, and real GDP continues to lag behind potential growth. The actions taken to stabilize the economy are still under scrutiny and debate about their effectiveness continues. In this chapter, we will discuss the neoclassical perspective on economics and compare it to the Keynesian perspective. At the end of the chapter, we will use the neoclassical perspective to analyze the actions taken in the Great Recession.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to the Neoclassical Perspective\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* The Building Blocks of Neoclassical Analysis\n* The Policy Implications of the Neoclassical Perspective\n* Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical Models\n\n\n\nIn Chicago, Illinois, the highest recorded temperature was 105\u00b0 in July 1995, while the lowest recorded temperature was 27\u00b0 below zero in January 1958. Understanding why these extreme weather patterns occurred would be interesting. However, if you wanted to understand the typical weather pattern in Chicago, instead of focusing on one-time extremes, you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time.\n\nA similar lesson applies to the study of macroeconomics. It is interesting to study extreme situations, like the **Great Depression**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of the 1930s or what many have called the **Great Recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of 2008\u20132009. If you want to understand the whole picture, however, you need to look at the long term. Consider the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate has fluctuated from as low as 3.5% in 1969 to as high as 9.7% in 1982 and 9.6% in 2009. Even as the U.S. unemployment rate rose during recessions and declined during expansions, it kept returning to the general neighborhood of 5.0\u20135.5%. When the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office carried out its long-range economic forecasts in 2010, it assumed that from 2015 to 2020, after the recession has passed, the unemployment rate would be 5.0%. From a long-run perspective, the economy seems to keep adjusting back to this rate of unemployment.\n\nAs the name \u201cneoclassical\u201d implies, this perspective of how the macroeconomy works is a \u201cnew\u201d view of the \u201cold\u201d classical model of the economy. The classical view, the predominant economic philosophy until the Great Depression, was that short-term fluctuations in economic activity would rather quickly, with flexible prices, adjust back to full employment. This view of the economy implied a vertical aggregate supply curve at full employment GDP, and prescribed a \u201chands off\u201d policy approach. For example, if the economy were to slip into recession (a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve), it would temporarily exhibit a surplus of goods. This surplus would be eliminated with falling prices, and the economy would return to full employment level of GDP; no active fiscal or monetary policy was needed. In fact, the classical view was that expansionary fiscal or monetary policy would only cause inflation, rather than increase GDP. The deep and lasting impact of the Great Depression changed this thinking and Keynesian economics, which prescribed active fiscal policy to alleviate weak aggregate demand, became the more mainstream perspective.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

This chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics: (1) the size of the economy is determined by potential GDP, and (2) wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output. The key policy implication is this: Should the government focus more on long-term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment? This focus on long-run growth rather than the short-run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long-run macroeconomic analysis and **Keynesian economics**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run. Let\\'s consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn, and how they can be embodied in the **aggregate demand/aggregate supply model**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\n### The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run   {#ch26mod01_01}\n\nOver the long run, the level of potential GDP determines the size of real GDP. When economists refer to \u201cpotential GDP\u201d they are referring to that level of output that can be achieved when all resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability) are fully employed. While the unemployment rate in labor markets will never be zero, full employment in the labor market refers to zero cyclical unemployment. There will still be some level of unemployment due to frictional or structural unemployment, but when the economy is operating with zero cyclical unemployment, the economy is said to be at the natural rate of unemployment or at full employment.\n\nActual or **real GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is benchmarked against the **potential GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} to determine how well the economy is performing. Growth in GDP can be explained by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology. **Physical capital per person**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done. Compare, for example, your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software. Clearly, you will be able to be more productive using word processing software. The technology and level of capital of your laptop and software has increased your productivity. More broadly, the development of GPS technology and Universal Product Codes (those barcodes on every product we buy) has made it much easier for firms to track shipments, tabulate inventories, and sell and distribute products. These two technological innovations, and many others, have increased a nation\\'s ability to produce goods and services for a given population. Likewise, increasing human capital involves increasing levels of knowledge, education, and skill sets per person through vocational or higher education. Physical and human capital improvements with technological advances will increase overall productivity and, thus, GDP.\n\nTo see how these improvements have increased productivity and output at the national level, we should examine evidence from the United States. The United States experienced significant growth in the twentieth century due to phenomenal changes in infrastructure, equipment, and technological improvements in physical capital and human capital. The population more than tripled in the twentieth century, from 76 million in 1900 to over 300 million in 2012. The **human capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of modern workers is far higher today because the education and skills of workers have risen dramatically. In 1900, only about one-eighth of the U.S. population had completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a four-year college degree. By 2010, more than 87% of Americans had a high school degree and over 29% had a four-year college degree as well. In 2014, 40% of working-age Americans had a four-year college degree. The average amount of physical capital per worker has grown dramatically. The technology available to modern workers is extraordinarily better than a century ago: cars, airplanes, electrical machinery, smartphones, computers, chemical and biological advances, materials science, health care\u2014the list of technological advances could run on and on. More workers, higher skill levels, larger amounts of physical capital per worker, and amazingly better technology, and potential GDP for the U.S. economy has clearly increased a great deal since 1900.\n\nThis growth has fallen below its potential GDP and, at times, has exceeded its potential. For example from 2008 to 2009, the U.S. economy tumbled into recession and remains below its potential. At other times, like in the late 1990s, the economy ran at potential GDP\u2014or even slightly ahead. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C26_001) shows the actual data for the increase in nominal GDP since 1960. The slightly smoother line shows the potential GDP since 1960 as estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Most economic recessions and upswings are times when the economy is 1\u20133% below or above potential GDP in a given year. Clearly, short-run fluctuations around potential GDP do exist, but over the long run, the upward trend of potential GDP determines the size of the economy.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C26_001 data-title=\"Potential and Actual GDP (in Nominal Dollars)\"}\n\nIn the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model, potential GDP is shown as a vertical line. Neoclassical economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long-run aggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP\u2014that is, the long-run aggregate supply curve is a vertical line drawn at the level of potential GDP, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C26_002). A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of **aggregate supply**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (or potential GDP) will determine the real GDP of the economy, regardless of the level of **aggregate demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Over time, increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital, increases in human capital, and technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right. This gradual increase in an economy\\'s potential GDP is often described as a nation\\'s long-term economic growth.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C26_002 data-title=\"A Vertical AS Curve\"}\n\n### The Role of Flexible Prices   {#ch26mod01_02}\n\nHow does the macroeconomy adjust back to its level of potential GDP in the long run? What if aggregate demand increases or decreases? The neoclassical view of how the macroeconomy adjusts is based on the insight that even if wages and prices are \u201csticky\u201d, or slow to change, in the short run, they are flexible over time. To understand this better, let\\'s follow the connections from the short-run to the long-run macroeconomic equilibrium.\n\nThe aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C26_003) shows two aggregate supply curves. The original upward sloping aggregate supply curve (SRAS<sub>0</sub>) is a short-run or Keynesian AS curve. The vertical aggregate supply curve (LRASn) is the long-run or neoclassical AS curve, which is located at potential GDP. The original aggregate demand curve, labeled AD<sub>0</sub>, is drawn so that the original equilibrium occurs at point E<sub>0</sub>, at which point the economy is producing at its potential GDP.\n\n, at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD0) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts right from AD0 to AD1. The new equilibrium is E1, with a higher output level of 550 and an increase in the price level to 125. With unemployment rates unsustainably low, wages are bid up by eager employers, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the left, from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a higher price level of 130. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve (LRASn), which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, determines the level of real GDP in this economy in the long run.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C26_003 data-title=\"The Rebound to Potential GDP after AD Increases\"}\n\nNow, imagine that some economic event boosts aggregate demand: perhaps a surge of export sales or a rise in business confidence that leads to more investment, perhaps a policy decision like higher government spending, or perhaps a tax cut that leads to additional aggregate demand. The short-run Keynesian analysis is that the rise in aggregate demand will shift the aggregate demand curve out to the right, from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub>, leading to a new equilibrium at point E<sub>1</sub> with higher output, lower unemployment, and pressure for an inflationary rise in the price level.\n\nIn the long-run neoclassical analysis, however, the chain of economic events is just beginning. As economic output rises above potential GDP, the level of unemployment falls. The economy is now above full employment and there is a shortage of labor. Eager employers are trying to bid workers away from other companies and to encourage their current workers to exert more effort and to put in longer hours. This high demand for labor will drive up wages. Most workers have their salaries reviewed only once or twice a year, and so it will take time before the higher wages filter through the economy. As wages do rise, it will mean a leftward shift in the short-run Keynesian aggregate supply curve back to SRAS<sub>1</sub>, because the price of a major input to production has increased. The economy moves to a new equilibrium (E<sub>2</sub>). The new equilibrium has the same level of real GDP as did the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>), but there has been an inflationary increase in the price level.\n\nThis description of the short-run shift from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> and the long-run shift from E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub> is a step-by-step way of making a simple point: the economy cannot sustain production above its potential GDP in the long run. An economy may produce above its level of potential GDP in the short run, under pressure from a surge in aggregate demand. Over the long run, however, that surge in aggregate demand ends up as an increase in the price level, not as a rise in output.\n\nThe rebound of the economy back to potential GDP also works in response to a shift to the left in aggregate demand. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C26_004) again starts with two aggregate supply curves, with SRAS<sub>0</sub> showing the original upward sloping short-run Keynesian AS curve and LRASn showing the vertical long-run neoclassical aggregate supply curve. A decrease in aggregate demand\u2014for example, because of a decline in consumer confidence that leads to less consumption and more saving\u2014causes the original aggregate demand curve AD<sub>0</sub> to shift back to AD<sub>1</sub>. The shift from the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) to the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) results in a decline in output. The economy is now below full employment and there is a surplus of labor. As output falls below potential GDP, unemployment rises. While a lower price level (i.e., deflation) is rare in the United States, it does happen from time to time during very weak periods of economic activity. For practical purposes, we might consider a lower price level in the AD\u2013AS model as indicative of disinflation, which is a decline in the rate of inflation. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve LRASn, which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, ultimately determines the real GDP of this economy.\n\n, at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD0) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts left, from AD0 to AD1. The new equilibrium is at E1, with a lower output level of 450 and downward pressure on the price level of 115. With high unemployment rates, wages are held down. Lower wages are an economy-wide decrease in the price of a key input, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the right, from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a lower price level of 110.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C26_004 data-title=\"A Rebound Back to Potential GDP from a Shift to the Left in Aggregate Demand\"}\n\nAgain, from the neoclassical perspective, this short-run scenario is only the beginning of the chain of events. The higher level of unemployment means more workers looking for jobs. As a result, employers can hold down on pay increases\u2014or perhaps even replace some of their higher-paid workers with unemployed people willing to accept a lower wage. As wages stagnate or fall, this decline in the price of a key input means that the short-run Keynesian aggregate supply curve shifts to the right from its original (SRAS<sub>0</sub> to SRAS<sub>1</sub>). The overall impact in the long run, as the macroeconomic equilibrium shifts from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub>, is that the level of output returns to potential GDP, where it started. There is, however, downward pressure on the price level. Thus, in the neoclassical view, changes in aggregate demand can have a short-run impact on output and on unemployment\u2014but only a short-run impact. In the long run, when wages and prices are flexible, potential GDP and aggregate supply determine the size of real GDP.\n\n### How Fast Is the Speed of Macroeconomic Adjustment?   {#ch26mod01_03}\n\nHow long does it take for wages and prices to adjust, and for the economy to rebound back to its potential GDP? This subject is highly contentious. Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long time, then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical. In response to those immortal words of **John Maynard Keynes**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, \u201cIn the long run we are all dead,\u201d neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as, say, ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy.\n\nOne subset of neoclassical economists holds that the adjustment of wages and prices in the macroeconomy might be quite rapid indeed. The theory of **rational expectations**{: data-type=\"term\"} holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can, using all information available to them. In an economy where most people have rational expectations, economic adjustments may happen very quickly.\n\nTo understand how rational expectations may affect the speed of price adjustments, think about a situation in the real estate market. Imagine that several events seem likely to push up the value of homes in the neighborhood. Perhaps a local employer announces that it is going to hire many more people or the city announces that it is going to build a local park or a library in that neighborhood. The theory of rational expectations points out that even though none of the changes will happen immediately, home prices in the neighborhood will rise immediately, because the expectation that homes will be worth more in the future will lead buyers to be willing to pay more in the present. The amount of the immediate increase in home prices will depend on how likely it seems that the announcements about the future will actually happen and on how distant the local jobs and neighborhood improvements are in the future. The key point is that, because of rational expectations, prices do not wait on events, but adjust immediately.\n\nAt a macroeconomic level, the theory of rational expectations points out that if the aggregate supply curve is vertical over time, then people should rationally expect this pattern. When a shift in aggregate demand occurs, people and businesses with rational expectations will know that its impact on output and employment will be temporary, while its impact on the price level will be permanent. If firms and workers perceive the outcome of the process in advance, and if all firms and workers know that everyone else is perceiving the process in the same way, then they have no incentive to go through an extended series of short-run scenarios, like a firm first hiring more people when aggregate demand shifts out and then firing those same people when aggregate supply shifts back. Instead, everyone will recognize where this process is heading\u2014toward a change in the price level\u2014and then will act on that expectation. In this scenario, the expected long-run change in the price level may happen very quickly, without a drawn-out zigzag of output and employment first moving one way and then the other.\n\nThe theory that people and firms have rational expectations can be a useful simplification, but as a statement about how people and businesses actually behave, the assumption seems too strong. After all, many people and firms are not especially well informed, either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works. An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with **adaptive expectations**{: data-type=\"term\"}\\: they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change, but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory. If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations, then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time.\n\nThe empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear-cut. Indeed, the speed of macroeconomic adjustment probably varies among different countries and time periods. A reasonable guess is that the initial short-run effect of a shift in aggregate demand might last two to five years, before the adjustments in wages and prices cause the economy to adjust back to potential GDP. Thus, one might think of the short run for applying Keynesian analysis as time periods less than two to five years, and the long run for applying neoclassical analysis as longer than five years. For practical purposes, this guideline is frustratingly imprecise, but when analyzing a complex social mechanism like an economy as it evolves over time, some imprecision seems unavoidable.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch26mod01_summ}\n\nNeoclassical perspective argues that, in the long run, the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output through flexible price levels. Thus, the neoclassical perspective views the long-run AS curve as vertical. A rational expectations perspective argues that people have excellent information about economic events and how the economy works and that, as a result, price and other economic adjustments will happen very quickly. In adaptive expectations theory, people have limited information about economic information and how the economy works, and so price and other economic adjustments can be slow.\n\n### Self-Check Question   {#ch26mod01_sques}\n\n\n\nDo rational expectations tend to look back at past experience while adaptive expectations look ahead to the future? Explain your answer.\n\n\n\nNo, this statement is false. It would be more accurate to say that rational expectations seek to predict the future as accurately as possible, using all of past experience as a guide. Adaptive expectations are largely backward looking; that is, they adapt as experience accumulates, but without attempting to look forward.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch26mod01_rques}\n\n\n\nDoes neoclassical economics focus on the long term or the short term? Explain your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes neoclassical economics view prices and wages as sticky or flexible? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat shape is the long-run aggregate supply curve? Why does it have this shape?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between rational expectations and adaptive expectations?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA neoclassical economist and a Keynesian economist are studying the economy of Vineland. It appears that Vineland is beginning to experience a mild recession with a decrease in aggregate demand. Which of these two economists would likely advocate that the government of Vineland take active measures to reverse this decline in aggregate demand? Why?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#ch26mod01_ctques}\n\n\n\nIf most people have rational expectations, how long will recessions last?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain why the neoclassical economists believe that nothing much needs to be done about unemployment.

Suppose a decrease in aggregate demand causes the economy to go into recession with high unemployment. The Keynesian response would be to use government policy to stimulate aggregate demand and eliminate the recessionary gap. The neoclassical economists believe that the Keynesian response, while perhaps well intentioned, will not have a good outcome for reasons we will discuss shortly. Since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time, the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy would be to speed up the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work. Is that the likely outcome?\n\nKeynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the ability of the government to recognize a situation of too little or too much **aggregate demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending, all enacted in a timely fashion. After all, neoclassical economists argue, it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring\u2014and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later. Moreover, there is the question of timely action. The political process can take more months to enact a tax cut or a spending increase; the amount of those tax or spending changes may be determined as much by political considerations as economic ones; and then the economy will take still more months to put changes in aggregate demand into effect through spending and production. When all of these time lags and political realities are considered, active fiscal policy may fail to address the current problem, and could even make the future economy worse. The average U.S. post-World War II recession has lasted only about a year. By the time government policy kicks in, the recession will likely be over. As a consequence, the only result of government fine-tuning will be to stimulate the economy when it is already recovering (or to contract the economy when it is already falling). In other words, an active macroeconomic policy is likely to exacerbate the cycles rather than dampen them. Indeed, some neoclassical economists believe a large part of the business cycles we observe are due to flawed government policy. To learn about this issue further, read the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\nWhy and how are inflation expectations measured?\n\nPeople take expectations about inflation into consideration every time they make a major purchase, such as a house or a car. As inflation fluctuates, so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods. The nominal interest rate is comprised of the real rate, plus an **expected inflation**{: data-type=\"term\"} factor. Expected inflation also tells economists about how the public views the direction of the economy. Suppose the public expects inflation to increase. This could be the result of positive demand shock due to an expanding economy and increasing aggregate demand. It could also be the result of a negative supply shock, perhaps from rising energy prices, and decreasing aggregate supply. In either case, the public may expect the central bank to engage in contractionary monetary policy to reduce inflation, and this policy results in higher interest rates. If, on the other hand, inflation is expected to decrease, the public may anticipate a recession. In turn, the public may expect expansionary monetary policy, and the lowering of interest rates, in the short run. By monitoring expected inflation, economists garner information about the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies. Additionally, monitoring expected inflation allows for projecting the direction of real interest rates that isolate for the effect of inflation. This information is necessary for making decisions about financing investments.\n\nExpectations about inflation may seem like a highly theoretical concept, but, in fact, inflation expectations are measured by the Federal Reserve Bank based upon early research conducted by Joseph Livingston, a financial journalist for the *Philadelphia Inquirer*. In 1946, he started a twice-a-year survey of economists about their expectations of inflation. After Livingston\\'s death in 1969, the survey was continued by the Federal Reserve Bank and other economic research agencies such as the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, the American Statistical Association, and the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n\nCurrent research by the Federal Reserve compares these expectations to actual inflation that has occurred, and the results, so far, are mixed. Economists\\' forecasts, however, have become notably more accurate in the last few decades. Economists are actively researching how expectations of inflation and other economic variables are formed and changed.\n\n\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read \u201cThe Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland\u2019s Economic Commentary: A New Approach to Gauging Inflation Expectations\u201d by Joseph G.

The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips curve; thus, there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run. By contrast, a neoclassical long-run aggregate supply curve will imply a vertical shape for the Phillips curve, indicating no long run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C26_012) (a) shows the vertical AS curve, with three different levels of aggregate demand, resulting in three different equilibria, at three different price levels. At every point along that vertical AS curve, potential GDP and the rate of unemployment remains the same. Assume that for this economy, the natural rate of unemployment is 5%. As a result, the long-run Phillips curve relationship, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C26_012) (b), is a vertical line, rising up from 5% unemployment, at any level of inflation. Read the following Work It Out feature for additional information on how to interpret inflation and unemployment rates.\n\n With a vertical LRAS curve, shifts in aggregate demand do not alter the level of output but do lead to changes in the price level. Because output is unchanged between the equilibria E0, E1, and E2, all unemployment in this economy will be due to the natural rate of unemployment. (b) If the natural rate of unemployment is 5%, then the Phillips curve will be vertical. That is, regardless of changes in the price level, the unemployment rate remains at 5%.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C26_012 data-title=\"From a Long-Run AS Curve to a Long-Run Phillips Curve\"}\n\n\n\nTracking Inflation and Unemployment Rates\n\nSuppose that you have collected data for years on the rates of inflation and unemployment and recorded them in a table, such as [\\[link\\]](#ch26mod02_tab02). How do you interpret that information?\n\n| Year | Inflation Rate | Unemployment Rate |\n|----------\n| 1970 | 2% | 4% |\n| 1975 | 3% | 3% |\n| 1980 | 2% | 4% |\n| 1985 | 1% | 6% |\n| 1990 | 1% | 4% |\n| 1995 | 4% | 2% |\n| 2000 | 5% | 4% |\n{: #ch26mod02_tab02 summary=\"The table shows data for rates of inflation and unemployment over the course of 25 years.

The year 1980 = 2% inflation; 4% unemployment. The year 1985 = 1% inflation; 6% unemployment. The year 1990 = 1% inflation; 4% unemployment. The year 1995 = 4% inflation; 2% unemployment. The year 2000 = 5% inflation; 4% unemployment.\"}\n\nStep 1. Plot the data points in a graph with inflation rate on the vertical axis and unemployment rate on the horizontal axis. Your graph will appear similar to [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C26_013).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C26_013 data-title=\"Inflation Rates\"}\n\n\nStep 2. What patterns do you see in the data? You should notice that there are years when unemployment falls but inflation rises, and other years where unemployment rises and inflation falls.\n\nStep 3. Can you determine the natural rate of unemployment from the data or from the graph? As you analyze the graph, it appears that the natural rate of unemployment lies at 4%; this is the rate that the economy appears to adjust back to after an apparent change in the economy. For example, in 1975 the economy appeared to have an increase in aggregate demand; the unemployment rate fell to 3% but inflation increased from 2% to 3%. By 1980, the economy had adjusted back to 4% unemployment and the inflation rate had returned to 2%. In 1985, the economy looks to have suffered a recession as unemployment rose to 6% and inflation fell to 1%. This would be consistent with a decrease in aggregate demand. By 1990, the economy recovered back to 4% unemployment, but at a lower inflation rate of 1%. In 1995 the economy again rebounded and unemployment fell to 2%, but inflation increased to 4%, which is consistent with a large increase in aggregate demand. The economy adjusted back to 4% unemployment but at a higher rate of inflation of 5%. Then in 2000, both unemployment and inflation increased to 5% and 4%, respectively.\n\nStep 4. Do you see the Phillips curve(s) in the data? If we trace the downward sloping trend of data points, we could see a short-run Phillips curve that exhibits the inverse tradeoff between higher unemployment and lower inflation rates. If we trace the vertical line of data points, we could see a long-run Phillips curve at the 4% natural rate of unemployment.\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate on the long-run Phillips curve will be the natural rate of unemployment. A small inflationary increase in the price level from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub> will have the same natural rate of unemployment as a larger inflationary increase in the price level from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>2</sub>. The macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels, and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation. The great economist **Milton Friedman**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (1912\u20132006) summed up the neoclassical view of the long-term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech: \u201c\\[T\\]here is always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment; there is no permanent trade-off.\u201d\n\nIn the Keynesian perspective, the primary focus is on getting the level of aggregate demand right in relationship to an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve. That is, AD should be adjusted so that the economy produces at its potential GDP, not so low that cyclical unemployment results and not so high that inflation results. In the neoclassical perspective, aggregate supply will determine output at potential GDP, unemployment is determined by the natural rate of unemployment churned out by the forces of supply and demand in the labor market, and shifts in aggregate demand are the primary determinant of changes in the price level.\n\n\nVisit this [website][2] to read about the effects of economic intervention.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch26mod02_link02m\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Fighting Unemployment or Inflation?   {#ch26mod02_02}\n\nAs explained in [Unemployment](/m48719){: .target-chapter}, unemployment can be divided into two categories: **cyclical unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and the **natural rate of unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which is the sum of frictional and structural unemployment. Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below potential GDP\u2014giving potential employers less incentive to hire. When the economy is producing at potential GDP, cyclical unemployment will be zero. Because of the dynamics of the labor market, in which people are always entering or exiting the labor force, the unemployment rate never falls to 0%, not even when the economy is producing at or even slightly above potential GDP. Probably the best we can hope for is for the number of job vacancies to equal the number of job seekers. We know that it takes time for job seekers and employers to find each other, and this time is the cause of frictional unemployment. Most economists do not consider frictional unemployment to be a \u201cbad\u201d thing. After all, there will always be workers who are unemployed while looking for a job that is a better match for their skills. There will always be employers that have an open position, while looking for a worker that is a better match for the job. Ideally, these matches happen quickly, but even when the economy is very strong there will be some natural unemployment and this is what is measured by the natural rate of unemployment.\n\nThe neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus attention away from the problem of cyclical unemployment\u2014that is, unemployment caused by recession\u2014while putting more attention on the issue of the rates of unemployment that prevail even when the economy is operating at potential GDP. To put it another way, the neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus on how public policy can be adjusted to reduce the natural rate of unemployment. Such policy changes might involve redesigning unemployment and welfare programs so that they support those in need, but also offer greater encouragement for job-hunting. It might involve redesigning business rules with an eye to whether they are unintentionally discouraging businesses from taking on new employees. It might involve building institutions to improve the flow of information about jobs and the mobility of workers, to help bring workers and employers together more quickly. For those workers who find that their skills are permanently no longer in demand (for example, the structurally unemployed), policy can be designed to provide opportunities for retraining so that these workers can reenter the labor force and seek employment.\n\nNeoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment; after all, if economic output is determined by a vertical **aggregate supply curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, then aggregate demand has no long-run effect on unemployment. Instead, neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right\u2014keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low.\n\nIf **aggregate demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} rises rapidly in the neoclassical model, in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C26_005) shows a vertical LRAS curve and three different levels of aggregate demand, rising from AD<sub>0</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub> to AD<sub>2</sub>. As the macroeconomic equilibrium rises from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>2</sub>, the price level rises, but real GDP does not budge; nor does the rate of unemployment, which adjusts to its natural rate. Conversely, reducing inflation has no long-term costs, either. Think about [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C26_005) in reverse, as the aggregate demand curve shifts from AD<sub>2</sub> to AD<sub>1</sub> to AD<sub>0</sub>, and the equilibrium moves from E<sub>2</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> to E<sub>0</sub>. During this process, the price level falls, but, in the long run, neither real GDP nor the natural rate of unemployment is changed.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C26_005 data-title=\"How Aggregate Demand Determines the Price Level in the Long Run\"}\n\n\nVisit this [website][3] to read about how inflation and unemployment are related.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"ch26mod02_link03m\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Fighting Recession or Encouraging Long-Term Growth?   {#ch26mod02_03}\n\nNeoclassical economists believe that the economy will rebound out of a recession or eventually contract during an expansion because prices and wage rates are flexible and will adjust either upward or downward to restore the economy to its potential GDP. Thus, the key policy question for neoclassicals is how to promote growth of potential GDP. We know that economic growth ultimately depends on the growth rate of long-term productivity. Productivity measures how effective inputs are at producing outputs. We know that U.S. productivity has grown on average about 2% per year. That means that the same amount of inputs produce 2% more output than the year before. We also know that productivity growth varies a great deal in the short term due to cyclical factors. It also varies somewhat in the long term. From 1953\u20131972, U.S. labor productivity (as measured by output per hour in the business sector) grew at 3.2% per year. From 1973\u20131992, productivity growth declined significantly to 1.8% per year. Then, from 1993\u20132014, productivity growth increased slightly to 2% per year. The neoclassical economists believe the underpinnings of long-run productivity growth to be an economy\u2019s investments in human capital, physical capital, and technology, operating together in a market-oriented environment that rewards innovation. Promotion of these factors is what government policy should focus on.\n\n### Summary of Neoclassical Macroeconomic Policy Recommendations   {#ch26mod02_04}\n\nLet\u2019s summarize what neoclassical economists recommend for macroeconomic policy. Neoclassical economists do not believe in \u201cfine-tuning\u201d the economy. They believe that economic growth is fostered by a stable economic environment with a low rate of inflation. Similarly, tax rates should be low and unchanging. In this environment, private economic agents can make the best possible investment decisions, which will lead to optimal investment in physical and human capital as well as research and development to promote improvements in technology.\n\n### Summary of Neoclassical Economics versus Keynesian Economics   {#ch26mod02_05}\n\n[\\[link\\]](#ch24mod02_tab03) summarizes the key differences between the two schools of thought.\n\n<table id=\"ch24mod02_tab03\" summary=\"The table shows the key differences between Neoclassical Economics and Keynesian Economics.

They tend to focus more on reducing the natural rate of unemployment caused by economic institutions and government policies than the cyclical unemployment caused by recession.\n\nNeoclassical economists also see no social benefit to inflation. With an upward-sloping Keynesian AS curve, inflation can arise because an economy is approaching full employment. With a vertical long-run neoclassical AS curve, inflation does not accompany any rise in output. If aggregate supply is vertical, then aggregate demand does not affect the quantity of output. Instead, aggregate demand can only cause inflationary changes in the price level. A vertical aggregate supply curve, where the quantity of output is consistent with many different price levels, also implies a vertical Phillips curve.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#ch26mod02_sques}\n\n\n\nLegislation proposes that the government should use macroeconomic policy to achieve an unemployment rate of zero percent, by increasing aggregate demand for as much and as long as necessary to accomplish this goal. From a neoclassical perspective, how will this policy affect output and the price level in the short run and in the long run? Sketch an aggregate demand/aggregate supply diagram to illustrate your answer. *Hint*: revisit [[link]](/m48758#CNX_Econ_C26_003).\n\n\n\nAn unemployment rate of zero percent is presumably well below the rate that is consistent with potential GDP and with the natural rate of unemployment. As a result, this policy would be attempting to push AD out to the right.\n\nIn the short run, it is possible to have unemployment slightly below the natural rate for a time, at a price of higher inflation, as shown by the movement from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub> along the short-run AS curve. However, over time the extremely low unemployment rates will tend to cause wages to be bid up, and shift the short-run AS curve back to the left. The result would be a higher price level, but an economy still at potential GDP and the natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the long-run AS curve. If the government continues this policy, it will continually be pushing the price level higher and higher, but it will not be able to achieve its goal of zero percent unemployment, because that goal is inconsistent with market forces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWould it make sense to argue that rational expectations economics is an extreme version of neoclassical economics? Explain.\n\n\n\nThe statement is accurate. Rational expectations can be thought of as a version of neoclassical economics because it argues that potential GDP and the rate of unemployment are shaped by market forces as wages and prices adjust. However, it is an \u201cextreme\u201d version because it argues that this adjustment takes place very quickly. Other theories, like adaptive expectations, suggest that adjustment to the neoclassical outcome takes a few years.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch26mod02_rques}\n\n\n\nDo neoclassical economists tend to focus more on long term economic growth or on recessions? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo neoclassical economists tend to focus more on cyclical unemployment or on inflation? Explain briefly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo neoclassical economists see a value in tolerating a little more inflation if it brings additional economic output?

In determining the price level?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the shape of the neoclassical long-run Phillips curve?

The \u201cStimulus Package\u201d was arguably a Keynesian measure so why would a Keynesian economist be critical of it? Why would neoclassical economists be critical?\n\n\n\n\n### References   {#ch26mod02_ref}\n\nAmerican Statistical Association. \u201cASA Headlines.\u201d http://www.amstat.org/.\n\nHaubrich, Joseph G., George Pennacchi, and Peter Ritchken. \u201cWorking Paper 11-07: Inflation Expectations, Real Rates, and Risk Premia: Evidence from Inflation Swaps.\u201d *Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland*.

When a circus performer stands on two horses, with a foot on each one, much of the excitement for the viewer lies in contemplating the gap between the two. As modern macroeconomists ride into the future on two horses\u2014with one foot on the short-term Keynesian perspective and one foot on the long-term neoclassical perspective\u2014the balancing act may look uncomfortable, but there does not seem to be any way to avoid it. Each approach, Keynesian and neoclassical, has its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe short-term Keynesian model, built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity, does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. By focusing on the short-run adjustments of aggregate demand, **Keynesian economics**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} risks overlooking the long-term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment that exists even when the economy is producing at potential GDP.\n\nThe neoclassical model, with its emphasis on aggregate supply, focuses on the underlying determinants of output and employment in markets, and thus tends to put more emphasis on economic growth and how labor markets work. However, the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of a few years. Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long-lasting recession, like the **Great Depression**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of the 1930s. Keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment.\n\nMacroeconomics cannot, however, be summed up as an argument between one group of economists who are pure Keynesians and another group who are pure neoclassicists. Instead, many mainstream economists believe both the Keynesian and neoclassical perspectives. **Robert Solow**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the Nobel laureate in economics in 1987, described the dual approach in this way:\n\n<q>At short time scales, I think, something sort of \u2018Keynesian\u2019 is a good approximation, and surely better than anything straight \u2018neoclassical.\u2019 At very long time scales, the interesting questions are best studied in a neoclassical framework, and attention to the Keynesian side of things would be a minor distraction. At the five-to-ten-year time scale, we have to piece things together as best we can, and look for a hybrid model that will do the job.</q>\n\nMany modern macroeconomists spend considerable time and energy trying to construct models that blend the most attractive aspects of the Keynesian and neoclassical approaches. It is possible to construct a somewhat complex mathematical model where aggregate demand and sticky wages and prices matter in the short run, but wages, prices, and aggregate supply adjust in the long run. However, creating an overall model that encompasses both short-term Keynesian and long-term neoclassical models is not easy.\n\n\n\nNavigating Unchartered Waters\n\nWere the policies implemented to stabilize the economy and financial markets during the Great Recession effective? Many economists from both the Keynesian and neoclassical schools have found that they were, although to varying degrees. Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Mark Zandi for Moody\u2019s Analytics found that, without fiscal policy, GDP decline would have been significantly more than its 3.3% in 2008 followed by its 0.1% decline in 2009. They also estimated that there would have been 8.5 million more job losses had the government not intervened in the market with the TARP to support the financial industry and key automakers General Motors and Chrysler. Federal Reserve Bank economists Carlos Carvalho, Stefano Eusip, and Christian Grisse found in their study, *Policy Initiatives in the Global Recession: What Did Forecasters Expect?* that once policies were implemented, forecasters adapted their expectations to these policies. They were more likely to anticipate increases in investment due to lower interest rates brought on by monetary policy and increased economic growth resulting from fiscal policy.\n\nThe difficulty with evaluating the effectiveness of the stabilization policies that were taken in response to the Great Recession is that we will never know what would have happened had those policies not have been implemented. Surely some of the programs were more effective at creating and saving jobs, while other programs were less so. The final conclusion on the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies is still up for debate, and further study will no doubt consider the impact of these policies on the U.S. budget and deficit, as well as the value of the U.S. dollar in the financial market.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#ch26mod03_summ}\n\nThe Keynesian perspective considers changes to aggregate demand to be the cause of business cycle fluctuations. Keynesians are likely to advocate that policy makers actively attempt to reverse recessionary and inflationary periods because they are not convinced that the self-correcting economy can easily return to full employment.\n\nThe neoclassical perspective places more emphasis on aggregate supply. The level of potential GDP is determined by long term productivity growth and that the economy typically will return to full employment after a change in aggregate demand. Skeptical of the effectiveness and timeliness of Keynesian policy, neoclassical economists are more likely to advocate a hands-off, or fairly limited, role for active stabilization policy.\n\nWhile Keynesians would tend to advocate an acceptable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when counteracting a recession, neoclassical economists argue that no such tradeoff exists; any short-term gains in lower unemployment will eventually vanish and the result of active policy will only be inflation.\n\n### Self-Check Question   {#ch26mod03_sques}\n\n\n\nSummarize the Keynesian and Neoclassical models.\n\n\n\nThe short-term Keynesian model is built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity, and thus does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. The neoclassical model emphasizes aggregate supply by focusing on the underlying determinants of output and employment in markets, and thus tends to put more emphasis on economic growth and how labor markets work.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#ch26mod03_rques}\n\n\n\nWhen the economy is experiencing a recession, why would a neoclassical economist be unlikely to argue for aggressive policy to stimulate aggregate demand and return the economy to full employment?

The answer is not gold, silver, or any precious metal. It is the cowrie, a mollusk shell found mainly off the Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean. Cowries served as money as early as 700 B.C. in China. By the 1500s, they were in widespread use across India and Africa. For several centuries after that, cowries were used in markets including southern Europe, western Africa, India, and China for a wide range of purchases: everything from buying lunch or a ferry ride to paying for a shipload of silk or rice. Cowries were still acceptable as a way of paying taxes in certain African nations in the early twentieth century.\n\nWhat made cowries work so well as money? First, they are extremely durable\u2014lasting a century or more. As the late economic historian Karl Polyani put it, they can be \u201cpoured, sacked, shoveled, hoarded in heaps\u201d while remaining \u201cclean, dainty, stainless, polished, and milk-white.\u201d Second, parties could use cowries either by counting shells of a certain size, or\u2014for large purchases\u2014by measuring the weight or volume of the total shells to be exchanged. Third, it was impossible to counterfeit a cowrie shell, but gold or silver coins could be counterfeited by making copies with cheaper metals. Finally, in the heyday of cowrie money, from the 1500s into the 1800s, the collection of cowries was tightly controlled, first by the Portuguese and later by the Dutch and the English. As a result, the supply of cowries was allowed to grow quickly enough to serve the needs of commerce, but not so quickly that they were no longer scarce. Money throughout the ages has taken many different forms and continues to evolve even today. What do you think money is?\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Money and Banking\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Defining Money by Its Functions\n* Measuring Money: Currency, M1, and M2\n* The Role of Banks\n* How Banks Create Money\n\n\n\nThe discussion of money and banking is a central component in the study of macroeconomics. At this point, you should have firmly in mind the main goals of macroeconomics from [Welcome to Economics!](/m48590)\\: **economic growth**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, low **unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, and low **inflation**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.

With the goals and frameworks for macroeconomic analysis in mind, the final step is to discuss the two main categories of macroeconomic policy: monetary policy, which focuses on money, banking and interest rates; and fiscal policy, which focuses on government spending, taxes, and borrowing. This chapter discusses what economists mean by money, and how money is closely interrelated with the banking system.

{"module_id": "m48762", "module_title": "Economics - m48762", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48762", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Explain the various functions of money\n* Contrast commodity money and fiat money\n\n\n\nMoney for the sake of money is not an end in itself. You cannot eat dollar bills or wear your bank account. Ultimately, the usefulness of money rests in exchanging it for goods or services. As the American writer and humorist Ambrose Bierce (1842\u20131914) wrote in 1911, money is a \u201cblessing that is of no advantage to us excepting when we part with it.\u201d Money is what people regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and services, and thus money must be widely accepted by both buyers and sellers. This concept of money is intentionally flexible, because money has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures.\n\n### Barter and the Double Coincidence of Wants\n\nTo understand the usefulness of money, we must consider what the world would be like without money. How would people exchange goods and services? Economies without money typically engage in the barter system. **Barter**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014literally trading one good or service for another\u2014is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy. In an economy without money, an exchange between two people would involve a **double coincidence of wants**{: data-type=\"term\"}, a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide. For example, if an accountant wants a pair of shoes, this accountant must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting services. Such a trade is likely to be difficult to arrange. Think about the complexity of such trades in a modern economy, with its extensive division of labor that involves thousands upon thousands of different jobs and goods.\n\nAnother problem with the barter system is that it does not allow us to easily enter into future contracts for the purchase of many goods and services. For example, if the goods are perishable it may be difficult to exchange them for other goods in the future. Imagine a farmer wanting to buy a tractor in six months using a fresh crop of strawberries. Additionally, while the barter system might work adequately in small economies, it will keep these economies from growing. The time that individuals would otherwise spend producing goods and services and enjoying leisure time is spent bartering.\n\n### Functions for Money\n\nMoney solves the problems created by the barter system. (We will get to its definition soon.) First, money serves as a **medium of exchange**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller. Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes, the accountant now exchanges accounting services for money. This money is then used to buy shoes. To serve as a medium of exchange, money must be very widely accepted as a method of payment in the markets for goods, labor, and financial capital.\n\nSecond, money must serve as a **store of value**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In a barter system, we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services. But she risks having her shoes go out of style, especially if she keeps them in a warehouse for future use\u2014their value will decrease with each season. Shoes are not a good store of value. Holding money is a much easier way of storing value. You know that you do not need to spend it immediately because it will still hold its value the next day, or the next year. This function of money does not require that money is a *perfect* store of value. In an economy with inflation, money loses some buying power each year, but it remains money.\n\nThird, money serves as a **unit of account**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which means that it is the ruler by which other values are measured. For example, an accountant may charge $100 to file your tax return. That $100 can purchase two pair of shoes at $50 a pair. Money acts as a common denominator, an accounting method that simplifies thinking about trade-offs.\n\nFinally, another function of money is that money must serve as a **standard of deferred payment**{: data-type=\"term\"}. This means that if money is usable today to make purchases, it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that will be paid in the *future*. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future. So **money**{: data-type=\"term\"} serves all of these functions\u2014 it is a medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account, and standard of deferred payment.\n\n### Commodity versus Fiat Money\n\nMoney has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures. Gold, silver, cowrie shells, cigarettes, and even cocoa beans have been used as money. Although these items are used as **commodity money**{: data-type=\"term\"}, they also have a value from use as something other than money. Gold, for example, has been used throughout the ages as money although today it is not used as money but rather is valued for its other attributes. Gold is a good conductor of electricity and is used in the electronics and aerospace industry. Gold is also used in the manufacturing of energy efficient reflective glass for skyscrapers and is used in the medical industry as well. Of course, gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in the creation of jewelry.\n\nAs commodity money, gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and as a unit of account. **Commodity-backed currencies**{: data-type=\"term\"} are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodity held at a bank. During much of its history, the money supply in the United States was backed by gold and silver. Interestingly, antique dollars dated as late as 1957, have \u201cSilver Certificate\u201d printed over the portrait of George Washington, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_003). This meant that the holder could take the bill to the appropriate bank and exchange it for a dollar\u2019s worth of silver.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C27_003 data-title=\"A Silver Certificate and a Modern U.S. Bill\"}\n\nAs economies grew and became more global in nature, the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome. Countries moved towards the use of **fiat money**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Fiat money has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be the legal tender of a country. The United States\u2019 paper money, for example, carries the statement: \u201cTHIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.\u201d In other words, by government decree, if you owe a debt, then legally speaking, you can pay that debt with the U.S. currency, even though it is not backed by a commodity. The only backing of our money is universal faith and trust that the currency has value, and nothing more.\n\n\nWatch this [video][1] on the \u201cHistory of Money.\u201d\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nMoney is what people in a society regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and services. If money were not available, people would need to barter with each other, meaning that each person would need to identify others with whom they have a double coincidence of wants\u2014that is, each party has a specific good or service that the other desires. Money serves several functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value, and a standard of deferred payment. There are two types of money: commodity money, which is an item used as money, but which also has value from its use as something other than money; and fiat money, which has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be the legal tender of a country.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIn many casinos, a person buys chips to use for gambling. Within the walls of the casino, these chips can often be used to buy food and drink or even a hotel room. Do chips in a gambling casino serve all three functions of money?\n\n\n\nAs long as you remain within the walls of the casino, chips fit the definition of money; that is, they serve as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value. Chips do not work very well as money once you leave the casino, but many kinds of money do not work well in other areas. For example, it is hard to spend money from Turkey or Brazil at your local supermarket or at the movie theater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan you name some item that is a store of value, but does not serve the other functions of money?\n\n\n\nMany physical items that a person buys at one time but may sell at another time can serve as an answer to this question. Examples include a house, land, art, rare coins or stamps, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are the four functions served by money?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the existence of money simplify the process of buying and selling?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the double-coincidence of wants?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nThe Bring it Home Feature discusses the use of cowrie shells as money. Although cowrie shells are no longer used as money, do you think other forms of commodity monies are possible? What role might technology play in our definition of money?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine that you are a barber in a world without money. Explain why it would be tricky to obtain groceries, clothing, and a place to live.\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nHogendorn, Jan and Marion Johnson. *The Shell Money of the Slave Trade*.

But what about checks or credit cards? Are they money, too? Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money, economists offer broader definitions of money based on liquidity. **Liquidity**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} refers to how quickly a financial asset can be used to buy a good or service. For example, cash is very liquid. Your $10 bill can be easily used to buy a hamburger at lunchtime. However, $10 that you have in your savings account is not so easy to use. You must go to the bank or ATM machine and withdraw that cash to buy your lunch. Thus, $10 in your savings account is *less* liquid.\n\nThe **Federal Reserve Bank**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which is the central bank of the United States, is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity. There are two definitions of money: M1 and M2 money supply. **M1 money supply**{: data-type=\"term\"} includes those monies that are very liquid such as cash, checkable (demand) deposits, and traveler\u2019s checks **M2 money supply**{: data-type=\"term\"} is less liquid in nature and includes M1 plus savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits, and money market funds.\n\nM1 money supply includes **coins and currency in circulation**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that are not held by the U.S. Treasury, at the Federal Reserve Bank, or in bank vaults. Closely related to currency are checkable deposits, also known as **demand deposits**{: data-type=\"term\"}. These are the amounts held in checking accounts. They are called demand deposits or checkable deposits because the banking institution must give the deposit holder his money \u201con demand\u201d when a check is written or a debit card is used. These items together\u2014currency, and checking accounts in banks\u2014make up the definition of money known as M1, which is measured daily by the Federal Reserve System. Traveler\u2019s checks are a also included in M1, but have decreased in use over the recent past.\n\nA broader definition of money, M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits. For example, M2 includes **savings deposits**{: data-type=\"term\"} in banks, which are bank accounts on which you cannot write a check directly, but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank. Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in **money market funds**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where the deposits of many individual investors are pooled together and invested in a safe way, such as short-term government bonds. Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small (that is, less than about $100,000) **certificates of deposit (CDs)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} or **time deposits**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time, ranging from a few months to a few years, in exchange for a higher interest rate. In short, all these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend, but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in M1 [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_001) should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2.

M2 = M1 + savings deposits + money market funds + certificates of deposit + other time deposits.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C27_001 data-title=\"The Relationship between M1 and M2 Money \"}\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is responsible for tracking the amounts of M1 and M2 and prepares a weekly release of information about the money supply. To provide an idea of what these amounts sound like, according to the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s measure of the U.S. money stock, at the end of February 2015, M1 in the United States was $3 trillion, while M2 was $11.8 trillion. A breakdown of the portion of each type of money that comprised M1 and M2 in February 2015, as provided by the Federal Reserve Bank, is provided in [\\[link\\]](#Table_27_01).\n\n<table id=\"Table_27_01\" summary=\"This table has two columns and nine rows.

Sometimes elements of M1 are not treated alike; for example, some businesses will not accept personal checks for large amounts, but will accept traveler\u2019s checks or cash. Changes in banking practices and technology have made the savings accounts in M2 more similar to the checking accounts in M1. For example, some savings accounts will allow depositors to write checks, use automatic teller machines, and pay bills over the Internet, which has made it easier to access savings accounts. As with many other economic terms and statistics, the important point is to know the strengths and limitations of the various definitions of money, not to believe that such definitions are as clear-cut to economists as, say, the definition of nitrogen is to chemists.\n\nWhere does \u201cplastic money\u201d like debit cards, credit cards, and smart money fit into this picture? A **debit card**{: data-type=\"term\"}, like a check, is an instruction to the user\u2019s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller. It is important to note that in our definition of money, it is*checkable deposits* that are money, not the paper check or the debit card. Although you can make a purchase with a **credit card**{: data-type=\"term\"}, it is not considered money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you. When you make a purchase with a credit card, the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller, and at the end of the month, the credit card company sends you a bill for what you have charged that month. Until you pay the credit card bill, you have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company. With a **smart card**{: data-type=\"term\"}, you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases. Some \u201csmart cards\u201d used for specific purposes, like long-distance phone calls or making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria, are not really all that smart, because they can only be used for certain purchases or in certain places.\n\nIn short, credit cards, debit cards, and smart cards are different ways to move money when a purchase is made. But having more credit cards or debit cards does not change the quantity of money in the economy, any more than having more checks printed increases the amount of money in your checking account.\n\nOne key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins; instead, money is closely linked to bank accounts. Indeed, the macroeconomic policies concerning money are largely conducted through the **banking system**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. The next section explains how banks function and how a nation\u2019s banking system has the power to create money.\n\n\nRead a brief [article][1] on the current monetary challenges in Sweden.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nMoney is measured with several definitions: M1 includes currency and money in checking accounts (demand deposits). Traveler\u2019s checks are also a component of M1, but are declining in use. M2 includes all of M1, plus savings deposits, time deposits like certificates of deposit, and money market funds.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIf you are out shopping for clothes and books, what is easiest and most convenient for you to spend: M1 or M2? Explain your answer.\n\n\n\nThe currency and checks in M1 are easiest to spend. It is harder to spend M2 directly, although if there is an automatic teller machine in the shopping mall, you can turn M2 from your savings account into an M1 of currency quite quickly. If your answer is about \u201ccredit cards,\u201d then you are really talking about spending M1\u2014although it is M1 from the account of the credit card company, which you will repay later when you credit card bill comes due.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the following list of items, indicate if they are in M1, M2, or neither:\n\n1.  Your $5,000 line of credit on your Bank of America card\n2.  $50 dollars\u2019 worth of traveler\u2019s checks you have not used yet\n3.  $1 in quarters in your pocket\n4.  $1200 in your checking account\n5.  $2000 you have in a money market account\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  Neither in M1 or M2\n2.  That is part of M1, and because M2 includes M1 it is also part of M2\n3.  Currency out in the public hands is part of M1 and M2\n4.  Checking deposits are in M1 and M2\n5.  Money market accounts are in M2\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat components of money are counted as part of M1?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat components of money are counted in M2?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nExplain why you think the Federal Reserve Bank tracks M1 and M2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total amount of U.S. currency in circulation divided by the U.S. population comes out to about $3,500 per person.

He answered: \u201cThat\u2019s where the money is.\u201d While this may have been true at one time, from the perspective of modern economists, Sutton is both right and wrong. He is wrong because the overwhelming majority of money in the economy is not in the form of currency sitting in vaults or drawers at banks, waiting for a robber to appear. Most money is in the form of bank accounts, which exist only as electronic records on computers. From a broader perspective, however, the bank robber was more right than he may have known. Banking is intimately interconnected with money and consequently, with the broader economy.\n\nBanks make it far easier for a complex economy to carry out the extraordinary range of transactions that occur in goods, labor, and financial capital markets. Imagine for a moment what the economy would be like if all payments had to be made in cash. When shopping for a large purchase or going on vacation you might need to carry hundreds of dollars in a pocket or purse. Even small businesses would need stockpiles of cash to pay workers and to purchase supplies. A bank allows people and businesses to store this money in either a checking account or savings account, for example, and then withdraw this money as needed through the use of a direct withdrawal, writing a check, or using a debit card.\n\nBanks are a critical intermediary in what is called the **payment system**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets. Also, those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual that is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date. Those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to find someone to lend them cash **Transaction costs**{: data-type=\"term\"} are the costs associated with finding a lender or a borrower for this money. Thus, banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries\u2014they bring savers and borrowers together. Along with making transactions much safer and easier, banks also play a key role in the creation of money.\n\n### Banks as Financial Intermediaries\n\nAn \u201cintermediary\u201d is one who stands between two other parties. Banks are a **financial intermediary**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014that is, an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank. Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds, but they will not be included in this discussion because they are not considered to be **depository institutions**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which are institutions that accept money *deposits* and then use these to make loans. All the funds deposited are mingled in one big pool, which is then loaned out. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_002) illustrates the position of banks as financial intermediaries, with deposits flowing into a bank and loans flowing out. Of course, when banks make loans to firms, the banks will try to funnel financial capital to healthy businesses that have good prospects for repaying the loans, not to firms that are suffering losses and may be unable to repay.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C27_002 data-title=\"Banks as Financial Intermediaries\"}\n\n\n\nHow are banks, savings and loans, and credit unions related?\n\nBanks have a couple of close cousins: savings institutions and credit unions. Banks, as explained, receive deposits from individuals and businesses and make loans with the money. Savings institutions are also sometimes called \u201csavings and loans\u201d or \u201cthrifts.\u201d They also take loans and make deposits. However, from the 1930s until the 1980s, federal law limited how much interest savings institutions were allowed to pay to depositors. They were also required to make most of their loans in the form of housing-related loans, either to homebuyers or to real-estate developers and builders.\n\nA **credit union**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is a nonprofit financial institution that its members own and run. Members of each credit union decide who is eligible to be a member. Usually, potential members would be everyone in a certain community, or groups of employees, or members of a certain organization. The credit union accepts deposits from members and focuses on making loans back to its members. While there are more credit unions than banks and more banks than savings and loans, the total assets of credit unions are growing.\n\nIn 2008, there were 7,085 banks. Due to the bank failures of 2007\u20132009 and bank mergers, there were 5,571 banks in the United States at the end of the fourth quarter in 2014. According to the Credit Union National Association, as of December 2014 there were 6,535 credit unions with assets totaling $1.1 billion. A day of \u201cTransfer Your Money\u201d took place in 2009 out of general public disgust with big bank bailouts. People were encouraged to transfer their deposits to credit unions. This has grown into the ongoing Move Your Money Project. Consequently, some now hold deposits as large as $50 billion. However, as of 2013, the 12 largest banks (0.2%) controlled 69 percent of all banking assets, according to the Dallas Federal Reserve.\n\n\n\n### A Bank\u2019s Balance Sheet\n\nA **balance sheet**{: data-type=\"term\"} is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities. An **asset**{: data-type=\"term\"} is something of value that is owned and can be used to produce something. For example, the cash you own can be used to pay your tuition. If you own a home, this is also considered an asset. A **liability**{: data-type=\"term\"} is a debt or something you owe. Many people borrow money to buy homes. In this case, a home is the asset, but the mortgage is the liability. The **net worth**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the asset value minus how much is owed (the liability). A bank\u2019s balance sheet operates in much the same way. A bank\u2019s net worth is also referred to as **bank capital**{: data-type=\"term\"}. A bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults, monies that the bank holds at the Federal Reserve bank (called \u201creserves\u201d), loans that are made to customers, and bonds.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_004) illustrates a hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank. Because of the two-column format of the balance sheet, with the T-shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under \u201cAssets\u201d and \u201cLiabilities,\u201d it is sometimes called a **T-account**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C27_004 data-title=\"A Balance Sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank \"}\n\nThe \u201cT\u201d in a T-account separates the assets of a firm, on the left, from its liabilities, on the right. All firms use T-accounts, though most are much more complex. For a bank, the assets are the financial instruments that either the bank is holding (its reserves) or those instruments where other parties owe money to the bank\u2014like loans made by the bank and U.S. Government Securities, such as U.S. treasury bonds purchased by the bank. Liabilities are what the bank owes to others. Specifically, the bank owes any deposits made in the bank to those who have made them. The net worth of the bank is the total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth is included on the liabilities side to have the T account balance to zero. For a healthy business, net worth will be positive. For a bankrupt firm, net worth will be negative. In either case, on a bank\u2019s T-account, assets will always equal liabilities plus net worth.\n\nWhen bank customers deposit money into a checking account, savings account, or a certificate of deposit, the bank views these deposits as liabilities. After all, the bank owes these deposits to its customers, when the customers wish to withdraw their money. In the example shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_004), the Safe and Secure Bank holds $10 million in deposits.\n\nLoans are the first category of bank assets shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_004). Say that a family takes out a 30-year mortgage loan to purchase a house, which means that the borrower will repay the loan over the next 30 years. This loan is clearly an asset from the bank\u2019s perspective, because the borrower has a legal obligation to make payments to the bank over time. But in practical terms, how can the value of the mortgage loan that is being paid over 30 years be measured in the present? One way of measuring the value of something\u2014whether a loan or anything else\u2014is by estimating what another party in the market is willing to pay for it. Many banks issue home loans, and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so, but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments. The market where loans are made to borrowers is called the primary **loan market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, while the market in which these loans are bought and sold by financial institutions is the secondary loan market.\n\nOne key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan, when they buy it in the secondary loan market, is the perceived riskiness of the loan: that is, given the characteristics of the borrower, such as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly, what proportion of loans of this type will be repaid? The greater the risk that a loan will not be repaid, the less that any financial institution will pay to acquire the loan. Another key factor is to compare the interest rate charged on the original loan with the current interest rate in the economy. If the original loan made at some point in the past requires the borrower to pay a low interest rate, but current interest rates are relatively high, then a financial institution will pay less to acquire the loan. In contrast, if the original loan requires the borrower to pay a high interest rate, while current interest rates are relatively low, then a financial institution will pay more to acquire the loan. For the Safe and Secure Bank in this example, the total value of its loans if they were sold to other financial institutions in the secondary market is $5 million.\n\nThe second category of bank asset is **bonds**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which are a common mechanism for borrowing, used by the federal and local government, and also private companies, and nonprofit organizations. A bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds\u2014typically bonds issued by the U.S. government. Government bonds are low-risk because the government is virtually certain to pay off the bond, albeit at a low rate of interest. These bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an asset: The bank will receive a stream of payments in the future. In our example, the Safe and Secure Bank holds bonds worth a total value of $4 million.\n\nThe final entry under assets is **reserves**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which is money that the bank keeps on hand, and that is not loaned out or invested in bonds\u2014and thus does not lead to interest payments. The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of depositors\u2019 money on \u201creserve,\u201d which means either in their vaults or kept at the Federal Reserve Bank. This is called a reserve requirement. ([Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation](/m48768){: .target-chapter} will explain how the level of these required reserves are one policy tool that governments have to influence bank behavior.) Additionally, banks may also want to keep a certain amount of reserves on hand in excess of what is required. The Safe and Secure Bank is holding $2 million in reserves.\n\nThe net worth of a bank is defined as its total assets minus its total liabilities. For the Safe and Secure Bank shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_004), net worth is equal to $1 million; that is, $11 million in assets minus $10 million in liabilities. For a financially healthy bank, the net worth will be positive. If a bank has negative net worth and depositors tried to withdraw their money, the bank would not be able to give all depositors their money.\n\n\nFor some concrete examples of what banks do, watch this [video][1] from Paul Solman\u2019s \u201cMaking Sense of Financial News.\u201d\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### How Banks Go Bankrupt\n\nA bank that is bankrupt will have a negative net worth, meaning its assets will be worth less than its liabilities. How can this happen? Again, looking at the balance sheet helps to explain.\n\nA well-run bank will assume that a small percentage of borrowers will not repay their loans on time, or at all, and factor these missing payments into its planning. Remember, the calculations of the expenses of banks every year includes a factor for loans that are not repaid, and the value of a bank\u2019s loans on its balance sheet assumes a certain level of riskiness because some loans will not be repaid. Even if a bank expects a certain number of loan defaults, it will suffer if the number of loan defaults is much greater than expected, as can happen during a recession. For example, if the Safe and Secure Bank in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_004) experienced a wave of unexpected defaults, so that its loans declined in value from $5 million to $3 million, then the assets of the Safe and Secure Bank would decline so that the bank had negative net worth.\n\n\n\nWhat led to the financial crisis of 2008\u20132009?\n\nMany banks make mortgage loans so that people can buy a home, but then do not keep the loans on their books as an asset. Instead, the bank sells the loan. These loans are \u201csecuritized,\u201d which means that they are bundled together into a financial security that is sold to investors. Investors in these mortgage-backed securities receive a rate of return based on the level of payments that people make on all the mortgages that stand behind the security.\n\n**Securitization**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} offers certain advantages. If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area, then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines, so that many people are unable to make their payments. But if a bank sells its local loans, and then buys a mortgage-backed security based on home loans in many parts of the country, it can avoid being exposed to local financial risks. (In the simple example in the text, banks just own \u201cbonds.\u201d In reality, banks can own a number of financial instruments, as long as these financial investments are safe enough to satisfy the government bank regulators.) From the standpoint of a local homebuyer, securitization offers the benefit that a local bank does not need to have lots of extra funds to make a loan, because the bank is only planning to hold that loan for a short time, before selling the loan so that it can be pooled into a financial security.\n\nBut securitization also offers one potentially large disadvantage. If a bank is going to hold a mortgage loan as an asset, the bank has an incentive to scrutinize the borrower carefully to ensure that the loan is likely to be repaid. However, a bank that is going to sell the loan may be less careful in making the loan in the first place. The bank will be more willing to make what are called \u201csubprime loans,\u201d which are loans that have characteristics like low or zero down-payment, little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income, and sometimes low payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments after that. Some **subprime loans**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} made in the mid-2000s were later dubbed NINJA loans: loans made even though the borrower had demonstrated No Income, No Job, or Assets.\n\nThese subprime loans were typically sold and turned into financial securities\u2014but with a twist. The idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage-backed securities, certain investors would agree to take the first, say, 5% of such losses. Other investors would agree to take, say, the next 5% of losses. By this approach, still other investors would not need to take any losses unless these mortgage-backed financial securities lost 25% or 30% or more of their total value. These complex securities, along with other economic factors, encouraged a large expansion of subprime loans in the mid-2000s.\n\nThe economic stage was now set for a banking crisis. Banks thought they were buying only ultra-safe securities, because even though the securities were ultimately backed by risky subprime mortgages, the banks only invested in the part of those securities where they were protected from small or moderate levels of losses. But as housing prices fell after 2007, and the deepening recession made it harder for many people to make their mortgage payments, many banks found that their mortgage-backed financial assets could end up being worth much less than they had expected\u2014and so the banks were staring bankruptcy in the face. In the 2008\u20132011 period, 318 banks failed in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank\u2019s liabilities, namely the deposits of its customers, can be withdrawn quickly, but many of the bank\u2019s assets like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades.This **asset-liability time mismatch**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014a bank\u2019s liabilities can be withdrawn in the short term while its assets are repaid in the long term\u2014can cause severe problems for a bank. For example, imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial amount of money at a certain interest rate, but then sees interest rates rise substantially. The bank can find itself in a precarious situation. If it does not raise the interest rate it pays to depositors, then deposits will flow to other institutions that offer the higher interest rates that are now prevailing. However, if the bank raises the interest rates that it pays to depositors, it may end up in a situation where it is paying a higher interest rate to depositors than it is collecting from those past loans that were made at lower interest rates. Clearly, the bank cannot survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers.\n\nHow can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an asset-liability time mismatch? One strategy is for a bank to **diversify**{: data-type=\"term\"} its loans, which means lending to a variety of customers. For example, suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market\u2014say, making a high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area. If that one area suffers an unexpected economic downturn, the bank will suffer large losses. However, if a bank loans both to consumers who are buying homes and cars and also to a wide range of firms in many industries and geographic areas, the bank is less exposed to risk. When a bank diversifies its loans, those categories of borrowers who have an unexpectedly large number of defaults will tend to be balanced out, according to random chance, by other borrowers who have an unexpectedly low number of defaults. Thus, diversification of loans can help banks to keep a positive net worth. However, if a widespread recession occurs that touches many industries and geographic areas, diversification will not help.\n\nAlong with diversifying their loans, banks have several other strategies to reduce the risk of an unexpectedly large number of loan defaults. For example, banks can sell some of the loans they make in the secondary loan market, as described earlier, and instead hold a greater share of assets in the form of government bonds or reserves. Nevertheless, in a lengthy recession, most banks will see their net worth decline because a higher share of loans will not be repaid in tough economic times.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nBanks facilitate the use of money for transactions in the economy because people and firms can use bank accounts when selling or buying goods and services, when paying a worker or being paid, and when saving money or receiving a loan. In the financial capital market, banks are financial intermediaries; that is, they operate between savers who supply financial capital and borrowers who demand loans. A balance sheet (sometimes called a T-account) is an accounting tool which lists assets in one column and liabilities in another column. The liabilities of a bank are its deposits. The assets of a bank include its loans, its ownership of bonds, and its reserves (which are not loaned out). The net worth of a bank is calculated by subtracting the bank\u2019s liabilities from its assets. Banks run a risk of negative net worth if the value of their assets declines. The value of assets can decline because of an unexpectedly high number of defaults on loans, or if interest rates rise and the bank suffers an asset-liability time mismatch in which the bank is receiving a low rate of interest on its long-term loans but must pay the currently higher market rate of interest to attract depositors. Banks can protect themselves against these risks by choosing to diversify their loans or to hold a greater proportion of their assets in bonds and reserves. If banks hold only a fraction of their deposits as reserves, then the process of banks\u2019 lending money, those loans being re-deposited in banks, and the banks making additional loans will create money in the economy.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nExplain why the money listed under assets on a bank balance sheet may not actually be in the bank?\n\n\n\nA bank\u2019s assets include cash held in their vaults, but assets also include monies that the bank holds at the Federal Reserve Bank (called \u201creserves\u201d), loans that are made to customers, and bonds.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhy is a bank called a financial intermediary?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does a balance sheet show?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the assets of a bank?

{"module_id": "m48767", "module_title": "Economics - m48767", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48767", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Utilize the money multiplier formulate to determine how banks create money\n* Analyze and create T-account balance sheets\n* Evaluate the risks and benefits of money and banks\n\n\n\nBanks and money are intertwined. It is not just that most money is in the form of bank accounts. The banking system can literally create money through the process of making loans. Let\u2019s see how.\n\n### Money Creation by a Single Bank\n\nStart with a hypothetical bank called Singleton Bank. The bank has $10 million in deposits. The T-account balance sheet for Singleton Bank, when it holds all of the deposits in its vaults, is shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_005). At this stage, Singleton Bank is simply storing money for depositors and is using these deposits to make loans. In this simplified example, Singleton Bank cannot earn any interest income from these loans and cannot pay its depositors an interest rate either.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C27_005 data-title=\"Singleton Bank&#x2019;s Balance Sheet: Receives $10 million in Deposits \"}\n\nSingleton Bank is required by the Federal Reserve to keep $1 million on reserve (10% of total deposits). It will loan out the remaining $9 million. By loaning out the $9 million and charging interest, it will be able to make interest payments to depositors and earn interest income for Singleton Bank (for now, we will keep it simple and not put interest income on the balance sheet). Instead of becoming just a storage place for deposits, Singleton Bank can become a financial intermediary between savers and borrowers.\n\nThis change in business plan alters Singleton Bank\u2019s balance sheet, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_006). Singleton\u2019s assets have changed; it now has $1 million in reserves and a loan to Hank\u2019s Auto Supply of $9 million. The bank still has $10 million in deposits.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C27_006 data-title=\"Singleton Bank&#x2019;s Balance Sheet: 10% Reserves, One Round of Loans \"}\n\nSingleton Bank lends $9 million to Hank\u2019s Auto Supply. The bank records this loan by making an entry on the balance sheet to indicate that a loan has been made. This loan is an asset, because it will generate interest income for the bank. Of course, the loan officer is not going to let Hank walk out of the bank with $9 million in cash. The bank issues Hank\u2019s Auto Supply a cashier\u2019s check for the $9 million. Hank deposits the loan in his regular checking account with First National. The deposits at First National rise by $9 million and its reserves also rise by $9 million, as [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_007) shows. First National must hold 10% of additional deposits as required reserves but is free to loan out the rest\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C27_007 data-title=\"First National Balance Sheet \"}\n\nMaking loans that are deposited into a demand deposit account increases the M1 money supply. Remember the definition of M1 includes checkable (demand) deposits, which can be easily used as a medium of exchange to buy goods and services. Notice that the money supply is now $19 million: $10 million in deposits in Singleton bank and $9 million in deposits at First National. Obviously these deposits will be drawn down as Hank\u2019s Auto Supply writes checks to pay its bills. But the bigger picture is that a bank must hold enough money in reserves to meet its liabilities; the rest the bank loans out. In this example so far, bank lending has expanded the money supply by $9 million.\n\nNow, First National must hold only 10% as required reserves ($900,000) but can lend out the other 90% ($8.1 million) in a loan to Jack\u2019s Chevy Dealership as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_008).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C27_008 data-title=\"First National Balance Sheet \"}\n\nIf Jack\u2019s deposits the loan in its checking account at Second National, the money supply just increased by an additional $8.1 million, as [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C27_009) shows.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C27_009 data-title=\"Second National Bank&#x2019;s Balance Sheet \"}\n\nHow is this money creation possible? It is possible because there are multiple banks in the financial system, they are required to hold only a fraction of their deposits, and loans end up deposited in other banks, which increases deposits and, in essence, the money supply.\n\n\nWatch this [video][1] to learn more about how banks create money.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### The Money Multiplier and a Multi-Bank System\n\nIn a system with multiple banks, the initial excess reserve amount that Singleton Bank decided to lend to Hank\u2019s Auto Supply was deposited into Frist National Bank, which is free to loan out $8.1 million. If all banks loan out their excess reserves, the money supply will expand. In a multi-bank system, the amount of money that the system can create is found by using the money multiplier. The money multiplier tells us by how many times a loan will be \u201cmultiplied\u201d as it is spent in the economy and then re-deposited in other banks.\n\nFortunately, a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system. The **money multiplier formula**{: data-type=\"term\"} is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mtext>Reserve\u00a0Requirement</mtext></mfrac></math>\n\n\nThe money multiplier is then multiplied by the change in excess reserves to determine the total amount of M1 money supply created in the banking system. See the Work it Out feature to walk through the multiplier calculation.\n\n\n\nUsing the Money Multiplier Formula\n\nUsing the money multiplier for the example in this text:\n\nStep 1. In the case of Singleton Bank, for whom the reserve requirement is 10% (or 0.10), the money multiplier is 1 divided by .10, which is equal to 10.\n\nStep 2. We have identified that the excess reserves are $9 million, so, using the formula we can determine the total change in the M1 money supply:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Total\u00a0Change\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0M1\u00a0Money\u00a0Supply</mtext></mtd><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mtext>Reserve\u00a0Requirement</mtext></mfrac><mo>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0</mo><mtext>Excess\u00a0Requirement</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mn>1</mn><mrow><mn>0.10</mn></mrow></mfrac><mo>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0</mo><mo>$9</mo><mtext>\u00a0million</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mn>10</mn><mo>\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0</mo><mo>$9</mo><mtext>\u00a0million</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mo>=</mo></mtd><mtd><mo>$90</mo><mtext>\u00a0million</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 3. Thus, we can say that, in this example, the total quantity of money generated in this economy after all rounds of lending are completed will be $90 million.\n\n\n\n### Cautions about the Money Multiplier\n\nThe money multiplier will depend on the proportion of reserves that banks are required to hold by the Federal Reserve Bank. Additionally, a bank can also choose to hold extra reserves. Banks may decide to vary how much they hold in reserves for two reasons: macroeconomic conditions and government rules. When an economy is in recession, banks are likely to hold a higher proportion of reserves because they fear that loans are less likely to be repaid when the economy is slow. The Federal Reserve may also raise or lower the required reserves held by banks as a policy move to affect the quantity of money in an economy, as [Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation](/m48768){: .target-chapter} will discuss.\n\nThe process of how banks create money shows how the quantity of money in an economy is closely linked to the quantity of lending or credit in the economy. Indeed, all of the money in the economy, except for the original reserves, is a result of bank loans that are re-deposited and loaned out, again, and again.\n\nFinally, the money multiplier depends on people re-depositing the money that they receive in the banking system. If people instead store their cash in safe-deposit boxes or in shoeboxes hidden in their closets, then banks cannot recirculate the money in the form of loans. Indeed, central banks have an incentive to assure that bank deposits are safe because if people worry that they may lose their bank deposits, they may start holding more money in cash, instead of depositing it in banks, and the quantity of loans in an economy will decline. Low-income countries have what economists sometimes refer to as \u201cmattress savings,\u201d or money that people are hiding in their homes because they do not trust banks. When mattress savings in an economy are substantial, banks cannot lend out those funds and the money multiplier cannot operate as effectively. The overall quantity of money and loans in such an economy will decline.\n\n\nWatch a [video][2] of Jem Bendell discussing \u201cThe Money Myth.\u201d\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Money and Banks\u2014Benefits and Dangers\n\nMoney and banks are marvelous social inventions that help a modern economy to function. Compared with the alternative of barter, money makes market exchanges vastly easier in goods, labor, and financial markets. Banking makes money still more effective in facilitating exchanges in goods and labor markets. Moreover, the process of banks making loans in financial capital markets is intimately tied to the creation of money.\n\nBut the extraordinary economic gains that are possible through money and banking also suggest some possible corresponding dangers. If banks are not working well, it sets off a decline in convenience and safety of transactions throughout the economy. If the banks are under financial stress, because of a widespread decline in the value of their assets, loans may become far less available, which can deal a crushing blow to sectors of the economy that depend on borrowed money like business investment, home construction, and car manufacturing. The Great Recession of 2008\u20132009 illustrated this pattern.\n\n\n\nThe Many Disguises of Money: From Cowries to Bit Coins\n\nThe global economy has come a long way since it started using cowrie shells as currency. We have moved away from commodity and commodity-backed paper money to fiat currency. As technology and global integration increases, the need for paper currency is diminishing, too. Every day, we witness the increased use of debit and credit cards.\n\nThe latest creation and perhaps one of the purest forms of fiat money is the Bitcoin. Bitcoins are a digital currency that allows users to buy goods and services online. Products and services such as videos and books may be purchased using Bitcoins. It is not backed by any commodity nor has it been decreed by any government as legal tender, yet it used as a medium of exchange and its value (online at least) can be stored. It is also unregulated by any central bank, but is created online through people solving very complicated mathematics problems and getting paid afterward. Bitcoin.org is an information source if you are curious. Bitcoins are a relatively new type of money. At present, because it is not sanctioned as a legal currency by any country nor regulated by any central bank, it lends itself for use in illegal trading activities as well as legal ones. As technology increases and the need to reduce transactions costs associated with using traditional forms of money increases, Bitcoins or some sort of digital currency may replace our dollar bill, just as the cowrie shell was replaced.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe money multiplier is defined as the quantity of money that the banking system can generate from each $1 of bank reserves. The formula for calculating the multiplier is 1/reserve ratio, where the reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that the bank wishes to hold as reserves. The quantity of money in an economy and the quantity of credit for loans are inextricably intertwined. Much of the money in an economy is created by the network of banks making loans, people making deposits, and banks making more loans.\n\nGiven the macroeconomic dangers of a malfunctioning banking system, [Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation](/m48768){: .target-chapter} will discuss government policies for controlling the money supply and for keeping the banking system safe.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nImagine that you are in the position of buying loans in the secondary market (that is, buying the right to collect the payments on loans made by banks) for a bank or other financial services company. Explain why you would be willing to pay more or less for a given loan if:\n\n1.  The borrower has been late on a number of loan payments\n2.  Interest rates in the economy as a whole have risen since the loan was made\n3.  The borrower is a firm that has just declared a high level of profits\n4.  Interest rates in the economy as a whole have fallen since the loan was made\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  A borrower who has been late on a number of loan payments looks perhaps less likely to repay the loan, or to repay it on time, and so you would want to pay less for that loan.\n2.  If interest rates generally have risen, then this loan made at a time of relatively lower interest rates looks less attractive, and you would pay less for it.\n3.  If the borrower is a firm with a record of high profits, then it is likely to be able to repay the loan, and you would be willing to pay more for the loan.\n4.  If interest rates in the economy have fallen, then the loan is worth more.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nHow do banks create money?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the formula for the money multiplier?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nShould banks have to hold 100% of their deposits?

Monetary policy works when the central bank reduces interest rates and makes credit more available. As a result, business investment and other types of spending increase, causing GDP and employment to grow.\n\nBut what if the interest rates banks pay are close to zero already? They cannot be made negative, can they? That would mean that lenders pay borrowers for the privilege of taking their money. Yet, this was the situation the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in at the end of the 2008\u20132009 recession. The federal funds rate, which is the interest rate for banks that the Federal Reserve targets with its monetary policy, was slightly above 5% in 2007. By 2009, it had fallen to 0.16%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s situation was further complicated because fiscal policy, the other major tool for managing the economy, was constrained by fears that the federal budget deficit and the public debt were already too high. What were the Federal Reserve\u2019s options? How could monetary policy be used to stimulate the economy? The answer, as we will see in this chapter, was to change the rules of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central Banks\n* Bank Regulation\n* How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy\n* Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes\n* Pitfalls for Monetary Policy\n\n\n\nMoney, loans, and banks are all tied together. Money is deposited in bank accounts, which is then loaned to businesses, individuals, and other banks. When the interlocking system of money, loans, and banks works well, economic transactions are made smoothly in goods and labor markets and savers are connected with borrowers. If the money and banking system does not operate smoothly, the economy can either fall into recession or suffer prolonged inflation.\n\nThe government of every country has public policies that support the system of money, loans, and banking. But these policies do not always work perfectly. This chapter discusses how monetary policy works and what may prevent it from working perfectly.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

The central bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation\u2019s banking system to protect bank depositors and insure the health of the bank\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nThe organization responsible for conducting **monetary policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and ensuring that a nation\u2019s financial system operates smoothly is called the **central bank**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Most nations have central banks or currency boards. Some prominent central banks around the world include the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England. In the United States, the central bank is called the Federal Reserve\u2014often abbreviated as just \u201cthe Fed.\u201d This section explains the organization of the U.S. **Federal Reserve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and identifies the major responsibilities of a central bank.\n\n### Structure/Organization of the Federal Reserve\n\nUnlike most central banks, the Federal Reserve is semi-decentralized, mixing government appointees with representation from private-sector banks. At the national level, it is run by a Board of Governors, consisting of seven members appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Appointments are for 14-year terms and they are arranged so that one term expires January 31 of every even-numbered year. The purpose of the long and staggered terms is to insulate the Board of Governors as much as possible from political pressure so that policy decisions can be made based only on their economic merits. Additionally, except when filling an unfinished term, each member only serves one term, further insulating decision-making from politics. Policy decisions of the Fed do not require congressional approval, and the President cannot ask for the resignation of a Federal Reserve Governor as the President can with cabinet positions.\n\nOne member of the Board of Governors is designated as the Chair. For example, from 1987 until early 2006, the Chair was Alan Greenspan. From 2006 until 2014, Ben Bernanke held the post. The current Chair, Janet Yellen, has made many headlines already. Why? See the following Clear It Up feature to find out.\n\n\n\nWho has the most immediate economic power in the world?\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C28_012 data-title=\"Chair of the Federal Reserve Board \"}\n\n\nWhat individual can make financial market crash or soar just by making a public statement? It is not Bill Gates or Warren Buffett. It is not even the President of the United States. The answer is the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. In early 2014, **Janet L. Yellen**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_012) became the first woman to hold this post. Yellen has been described in the media as \u201cperhaps the most qualified Fed chair in history.\u201d With a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University, Yellen has taught macroeconomics at Harvard, the London School of Economics, and most recently at the University of California at Berkeley. From 2004\u20132010, Yellen was President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Not an ivory tower economist, Yellen became one of the few economists who warned about a possible bubble in the housing market, more than two years before the financial crisis occurred. Yellen served on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve twice, most recently as Vice Chair. She also spent two years as Chair of the President\u2019s Council of Economic Advisors. If experience and credentials mean anything, Yellen is likely to be an effective Fed chair.\n\n\n\nThe Fed Chair is first among equals on the Board of Governors. While he or she has only one vote, the Chair controls the agenda, and is the public voice of the Fed, so he or she has more power and influence than one might expect.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to see who the current members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors are. You can follow the links provided for each board member to learn more about their backgrounds, experiences, and when their terms on the board will end.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve is more than the Board of Governors. The Fed also includes 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, each of which is responsible for supporting the commercial banks and economy generally in its district. The Federal Reserve districts and the cities where their regional headquarters are located are shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_001). The commercial banks in each district elect a Board of Directors for each regional Federal Reserve bank, and that board chooses a president for each regional Federal Reserve district. Thus, the Federal Reserve System includes both federally and private-sector appointed leaders.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C28_001 data-title=\"The Twelve Federal Reserve Districts \"}\n\n### What Does a Central Bank Do?\n\nThe Federal Reserve, like most central banks, is designed to perform three important functions:\n\n1.  To conduct monetary policy\n2.  To promote stability of the financial system\n3.  To provide banking services to commercial banks and other depository institutions, and to provide banking services to the federal government.\n{: type=\"1\"}\n\nThe first two functions are sufficiently important that we will discuss them in their own modules; the third function we will discuss here.\n\nThe Federal Reserve provides many of the same services to banks as banks provide to their customers. For example, all commercial banks have an account at the Fed where they deposit reserves. Similarly, banks can obtain loans from the Fed through the \u201cdiscount window\u201d facility, which will be discussed in more detail later. The Fed is also responsible for check processing. When you write a check, for example, to buy groceries, the grocery store deposits the check in its bank account. Then, the physical check (or an image of that actual check) is returned to your bank, after which funds are transferred from your bank account to the account of the grocery store. The Fed is responsible for each of these actions.\n\nOn a more mundane level, the Federal Reserve ensures that enough currency and coins are circulating through the financial system to meet public demands. For example, each year the Fed increases the amount of currency available in banks around the Christmas shopping season and reduces it again in January.\n\nFinally, the Fed is responsible for assuring that banks are in compliance with a wide variety of consumer protection laws. For example, banks are forbidden from discriminating on the basis of age, race, sex, or marital status. Banks are also required to disclose publicly information about the loans they make for buying houses and how those loans are distributed geographically, as well as by sex and race of the loan applicants.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe most prominent task of a central bank is to conduct monetary policy, which involves changes to interest rates and credit conditions, affecting the amount of borrowing and spending in an economy. Some prominent central banks around the world include the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England.\n\n### Self-Check Question\n\n\n\nWhy is it important for the members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to have longer terms in office than elected officials, like the President?\n\n\n\nLonger terms insulate the Board from political forces. Since the presidency can potentially change every four years, the Federal Reserve\u2019s independence prevents drastic swings in monetary policy with every new administration and allows policy decisions to be made only on economic grounds.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nHow is a central bank different from a typical commercial bank?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList the three traditional tools that a central bank has for controlling the money supply.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhy do presidents typically reappoint Chairs of the Federal Reserve Board even when they were originally appointed by a president of a different political party?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn what ways might monetary policy be superior to fiscal policy? In what ways might it be inferior?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nMatthews, Dylan. \u201cNine amazing facts about Janet Yellen, our next Fed chair.\u201d Wonkblog. *The Washington Post*.

The goal is not only to protect individuals\u2019 savings, but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself. This esoteric task is usually behind the scenes, but came into view during the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis, when for a brief period of time, critical parts of the financial system failed and firms became unable to obtain financing for ordinary parts of their business. Imagine if suddenly you were unable to access the money in your bank accounts because your checks were not accepted for payment and your debit cards were declined. This gives an idea of what a failure of the payments/financial system is like.\n\n**Bank regulation**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is intended to maintain the solvency of banks by avoiding excessive risk. Regulation falls into a number of categories, including reserve requirements, capital requirements, and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make. In [Money and Banking](/m48761){: .target-chapter}, we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum percentage of their deposits on hand as **reserves**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. \u201cOn hand\u201d is a bit of a misnomer because, while a portion of bank reserves are held as cash in the bank, the majority are held in the bank\u2019s account at the Federal Reserve, and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors. Another part of bank regulation is restrictions on the types of investments banks are allowed to make. Banks are allowed to make loans to businesses, individuals, and other banks. They are allowed to purchase U.S. Treasury securities but, to protect depositors, they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky.\n\n**Bank capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is the difference between a bank\u2019s assets and its liabilities. In other words, it is a bank\u2019s **net worth**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. A bank must have positive net worth; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt, meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities. Regulation requires that banks maintain a minimum net worth, usually expressed as a percent of their assets, to protect their depositors and other creditors.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read the brief article, \u201cStop Confusing Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation.\u201d\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Bank Supervision\n\nSeveral government agencies monitor the balance sheets of banks to make sure they have positive net worth and are not taking too high a level of risk. Within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has a national staff of bank examiners who conduct on-site reviews of the 1,500 or so of the largest national banks. The bank examiners also review any foreign banks that have branches in the United States. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also monitors and regulates about 800 savings and loan institutions.\n\nThe **National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} supervises credit unions, which are nonprofit banks owned and run by their members. There are over 6,000 credit unions in the U.S. economy, though the typical credit union is small compared to most banks.\n\nThe Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions. For example, conglomerate firms that own banks and other businesses are called \u201cbank holding companies.\u201d While other regulators like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises the banks, the Federal Reserve supervises the holding companies.\n\nWhen the supervision of banks (and bank-like institutions such as savings and loans and credit unions) works well, most banks will remain financially healthy most of the time. If the bank supervisors find that a bank has low or negative net worth, or is making too high a proportion of risky loans, they can require that the bank change its behavior\u2014or, in extreme cases, even force the bank to be closed or sold to a financially healthy bank.\n\nBank supervision can run into both practical and political questions. The practical question is that measuring the value of a bank\u2019s assets is not always straightforward. As discussed in [Money and Banking](/m48761){: .target-chapter}, a bank\u2019s **assets**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} are its loans, and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that these loans will not be repaid. These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries, or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan.\n\nThe political question arises because the decision by a bank supervisor to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial, and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the owners of the bank and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off.\n\nFor example, many observers have pointed out that Japan\u2019s banks were in deep financial trouble through most of the 1990s; however, nothing substantial had been done about it by the early 2000s. A similar unwillingness to confront problems with struggling banks is visible across the rest of the world, in East Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia, and elsewhere.\n\nIn the United States, laws were passed in the 1990s requiring that bank supervisors make their findings open and public, and that they act as soon as a problem is identified. However, as many U.S. banks were staggered by the recession of 2008\u20132009, critics of the bank regulators asked pointed questions about why the regulators had not foreseen the financial shakiness of the banks earlier, before such large losses had a chance to accumulate.\n\n### Bank Runs\n\nBack in the nineteenth century and during the first few decades of the twentieth century (around and during the Great Depression), putting your money in a bank could be nerve-wracking. Imagine that the net worth of your bank became negative, so that the bank\u2019s assets were not enough to cover its liabilities. In this situation, whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money, and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough, lost their money. Depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_013) is called a **bank run**{: data-type=\"term\"}. In the movie *It\u2019s a Wonderful Life*, the bank manager, played by Jimmy Stewart, faces a mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money, but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits\u2014using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C28_013 data-title=\"A Run on the Bank \"}\n\nThe risk of bank runs created instability in the banking system. Even a rumor that a bank might experience negative net worth could trigger a bank run and, in a bank run, even healthy banks could be destroyed. Because a bank loans out most of the money it receives, and because it keeps only limited reserves on hand, a bank run of any size would quickly drain any of the bank\u2019s available cash. When the bank had no cash remaining, it only intensified the fears of remaining depositors that they could lose their money. Moreover, a bank run at one bank often triggered a chain reaction of runs on other banks. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, bank runs were typically not the original cause of a recession\u2014but they could make a recession much worse.\n\n### Deposit Insurance\n\nTo protect against bank runs, Congress has put two strategies into place: **deposit insurance**{: data-type=\"term\"} and the lender of last resort. Deposit insurance is an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their money, even if the bank goes bankrupt. About 70 countries around the world, including all of the major economies, have deposit insurance programs. In the United States, the **Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is responsible for deposit insurance. Banks pay an insurance premium to the FDIC. The insurance premium is based on the bank\u2019s level of deposits, and then adjusted according to the riskiness of a bank\u2019s financial situation. In 2009, for example, a fairly safe bank with a high net worth might have paid 10\u201320 cents in insurance premiums for every $100 in bank deposits, while a risky bank with very low net worth might have paid 50\u201360 cents for every $100 in bank deposits.\n\nBank examiners from the FDIC evaluate the balance sheets of banks, looking at the value of assets and liabilities, to determine the level of riskiness. The FDIC provides deposit insurance for about 6,509 banks (as of the end of 2014). Even if a bank fails, the government guarantees that depositors will receive up to $250,000 of their money in each account, which is enough for almost all individuals, although not sufficient for many businesses. Since the United States enacted deposit insurance in the 1930s, no one has lost any of their insured deposits. Bank runs no longer happen at insured banks.\n\n### Lender of Last Resort\n\nThe problem with bank runs is not that insolvent banks will fail; they are, after all, bankrupt and need to be shut down. The problem is that bank runs can cause solvent banks to fail and spread to the rest of the financial system. To prevent this, the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they cannot obtain funds from anywhere else. This is known as the **lender of last resort**{: data-type=\"term\"} role. For banks, the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money.\n\nThe lender of last resort task can come up in other financial crises, as well. During the panic of the stock market crash in 1987, when the value of U.S. stocks fell by 25% in a single day, the Federal Reserve made a number of short-term emergency loans so that the financial system could keep functioning. During the recession of 2008\u20132009, the \u201cquantitative easing\u201d policies (discussed below) of the Federal Reserve can be interpreted as a willingness to make short-term credit available as needed in a time when the banking and financial system was under stress.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA bank run occurs when there are rumors (possibly true, possibly false) that a bank is at financial risk of having negative net worth. As a result, depositors rush to the bank to withdraw their money and put it someplace safer. Even false rumors, if they cause a bank run, can force a healthy bank to lose its deposits and be forced to close. Deposit insurance guarantees bank depositors that, even if the bank has negative net worth, their deposits will be protected. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) collects deposit insurance premiums from banks and guarantees bank deposits up to $250,000. Bank supervision involves inspecting the balance sheets of banks to make sure that they have positive net worth and that their assets are not too risky. In the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is responsible for supervising banks and inspecting savings and loans and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for inspecting credit unions. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve also play a role in bank supervision.\n\nWhen a central bank acts as a lender of last resort, it makes short-term loans available in situations of severe financial panic or stress. The failure of a single bank can be treated like any other business failure. Yet if many banks fail, it can reduce aggregate demand in a way that can bring on or deepen a recession. The combination of deposit insurance, bank supervision, and lender of last resort policies help to prevent weaknesses in the banking system from causing recessions.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nGiven the danger of bank runs, why do banks not keep the majority of deposits on hand to meet the demands of depositors?\n\n\n\nBanks make their money from issuing loans and charging interest. The more money that is stored in the bank\u2019s vault, the less is available for lending and the less money the bank stands to make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBank runs are often described as \u201cself-fulfilling prophecies.\u201d Why is this phrase appropriate to bank runs?\n\n\n\nThe fear and uncertainty created by the suggestion that a bank might fail can lead depositors to withdraw their money. If many depositors do this at the same time, the bank may not be able to meet their demands and will, indeed, fail.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nHow is bank regulation linked to the conduct of monetary policy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a bank run?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a program of deposit insurance as it is operated in the United States, what is being insured and who pays the insurance premiums?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn government programs of bank supervision, what is being supervised?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the lender of last resort?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName and briefly describe the responsibilities of each of the following agencies: FDIC, NCUA, and OCC.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question\n\n\n\nThe term \u201cmoral hazard\u201d describes increases in risky behavior resulting from efforts to make that behavior safer. How does the concept of moral hazard apply to deposit insurance and other bank regulations?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \u201cOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency.\u201d Accessed November 2013. http://www.occ.gov/.\n\nNational Credit Union Administration. \u201cAbout NCUA.\u201d Accessed November 2013. http://www.ncua.gov/about/Pages/default.aspx.\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nbank run\n: when depositors race to the bank to withdraw their deposits for fear that otherwise they would be lost\n^\n\ndeposit insurance\n: an insurance system that makes sure depositors in a bank do not lose their money, even if the bank goes bankrupt\n^\n\nlender of last resort\n: an institution that provides short-term emergency loans in conditions of financial crisis\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bankregulation", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power \u201cto coin money\u201d and \u201cto regulate the value thereof.\u201d As part of the 1913 legislation that created the Federal Reserve, Congress delegated these powers to the Fed. Monetary policy involves managing interest rates and credit conditions, which influences the level of economic activity, as described in more detail below.\n\nA central bank has three traditional tools to implement monetary policy in the economy:\n\n* Open market operations\n* Changing reserve requirements\n* Changing the discount rate\n{: data-bullet-style=\"bullet\"}\n\nIn discussing how these three tools work, it is useful to think of the central bank as a \u201cbank for banks\u201d\u2014that is, each private-sector bank has its own account at the central bank. We will discuss each of these monetary policy tools in the sections below.\n\n### Open Market Operations\n\nThe most commonly used tool of monetary policy in the U.S. is **open market operations**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Open market operations take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates. The specific interest rate targeted in open market operations is the federal funds rate. The name is a bit of a misnomer since the federal funds rate is the interest rate charged by commercial banks making overnight loans to other banks. As such, it is a very short term interest rate, but one that reflects credit conditions in financial markets very well.\n\nThe **Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)**{: data-type=\"term\"} makes the decisions regarding these open market operations. The FOMC is made up of the seven members of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Board of Governors. It also includes five voting members who are drawn, on a rotating basis, from the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The New York district president is a permanent voting member of the FOMC and the other four spots are filled on a rotating, annual basis, from the other 11 districts. The FOMC typically meets every six weeks, but it can meet more frequently if necessary. The FOMC tries to act by consensus; however, the chairman of the Federal Reserve has traditionally played a very powerful role in defining and shaping that consensus. For the Federal Reserve, and for most central banks, open market operations have, over the last few decades, been the most commonly used tool of monetary policy.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] for the Federal Reserve to learn more about current monetary policy.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nTo understand how open market operations affect the money supply, consider the balance sheet of Happy Bank, displayed in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_014). [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_014) (a) shows that Happy Bank starts with $460 million in assets, divided among reserves, bonds and loans, and $400 million in liabilities in the form of deposits, with a net worth of $60 million. When the central bank purchases $20 million in bonds from Happy Bank, the bond holdings of Happy Bank fall by $20 million and the bank\u2019s reserves rise by $20 million, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_014) (b). However, Happy Bank only wants to hold $40 million in reserves (the quantity of reserves that it started with in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_014)) (a), so the bank decides to loan out the extra $20 million in reserves and its loans rise by $20 million, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_014) (c). The open market operation by the central bank causes Happy Bank to make loans instead of holding its assets in the form of government bonds, which expands the money supply. As the new loans are deposited in banks throughout the economy, these banks will, in turn, loan out some of the deposits they receive, triggering the money multiplier discussed in [Money and Banking](/m48761){: .target-chapter}.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C28_014}\n\nWhere did the Federal Reserve get the $20 million that it used to purchase the **bonds**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}? A central bank has the power to create money. In practical terms, the Federal Reserve would write a check to Happy Bank, so that Happy Bank can have that money credited to its bank account at the Federal Reserve. In truth, the Federal Reserve created the money to purchase the bonds out of thin air\u2014or with a few clicks on some computer keys.\n\nOpen market operations can also reduce the quantity of money and loans in an economy. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_015) (a) shows the balance sheet of Happy Bank before the central bank sells bonds in the open market. When Happy Bank purchases $30 million in bonds, Happy Bank sends $30 million of its reserves to the central bank, but now holds an additional $30 million in bonds, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_015) (b). However, Happy Bank wants to hold $40 million in reserves, as in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_015) (a), so it will adjust down the quantity of its loans by $30 million, to bring its reserves back to the desired level, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_015) (c). In practical terms, a bank can easily reduce its quantity of loans. At any given time, a bank is receiving payments on loans that it made previously and also making new loans. If the bank just slows down or briefly halts making new loans, and instead adds those funds to its reserves, then its overall quantity of loans will decrease. A decrease in the quantity of loans also means fewer deposits in other banks, and other banks reducing their lending as well, as the money multiplier discussed in [Money and Banking](/m48761){: .target-chapter} takes effect. And what about all those bonds? How do they affect the money supply? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C28_015 data-title=\"\"}\n\n\n\nDoes selling or buying bonds increase the money supply?\n\nIs it a sale of bonds by the central bank which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates or is it a purchase of bonds by the central bank? The easy way to keep track of this is to treat the central bank as being *outside* the banking system. When a central bank buys bonds, money is flowing from the central bank to individual banks in the economy, increasing the supply of money in circulation. When a central bank sells bonds, then money from individual banks in the economy is flowing into the central bank\u2014reducing the quantity of money in the economy.\n\n\n\n### Changing Reserve Requirements\n\nA second method of conducting monetary policy is for the central bank to raise or lower the **reserve requirement**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which, as we noted earlier, is the percentage of each bank\u2019s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank. If banks are required to hold a greater amount in **reserves**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, they have less money available to lend out. If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves, they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out.\n\nIn early 2015, the Federal Reserve required banks to hold reserves equal to 0% of the first $14.5 million in deposits, then to hold reserves equal to 3% of the deposits up to $103.6 million, and 10% of any amount above $103.6 million. Small changes in the reserve requirements are made almost every year. For example, the $103.6 million dividing line is sometimes bumped up or down by a few million dollars. In practice, large changes in reserve requirements are rarely used to execute monetary policy. A sudden demand that all banks increase their reserves would be extremely disruptive and difficult to comply with, while loosening requirements too much would create a danger of banks being unable to meet the demand for withdrawals.\n\n### Changing the Discount Rate\n\nThe Federal Reserve was founded in the aftermath of the Financial Panic of 1907 when many banks failed as a result of bank runs. As mentioned earlier, since banks make profits by lending out their deposits, no bank, even those that are not bankrupt, can withstand a bank run. As a result of the Panic, the Federal Reserve was founded to be the \u201clender of last resort.\u201d In the event of a bank run, sound banks, (banks that were not bankrupt) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed\u2019s discount \u201cwindow\u201d to quell the bank run. The interest rate banks pay for such loans is called the **discount rate**{: data-type=\"term\"}. (They are so named because loans are made against the bank\u2019s outstanding loans \u201cat a discount\u201d of their face value.) Once depositors became convinced that the bank would be able to honor their withdrawals, they no longer had a reason to make a run on the bank. In short, the Federal Reserve was originally intended to provide credit passively, but in the years since its founding, the Fed has taken on a more active role with monetary policy.\n\nSo, the third traditional method for conducting monetary policy is to raise or lower the discount rate. If the central bank raises the discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their borrowing of reserves from the Fed, and instead call in loans to replace those reserves. Since fewer loans are available, the money supply falls and market interest rates rise. If the central bank lowers the discount rate it charges to banks, the process works in reverse.\n\nIn recent decades, the Federal Reserve has made relatively few discount loans. Before a bank borrows from the Federal Reserve to fill out its required reserves, the bank is expected to first borrow from other available sources, like other banks. This is encouraged by Fed\u2019s charging a higher discount rate, than the federal funds rate. Given that most banks borrow little at the discount rate, changing the discount rate up or down has little impact on their behavior. More importantly, the Fed has found from experience that open market operations are a more precise and powerful means of executing any desired monetary policy.\n\nIn the Federal Reserve Act, the phrase \u201c...to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper\u201d is contained in its long title. This tool was seen as the main tool for monetary policy when the Fed was initially created. This illustrates how monetary policy has evolved and how it continues to do so.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA central bank has three traditional tools to conduct monetary policy: open market operations, which involves buying and selling government bonds with banks; reserve requirements, which determine what level of reserves a bank is legally required to hold; and discount rates, which is the interest rate charged by the central bank on the loans that it gives to other commercial banks. The most commonly used tool is open market operations.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIf the central bank sells $500 in bonds to a bank that has issued $10,000 in loans and is exactly meeting the reserve requirement of 10%, what will happen to the amount of loans and to the money supply in general?\n\n\n\nThe bank has to hold $1,000 in reserves, so when it buys the $500 in bonds, it will have to reduce its loans by $500 to make up the difference. The money supply decreases by the same amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would be the effect of increasing the reserve requirements of banks on the money supply?\n\n\n\nAn increase in reserve requirements would reduce the supply of money, since more money would be held in banks rather than circulating in the economy.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nExplain how to use an open market operation to expand the money supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain how to use the reserve requirement to expand the money supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain how to use the discount rate to expand the money supply.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question\n\n\n\nExplain what would happen if banks were notified they had to increase their required reserves by one percentage point from, say, 9% to10% of deposits. What would their options be to come up with the cash?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nSuppose the Fed conducts an open market purchase by buying $10 million in Treasury bonds from Acme Bank. Sketch out the balance sheet changes that will occur as Acme converts the bond sale proceeds to new loans. The initial Acme bank balance sheet contains the following information: Assets \u2013 reserves 30, bonds 50, and loans 50; Liabilities \u2013 deposits 300 and equity 30.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose the Fed conducts an open market sale by selling $10 million in Treasury bonds to Acme Bank.

Conversely, a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a **contractionary monetary policy**{: data-type=\"term\"} or **tight monetary policy**{: data-type=\"term\"}. This module will discuss how expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand, and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation. We will conclude with a look at the Fed\u2019s monetary policy practice in recent decades.\n\n### The Effect of Monetary Policy on Interest Rates\n\nConsider the market for loanable bank funds, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_002). The original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) occurs at an interest rate of 8% and a quantity of funds loaned and borrowed of $10 billion. An expansionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S<sub>0</sub>) to S<sub>1</sub>, leading to an equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) with a lower interest rate of 6% and a quantity of funds loaned of $14 billion. Conversely, a contractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S<sub>0</sub>) to S<sub>2</sub>, leading to an equilibrium (E<sub>2</sub>) with a higher interest rate of 10% and a quantity of funds loaned of $8 billion.\n\n  to the new supply curve (S1) and to a new equilibrium of E1, reducing the interest rate from 8% to 6%. A contractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S0) to the new supply (S2), and raise the interest rate from 8% to 10%.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C28_002 data-title=\"Monetary Policy and Interest Rates \"}\n\nSo how does a central bank \u201craise\u201d interest rates? When describing the monetary policy actions taken by a central bank, it is common to hear that the central bank \u201craised interest rates\u201d or \u201clowered interest rates.\u201d We need to be clear about this: more precisely, through open market operations the central bank changes bank reserves in a way which affects the supply curve of loanable funds. As a result, interest rates change, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_002). If they do not meet the Fed\u2019s target, the Fed can supply more or less reserves until interest rates do.\n\nRecall that the specific interest rate the Fed targets is the **federal funds rate**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The Federal Reserve has, since 1995, established its target federal funds rate in advance of any open market operations.\n\nOf course, financial markets display a wide range of **interest rates**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that are to be repaid over different periods of time. In general, when the federal funds rate drops substantially, other interest rates drop, too, and when the federal funds rate rises, other interest rates rise. However, a fall or rise of one percentage point in the federal funds rate\u2014which remember is for borrowing overnight\u2014will typically have an effect of less than one percentage point on a 30-year loan to purchase a house or a three-year loan to purchase a car. Monetary policy can push the entire spectrum of interest rates higher or lower, but the specific interest rates are set by the forces of supply and demand in those specific markets for lending and borrowing.\n\n### The Effect of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand\n\nMonetary policy affects interest rates and the available quantity of loanable funds, which in turn affects several components of aggregate demand. Tight or contractionary monetary policy that leads to higher interest rates and a reduced quantity of loanable funds will reduce two components of aggregate demand. Business investment will decline because it is less attractive for firms to borrow money, and even firms that have money will notice that, with higher interest rates, it is relatively more attractive to put those funds in a financial investment than to make an investment in physical capital. In addition, higher interest rates will discourage consumer borrowing for big-ticket items like houses and cars. Conversely, loose or expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates and a higher quantity of loanable funds will tend to increase business investment and consumer borrowing for big-ticket items.\n\nIf the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment, with output below **potential GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econv1-2_C28_08) (a) illustrates this situation. This example uses a short-run upward-sloping **Keynesian aggregate supply curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (SRAS). The original equilibrium during a recession of E<sub>0</sub> occurs at an output level of 600. An expansionary monetary policy will reduce interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption spending, causing the original aggregate demand curve (AD<sub>0</sub>) to shift right to AD<sub>1</sub>, so that the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.\n\n The economy is originally in a recession with the equilibrium output and price level shown at E0. Expansionary monetary policy will reduce interest rates and shift aggregate demand to the right from AD0 to AD1, leading to the new equilibrium (E1) at the potential GDP level of output with a relatively small rise in the price level. (b) The economy is originally producing above the potential GDP level of output at the equilibrium E0 and is experiencing pressures for an inflationary rise in the price level. Contractionary monetary policy will shift aggregate demand to the left from AD0 to AD1, thus leading to a new equilibrium (E1) at the potential GDP level of output.\"){: #CNX_Econv1-2_C28_08 data-title=\"Expansionary or Contractionary Monetary Policy \"}\n\nConversely, if an economy is producing at a quantity of output above its potential GDP, a contractionary monetary policy can reduce the inflationary pressures for a rising price level. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econv1-2_C28_08) (b), the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) occurs at an output of 750, which is above potential GDP. A contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates, discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending, and cause the original demand curve (AD<sub>0</sub>) to shift left to AD<sub>1</sub>, so that the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.\n\nThese examples suggest that monetary policy should be **countercyclical**{: data-type=\"term\"}; that is, it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings. Monetary policy should be loosened when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tightened when inflation threatens. Of course, countercyclical policy does pose a danger of overreaction. If loose monetary policy seeking to end a recession goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the right that it triggers inflation. If tight monetary policy seeking to reduce inflation goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the left that a recession begins. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_011) (a) summarizes the chain of effects that connect loose and tight monetary policy to changes in output and the price level.\n\n  In expansionary monetary policy the central bank causes the supply of money and loanable funds to increase, which lowers the interest rate, stimulating additional borrowing for investment and consumption, and shifting aggregate demand right. The result is a higher price level and, at least in the short run, higher real GDP. (b) In contractionary monetary policy, the central bank causes the supply of money and credit in the economy to decrease, which raises the interest rate, discouraging borrowing for investment and consumption, and shifting aggregate demand left. The result is a lower price level and, at least in the short run, lower real GDP.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C28_011 data-title=\"The Pathways of Monetary Policy \"}\n\n### Federal Reserve Actions Over Last Four Decades\n\nFor the period from the mid-1970s up through the end of 2007, Federal Reserve monetary policy can largely be summed up by looking at how it targeted the federal funds interest rate using open market operations.\n\nOf course, telling the story of the U.S. economy since 1975 in terms of Federal Reserve actions leaves out many other macroeconomic factors that were influencing unemployment, recession, economic growth, and inflation over this time. The nine episodes of Federal Reserve action outlined in the sections below also demonstrate that the central bank should be considered one of the leading actors influencing the macro economy. As noted earlier, the single person with the greatest power to influence the U.S. economy is probably the chairperson of the Federal Reserve.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econv1-2_C28_10) shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades. The graph shows the federal funds interest rate (remember, this interest rate is set through open market operations), the **unemployment rate**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, and the **inflation rate**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} since 1975. Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure.\n\n {: #CNX_Econv1-2_C28_10 data-title=\"Monetary Policy, Unemployment, and Inflation \"}\n\n**Episode 1**\n\nConsider Episode 1 in the late 1970s. The rate of inflation was very high, exceeding 10% in 1979 and 1980, so the Federal Reserve used tight monetary policy to raise interest rates, with the federal funds rate rising from 5.5% in 1977 to 16.4% in 1981. By 1983, inflation was down to 3.2%, but aggregate demand contracted sharply enough that back-to-back recessions occurred in 1980 and in 1981\u20131982, and the unemployment rate rose from 5.8% in 1979 to 9.7% in 1982.\n\n**Episode 2**\n\nIn Episode 2, when the Federal Reserve was persuaded in the early 1980s that inflation was declining, the Fed began slashing interest rates to reduce unemployment. The federal funds interest rate fell from 16.4% in 1981 to 6.8% in 1986. By 1986 or so, inflation had fallen to about 2% and the unemployment rate had come down to 7%, and was still falling.\n\n**Episode 3**\n\nHowever, in Episode 3 in the late 1980s, inflation appeared to be creeping up again, rising from 2% in 1986 up toward 5% by 1989. In response, the Federal Reserve used contractionary monetary policy to raise the federal funds rates from 6.6% in 1987 to 9.2% in 1989. The tighter monetary policy stopped inflation, which fell from above 5% in 1990 to under 3% in 1992, but it also helped to cause the recession of 1990\u20131991, and the unemployment rate rose from 5.3% in 1989 to 7.5% by 1992.\n\n**Episode 4**\n\nIn Episode 4, in the early 1990s, when the Federal Reserve was confident that inflation was back under control, it reduced interest rates, with the federal funds interest rate falling from 8.1% in 1990 to 3.5% in 1992. As the economy expanded, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5% in 1992 to less than 5% by 1997.\n\n**Episodes 5 and 6**\n\nIn Episodes 5 and 6, the Federal Reserve perceived a risk of inflation and raised the federal funds rate from 3% to 5.8% from 1993 to 1995. Inflation did not rise, and the period of economic growth during the 1990s continued. Then in 1999 and 2000, the Fed was concerned that inflation seemed to be creeping up so it raised the federal funds interest rate from 4.6% in December 1998 to 6.5% in June 2000. By early 2001, inflation was declining again, but a recession occurred in 2001. Between 2000 and 2002, the unemployment rate rose from 4.0% to 5.8%.\n\n**Episodes 7 and 8**\n\nIn Episodes 7 and 8, the Federal Reserve conducted a loose monetary policy and slashed the federal funds rate from 6.2% in 2000 to just 1.7% in 2002, and then again to 1% in 2003. They actually did this because of fear of Japan-style deflation; this persuaded them to lower the Fed funds further than they otherwise would have. The recession ended, but, unemployment rates were slow to decline in the early 2000s. Finally, in 2004, the unemployment rate declined and the Federal Reserve began to raise the federal funds rate until it reached 5% by 2007.\n\n**Episode 9**\n\nIn Episode 9, as the Great Recession took hold in 2008, the Federal Reserve was quick to slash interest rates, taking them down to 2% in 2008 and to nearly 0% in 2009. When the Fed had taken interest rates down to near-zero by December 2008, the economy was still deep in recession. Open market operations could not make the interest rate turn negative. The Federal Reserve had to think \u201coutside the box.\u201d\n\n### Quantitative Easing\n\nThe most powerful and commonly used of the three traditional tools of monetary policy\u2014open market operations\u2014works by expanding or contracting the money supply in a way that influences the interest rate. In late 2008, as the U.S. economy struggled with recession, the Federal Reserve had already reduced the interest rate to near-zero. With the recession still ongoing, the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as **quantitative easing (QE)**{: data-type=\"term\"}. This is the purchase of long-term government and private mortgage-backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate **aggregate demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\nQuantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways. First, it involved the Fed purchasing long term **Treasury bonds**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, rather than short term **Treasury bills**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. In 2008, however, it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get. (Read the closing Bring it Home feature for more on this.) Therefore, Bernanke sought to lower long-term rates utilizing quantitative easing.\n\nThis leads to a second way QE is different from traditional monetary policy. Instead of purchasing Treasury securities, the Fed also began purchasing private mortgage-backed securities, something it had never done before. During the financial crisis, which precipitated the recession, mortgage-backed securities were termed \u201ctoxic assets,\u201d because when the housing market collapsed, no one knew what these securities were worth, which put the financial institutions which were holding those securities on very shaky ground. By offering to purchase mortgage-backed securities, the Fed was both pushing long term interest rates down and also removing possibly \u201ctoxic assets\u201d from the balance sheets of private financial firms, which would strengthen the financial system.\n\nQuantitative easing (QE) occurred in three episodes:\n\n1.  During QE<sub>1</sub>, which began in November 2008, the Fed purchased $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities from government enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n2.  In November 2010, the Fed began QE<sub>2</sub>, in which it purchased $600 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds.\n3.  QE<sub>3</sub>, began in September 2012 when the Fed commenced purchasing $40 billion of additional mortgage-backed securities per month. This amount was increased in December 2012 to $85 billion per month. The Fed stated that, when economic conditions permit, it will begin tapering (or reducing the monthly purchases). By October 2014, the Fed had announced the final $15 billion purchase of bonds, ending Quantitative Easing.\n{: type=\"1\"}\n\nThe quantitative easing policies adopted by the Federal Reserve (and by other central banks around the world) are usually thought of as temporary emergency measures. If these steps are, indeed, to be temporary, then the Federal Reserve will need to stop making these additional loans and sell off the financial securities it has accumulated. The concern is that the process of quantitative easing may prove more difficult to reverse than it was to enact. The evidence suggests that QE<sub>1</sub> was somewhat successful, but that QE<sub>2</sub> and QE<sub>3</sub> have been less so.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nAn expansionary (or loose) monetary policy raises the quantity of money and credit above what it otherwise would have been and reduces interest rates, boosting aggregate demand, and thus countering recession. A contractionary monetary policy, also called a tight monetary policy, reduces the quantity of money and credit below what it otherwise would have been and raises interest rates, seeking to hold down inflation. During the 2008\u20132009 recession, central banks around the world also used quantitative easing to expand the supply of credit.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhy does contractionary monetary policy cause interest rates to rise?\n\n\n\nContractionary policy reduces the amount of loanable funds in the economy. As with all goods, greater scarcity leads a greater price, so the interest rate, or the price of borrowing money, rises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does expansionary monetary policy causes interest rates to drop?\n\n\n\nAn increase in the amount of available loanable funds means that there are more people who want to lend.

Monetary policy affects the economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length. Remember, monetary policy involves a chain of events: the **central bank**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} must perceive a situation in the economy, hold a meeting, and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy. The change in monetary policy must percolate through the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates. When interest rates change, businesses must change their investment levels and consumers must change their borrowing patterns when purchasing homes or cars. Then it takes time for these changes to filter through the rest of the economy.\n\nAs a result of this chain of events, monetary policy has little effect in the immediate future; instead, its primary effects are felt perhaps one to three years in the future. The reality of long and variable time lags does not mean that a central bank should refuse to make decisions. It does mean that central banks should be humble about taking action, because of the risk that their actions can create as much or more economic instability as they resolve.\n\n### Excess Reserves\n\nBanks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves, but no rule prohibits them from holding additional **excess reserves**{: data-type=\"term\"} above the legally mandated limit. For example, during a recession banks may be hesitant to lend, because they fear that when the economy is contracting, a high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans.\n\nWhen many banks are choosing to hold excess reserves, expansionary monetary policy may not work well. This may occur because the banks are concerned about a deteriorating economy, while the central bank is trying to expand the money supply. If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level, the central bank cannot force individual banks to make loans. Similarly, sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a **recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, because they recognize that firms\u2019 sales and employees\u2019 jobs are more insecure in a recession, and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments. The result is that during an especially deep recession, an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the **real GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\nJapan experienced this situation in the 1990s and early 2000s. Japan\u2019s economy entered a period of very slow growth, dipping in and out of recession, in the early 1990s. By February 1999, the Bank of Japan had lowered the equivalent of its federal funds rate to 0%. It kept it there most of the time through 2003. Moreover, in the two years from March 2001 to March 2003, the Bank of Japan also expanded the money supply of the country by about 50%\u2014an enormous increase. Even this highly expansionary monetary policy, however, had no substantial effect on stimulating aggregate demand. Japan\u2019s economy continued to experience extremely slow growth into the mid-2000s.\n\n\n\nShould monetary policy decisions be made more democratically?\n\nShould monetary policy be conducted by a nation\u2019s Congress or legislature comprised of elected representatives? Or should it be conducted by a politically appointed central bank that is more independent of voters? Here are some of the arguments made by each side.\n\n*The Case for Greater Democratic Control of Monetary Policy*\n\nElected representatives conduct fiscal policy by passing tax and spending bills. They could handle monetary policy in the same way. Sure, they will sometimes make mistakes, but in a democracy, it is better to have mistakes made by elected officials accountable to voters than by political appointees. After all, the people appointed to the top governing positions at the Federal Reserve\u2014and to most central banks around the world\u2014are typically bankers and economists. They are not representatives of borrowers like small businesses or farmers nor are they representatives of labor unions. Central banks might not be so quick to raise interest rates if they had to pay more attention to firms and people in the real economy.\n\n*The Case for an Independent Central Bank*\n\nBecause the central bank has some insulation from day-to-day politics, its members can take a nonpartisan look at specific economic situations and make tough, immediate decisions when necessary. The idea of giving a legislature the ability to create money and hand out loans is likely to end up badly, sooner or later. It is simply too tempting for lawmakers to expand the money supply to fund their projects. The long term result will be rampant inflation. Also, a central bank, acting according to the laws passed by elected officials, can respond far more quickly than a legislature. For example, the U.S. budget takes months to debate, pass, and be signed into law, but monetary policy decisions can be made much more rapidly. Day-to-day democratic control of monetary policy is impractical and seems likely to lead to an overly expansionary monetary policy and higher inflation.\n\n\n\nThe problem of excess reserves does not affect contractionary policy. Central bankers have an old saying that monetary policy can be like pulling and pushing on a string: when the central bank pulls on the string and uses contractionary monetary policy, it can definitely raise interest rates and reduce aggregate demand. However, when the central bank tries to push on the string of expansionary monetary policy, the string may sometimes just fold up limp and have little effect, because banks decide not to loan out their excess reserves. This analogy should not be taken too literally\u2014expansionary monetary policy usually does have real effects, after that inconveniently long and variable lag. There are also times, like Japan\u2019s economy in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when expansionary monetary policy has been insufficient to lift a recession-prone economy.\n\n### Unpredictable Movements of Velocity\n\nVelocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy. The **velocity**{: data-type=\"term\"} of money in a year is defined as:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Velocity</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>nominal\u00a0GDP</mtext><mtext>money\u00a0supply</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nSpecific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply being used. Consider the velocity of **M1**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances. In 2009, for example, M1 was $1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $14.3 trillion, so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 ($14.3 trillion/$1.7 trillion). A higher velocity of money means that the average dollar circulates more times in a year; a lower velocity means that the average dollar circulates fewer times in a year.\n\nPerhaps you heard the \u201cd\u201d word mentioned during our recent economic downturn. See the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion of how deflation could affect monetary policy.\n\n\n\nWhat happens during episodes of deflation?\n\n**Deflation**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} occurs when the rate of inflation is negative; that is, instead of money having less purchasing power over time, as occurs with inflation, money is worth more. Deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address a recession.\n\nRemember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation. If the **nominal interest rate**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is 7% and the rate of inflation is 3%, then the borrower is effectively paying a 4% real interest rate. If the nominal interest rate is 7% and there is *deflation* of 2%, then the real interest rate is actually 9%. In this way, an unexpected deflation raises the real interest payments for borrowers. It can lead to a situation where an unexpectedly high number of loans are not repaid, and banks find that their net worth is decreasing or negative. When banks are suffering losses, they become less able and eager to make new loans. Aggregate demand declines, which can lead to recession.\n\nThen the double-whammy: After causing a recession, deflation can make it difficult for monetary policy to work. Say that the central bank uses expansionary monetary policy to reduce the nominal interest rate all the way to zero\u2014but the economy has 5% deflation. As a result, the real interest rate is 5%, and because a central bank cannot make the nominal interest rate negative, expansionary policy cannot reduce the real interest rate further.\n\nIn the U.S. economy during the early 1930s, deflation was 6.7% per year from 1930\u20131933, which caused many borrowers to default on their loans and many banks to end up bankrupt, which in turn contributed substantially to the Great Depression. Not all episodes of deflation, however, end in economic depression. Japan, for example, experienced deflation of slightly less than 1% per year from 1999\u20132002, which hurt the Japanese economy, but it still grew by about 0.9% per year over this period. Indeed, there is at least one historical example of deflation coexisting with rapid growth. The U.S. economy experienced deflation of about 1.1% per year over the quarter-century from 1876\u20131900, but real GDP also expanded at a rapid clip of 4% per year over this time, despite some occasional severe recessions.\n\nThe central bank should be on guard against deflation and, if necessary, use expansionary monetary policy to prevent any long-lasting or extreme deflation from occurring. Except in severe cases like the Great Depression, deflation does not guarantee economic disaster.\n\n\n\nChanges in velocity can cause problems for monetary policy. To understand why, rewrite the definition of velocity so that the money supply is on the left-hand side of the equation. That is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Money\u00a0supply\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0velocity\u00a0=\u00a0Nominal\u00a0GDP</mtext></math>\n\n\nRecall from [The Macroeconomic Perspective](/m48705) that\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Nominal GDP = Price Level (or GDP Deflator) x Real GDP.</mtext></math>\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Money Supply x velocity = Nominal GDP = Price Level x Real GDP.</mtext></math>\n\n\nThis equation is sometimes called the **basic quantity equation of money**{: data-type=\"term\"} but, as you can see, it is just the definition of velocity written in a different form. This equation must hold true, by definition.\n\nIf velocity is constant over time, then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left-hand side of the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in **nominal GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\u2014although this change could happen through an increase in inflation, or an increase in **real GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, or some combination of the two. If velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way, then changes in the money supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP. If velocity changes unpredictably over time, however, then the effect of changes in the money supply on nominal GDP becomes unpredictable.\n\nThe actual velocity of money in the U.S. economy as measured by using M1, the most common definition of the money supply, is illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econv1-2_C28_11). From 1960 up to about 1980, velocity appears fairly predictable; that is, it is increasing at a fairly constant rate. In the early 1980s, however, velocity as calculated with M1 becomes more variable. The reasons for these sharp changes in velocity remain a puzzle. Economists suspect that the changes in velocity are related to innovations in banking and finance which have changed how money is used in making economic transactions: for example, the growth of electronic payments; a rise in personal borrowing and credit card usage; and accounts that make it easier for people to hold money in savings accounts, where it is counted as M2, right up to the moment that they want to write a check on the money and transfer it to M1. So far at least, it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up-and-down fluctuations in M1. Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic banking, **M2**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is now favored as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econv1-2_C28_11 data-title=\"Velocity Calculated Using M1 \"}\n\nIn the 1970s, when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable, a number of economists, led by Nobel laureate **Milton Friedman**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (1912\u20132006), argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate. These economists argued that with the long and variable lags of monetary policy, and the political pressures on central bankers, central bank monetary policies were as likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects. Thus, these economists believed that the monetary policy should seek steady growth in the money supply of 3% per year. They argued that a steady rate of monetary growth would be correct over longer time periods, since it would roughly match the growth of the real economy. In addition, they argued that giving the central bank less discretion to conduct monetary policy would prevent an overly activist central bank from becoming a source of economic instability and uncertainty. In this spirit, Friedman wrote in 1967: \u201cThe first and most important lesson that history teaches about what monetary policy can do\u2014and it is a lesson of the most profound importance\u2014is that monetary policy can prevent money itself from being a major source of economic disturbance.\u201d\n\nAs the velocity of M1 began to fluctuate in the 1980s, having the money supply grow at a predetermined and unchanging rate seemed less desirable, because as the quantity theory of money shows, the combination of constant growth in the money supply and fluctuating velocity would cause nominal GDP to rise and fall in unpredictable ways. The jumpiness of velocity in the 1980s caused many central banks to focus less on the rate at which the quantity of money in the economy was increasing, and instead to set monetary policy by reacting to whether the economy was experiencing or in danger of higher inflation or unemployment.\n\n### Unemployment and Inflation\n\nIf you were to survey central bankers around the world and ask them what they believe should be the primary task of monetary policy, the most popular answer by far would be fighting inflation. Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term. Remember that in the **neoclassical model**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of the economy, the aggregate supply curve is drawn as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C28_009). In the neoclassical model, the level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP) is determined by real economic factors. If the original level of **aggregate demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is AD<sub>0</sub>, then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD<sub>1</sub> only creates an inflationary increase in the price level, but it does not alter GDP or unemployment. From this perspective, all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation\u2014and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy. After all, low inflation means that businesses making investments can focus on real economic issues, not on figuring out ways to protect themselves from the costs and risks of inflation. In this way, a consistent pattern of low inflation can contribute to long-term growth.\n\n  to the new equilibrium (E1) represents an inflationary increase in the price level from P0 to P1, but has no effect in the long run on output or the unemployment rate. In fact, no shift in AD will affect the equilibrium quantity of output in this model.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C28_009 data-title=\"Monetary Policy in a Neoclassical Model \"}\n\nThis vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice **inflation targeting**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low. By 2014, central banks in 28 countries, including Austria, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate. A notable exception is the **Federal Reserve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} in the United States, which does not practice inflation-targeting. Instead, the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account.\n\nEconomists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion. For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy, the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy\u2014even if the economy is already producing at **potential GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. In some countries, the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures, with the result of higher inflation, but no long-term reduction in unemployment. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a tradition of independence, but central banks in other countries may be under greater political pressure. For all of these reasons\u2014long and variable lags, excess reserves, unstable velocity, and controversy over economic goals\u2014monetary policy in the real world is often difficult. The basic message remains, however, that central banks can affect aggregate demand through the conduct of monetary policy and in that way influence macroeconomic outcomes.\n\n### Asset Bubbles and Leverage Cycles\n\nOne long-standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future. For example, from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the \u201cdot-com\u201d boom, the U.S. stock market, which is measured by the **Dow Jones**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} Industrial Index (which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy), nearly tripled in value. The **Nasdaq**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} index, which includes many smaller technology companies, increased in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000. These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable. Indeed, stock values as measured by the Dow Jones were almost 20% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. Stock values in the Nasdaq index were 50% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. The drop-off in stock market values contributed to the recession of 2001 and the higher unemployment that followed.\n\nA similar story can be told about housing prices in the mid-2000s. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, housing prices increased at about 6% per year on average. During what came to be known as the \u201chousing bubble\u201d from 2003 to 2005, housing prices increased at almost double this annual rate. These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable. When the price of housing fell in 2007 and 2008, many banks and households found that their assets were worth less than they expected, which contributed to the recession that started in 2007.\n\nAt a broader level, some economists worry about a **leverage cycle**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, where \u201cleverage\u201d is a term used by financial economists to mean \u201cborrowing.\u201d When economic times are good, banks and the financial sector are eager to lend, and people and firms are eager to borrow. Remember that the amount of money and credit in an economy is determined by a **money multiplier**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\u2014a process of loans being made, money being deposited, and more loans being made. In good economic times, this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth. It can even be part of what lead prices of certain assets\u2014like stock prices or housing prices\u2014to rise at unsustainably high annual rates. At some point, when economic times turn bad, banks and the financial sector become much less willing to lend, and credit becomes expensive or unavailable to many potential borrowers. The sharp reduction in credit, perhaps combined with the deflating prices of a dot-com stock price bubble or a housing bubble, makes the economic downturn worse than it would otherwise be.\n\nThus, some economists have suggested that the central bank should not just look at economic growth, inflation, and unemployment rates, but should also keep an eye on asset prices and leverage cycles. Such proposals are quite controversial. If a central bank had announced in 1997 that stock prices were rising \u201ctoo fast\u201d or in 2004 that housing prices were rising \u201ctoo fast,\u201d and then taken action to hold down price increases, many people and their elected political representatives would have been outraged. Neither the Federal Reserve nor any other central banks want to take the responsibility of deciding when stock prices and housing prices are too high, too low, or just right. As further research explores how asset price bubbles and leverage cycles can affect an economy, central banks may need to think about whether they should conduct monetary policy in a way that would seek to moderate these effects.\n\nLet\u2019s end this chapter with a Work it Out exercise in how the Fed\u2014or any central bank\u2014would stir up the economy by increasing the money supply.\n\n\n\nCalculating the Effects of Monetary Stimulus\n\nSuppose that the central bank wants to stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply. The bankers estimate that the velocity of money is 3, and that the price level will increase from 100 to 110 due to the stimulus. Using the quantity equation of money, what will be the impact of an $800 billion dollar increase in the money supply on the quantity of goods and services in the economy given an initial money supply of $4 trillion?\n\nStep 1. We begin by writing the quantity equation of money: MV = PQ. We know that initially V = 3, M = 4,000 (billion) and P = 100. Substituting these numbers in, we can solve for Q:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px 2px 2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>MV</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>PQ</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>4,000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Q</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Q</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>120</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 2. Now we want to find the effect of the addition $800 billion in the money supply, together with the increase in the price level. The new equation is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px 2px 2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>MV</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>PQ</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>4,800\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>110\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0Q</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Q</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>130.9</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 3. If we take the difference between the two quantities, we find that the monetary stimulus increased the quantity of goods and services in the economy by 10.9 billion.\n\n\n\nThe discussion in this chapter has focused on domestic monetary policy; that is, the view of monetary policy within an economy. [Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows](/m48776){: .target-chapter} explores the international dimension of monetary policy, and how monetary policy becomes involved with **exchange rates**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and international flows of **financial capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\n\n\nThe Problem of the Zero Percent Interest Rate Lower Bound\n\nIn 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in a difficult position. The federal funds rate was on its way to near zero, which meant that traditional open market operations, by which the Fed purchases U.S. Treasury Bills to lower short term interest rates, was no longer viable. This so called \u201czero bound problem,\u201d prompted the Fed, under then Chair Ben Bernanke, to attempt some unconventional policies, collectively called quantitative easing. By early 2014, quantitative easing nearly quintupled the amount of bank reserves. This likely contributed to the U.S. economy\u2019s recovery, but the impact was muted, probably due to some of the hurdles mentioned in the last section of this module. The unprecedented increase in bank reserves also led to fears of inflation. As of early 2015, however, there have been no serious signs of a boom, with core inflation around a stable 1.7%.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nMonetary policy is inevitably imprecise, for a number of reasons: (a) the effects occur only after long and variable lags; (b) if banks decide to hold excess reserves, monetary policy cannot force them to lend; and (c) velocity may shift in unpredictable ways. The basic quantity equation of money is MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the real output of the economy. Some central banks, like the European Central Bank, practice inflation targeting, which means that the only goal of the central bank is to keep inflation within a low target range. Other central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, are free to focus on either reducing inflation or stimulating an economy that is in recession, whichever goal seems most important at the time.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhy might banks want to hold excess reserves in time of recession?\n\n\n\nIn times of economic uncertainty, banks may worry that borrowers will lose the ability to repay their loans. They may also fear that a panic is more likely and they will need the excess reserves to meet their obligations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might the velocity of money change unexpectedly?\n\n\n\nIf consumer optimism changes, spending can speed up or slow down. This could also happen in a case where consumers need to buy a large number of items quickly, such as in a situation of national emergency.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhich kind of monetary policy would you expect in response to recession: expansionary or contractionary? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow might each of the following factors complicate the implementation of monetary policy: long and variable lags, excess reserves, and movements in velocity?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine the velocity of the money supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the basic quantity equation of money?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does a monetary policy of inflation targeting work?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nHow does rule-based monetary policy differ from discretionary monetary policy (that is, monetary policy not based on a rule)? What are some of the arguments for each?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it preferable for central banks to primarily target inflation or unemployment? Why?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nAll other things being equal, by how much will nominal GDP expand if the central bank increases the money supply by $100 billion, and the velocity of money is 3?

On January 1, 2002, one dollar was worth 1.11 euros. On April 24, 2008 it hit its lowest point with a dollar being worth 0.64 euros. During this period, the trade deficit between the United States and the European Union grew from a yearly total of approximately \u201385.7 billion dollars in 2002 to 95.8 billion dollars in 2008. Was this a good thing or a bad thing for the U.S. economy?\n\nWe live in a global world. U.S. consumers buy trillions of dollars worth of imported goods and services each year, not just from the European Union, but from all over the world. U.S. businesses sell trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of exports. U.S. citizens, businesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars abroad every year. Foreign investors, businesses, and governments invest trillions of dollars in the United States each year. Indeed, foreigners are a major buyer of U.S. federal debt.\n\nMany people feel that a weaker dollar is bad for America, that it\u2019s an indication of a weak economy. But is it? This chapter will help answer that question.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* How the Foreign Exchange Market Works\n* Demand and Supply Shifts in Foreign Exchange Markets\n* Macroeconomic Effects of Exchange Rates\n* Exchange Rate Policies\n\n\n\nThe world has over 150 different currencies, from the Afghanistan afghani and the Albanian lek all the way through the alphabet to the Zambian kwacha and the Zimbabwean dollar. For international economic transactions, households or firms will wish to exchange one currency for another. Perhaps the need for exchanging currencies will come from a German firm that exports products to Russia, but then wishes to exchange the Russian rubles it has earned for euros, so that the firm can pay its workers and suppliers in Germany. Perhaps it will be a South African firm that wishes to purchase a mining operation in Angola, but to make the purchase it must convert South African rand to Angolan kwanza. Perhaps it will be an American tourist visiting China, who wishes to convert U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan to pay the hotel bill.\n\nExchange rates can sometimes change very swiftly. For example, in the United Kingdom the pound was worth $2 in U.S. currency in spring 2008, but was worth only $1.40 in U.S. currency six months later. For firms engaged in international buying, selling, lending, and borrowing, these swings in exchange rates can have an enormous effect on profits.\n\nThis chapter discusses the international dimension of money, which involves conversions from one currency to another at an exchange rate. An **exchange rate**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is nothing more than a price\u2014that is, the price of one currency in terms of another currency\u2014and so they can be analyzed with the tools of **supply**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. The first module of this chapter begins with an overview of foreign exchange markets: their size, their main participants, and the vocabulary for discussing movements of exchange rates. The following module uses demand and supply graphs to analyze some of the main factors that cause shifts in exchange rates. A final module then brings the central bank and monetary policy back into the picture. Each country must decide whether to allow its exchange rate to be determined in the market, or have the central bank intervene in the exchange rate market. All the choices for exchange rate policy involve distinctive tradeoffs and risks.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

Sometimes small economies use the currency of an economically larger neighbor. For example, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Panama have decided to **dollarize**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014that is, to use the U.S. dollar as their currency. Sometimes nations share a common currency. A large-scale example of a common currency is the decision by 17 European nations\u2014including some very large economies such as France, Germany, and Italy\u2014to replace their former currencies with the euro. With these exceptions duly noted, most of the international economy takes place in a situation of multiple national currencies in which both people and firms need to convert from one currency to another when selling, buying, hiring, borrowing, traveling, or investing across national borders. The market in which people or firms use one currency to purchase another currency is called the **foreign exchange market**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nYou have encountered the basic concept of exchange rates in earlier chapters. In [The International Trade and Capital Flows](/m48731){: .target-chapter}, for example, we discussed how exchange rates are used to compare **GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} statistics from countries where GDP is measured in different currencies. These earlier examples, however, took the actual exchange rate as given, as if it were a fact of nature. In reality, the exchange rate is a price\u2014the price of one currency expressed in terms of units of another currency. The key framework for analyzing prices, whether in this course, any other economics course, in public policy, or business examples, is the operation of supply and demand in markets.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] for an exchange rate calculator.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### The Extraordinary Size of the Foreign Exchange Markets\n\nThe quantities traded in foreign exchange markets are breathtaking. A survey done in April, 2013 by the Bank of International Settlements, an international organization for banks and the financial industry, found that $5.3 trillion *per day* was traded on foreign exchange markets, which makes the foreign exchange market the largest market in the world economy. In contrast, 2013 U.S. real GDP was $15.8 trillion *per year*.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_29_01) shows the currencies most commonly traded on foreign exchange markets. The foreign exchange market is dominated by the U.S. dollar, the currencies used by nations in Western Europe (the euro, the British pound, and the Australian dollar), and the Japanese yen.\n\n<table id=\"Table_29_01\" summary=\"This table has two columns and ten rows. the first row is a header row and it labels the columns &#x201C;Currency&#x201D; and &#x201C;%Daily Share&#x201D;.

To get a sense of this, it is useful to consider four groups of people or firms who participate in the market: (1) **firms**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} that are involved in international trade of goods and services; (2) tourists visiting other countries; (3) international investors buying ownership (or part-ownership) of a foreign firm; (4) international investors making financial investments that do not involve ownership. Let\u2019s consider these categories in turn.\n\nFirms that buy and sell on international markets find that their costs for workers, suppliers, and investors are measured in the currency of the nation where their production occurs, but their revenues from sales are measured in the currency of the different nation where their sales happened. So, a Chinese firm exporting abroad will earn some other currency\u2014say, U.S. dollars\u2014but will need Chinese yuan to pay the workers, suppliers, and investors who are based in China. In the foreign exchange markets, this firm will be a supplier of U.S. dollars and a demander of Chinese yuan.\n\nInternational tourists will supply their home currency to receive the currency of the country they are visiting. For example, an American tourist who is visiting China will supply U.S. dollars into the foreign exchange market and demand Chinese yuan.\n\nFinancial investments that cross international boundaries, and require exchanging currency, are often divided into two categories. **Foreign direct investment (FDI)**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to purchasing a firm (at least ten percent) in another country or starting up a new enterprise in a foreign country For example, in 2008 the Belgian beer-brewing company InBev bought the U.S. beer-maker Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. To make this purchase of a U.S. firm, InBev would have to supply euros (the currency of Belgium) to the foreign exchange market and demand U.S. dollars.\n\nThe other kind of international financial investment, **portfolio investment**{: data-type=\"term\"}, involves a purely financial investment that does not entail any management responsibility. An example would be a U.S. financial investor who purchased bonds issued by the government of the United Kingdom, or deposited money in a British bank. To make such investments, the American investor would supply U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market and demand British pounds.\n\nPortfolio investment is often linked to expectations about how exchange rates will shift. Look at a U.S. financial investor who is considering purchasing bonds issued in the United Kingdom. For simplicity, ignore any interest paid by the bond (which will be small in the short run anyway) and focus on exchange rates. Say that a British pound is currently worth $1.50 in U.S. currency. However, the investor believes that in a month, the British pound will be worth $1.60 in U.S. currency. Thus, as [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_020) (a) shows, this investor would change $24,000 for 16,000 British pounds. In a month, if the pound is indeed worth $1.60, then the portfolio investor can trade back to U.S. dollars at the new exchange rate, and have $25,600\u2014a nice profit. A portfolio investor who believes that the foreign exchange rate for the pound will work in the opposite direction can also invest accordingly. Say that an investor expects that the pound, now worth $1.50 in U.S. currency, will decline to $1.40. Then, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_020) (b), that investor could start off with \u00a320,000 in British currency (borrowing the money if necessary), convert it to $30,000 in U.S. currency, wait a month, and then convert back to approximately \u00a321,429 in British currency\u2014again making a nice profit. Of course, this kind of investing comes without guarantees, and an investor will suffer losses if the exchange rates do not move as predicted.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C29_020 data-title=\"A Portfolio Investor Trying to Benefit from Exchange Rate Movements \"}\n\nMany portfolio investment decisions are not as simple as betting that the value of the currency will change in one direction or the other. Instead, they involve firms trying to protect themselves from movements in exchange rates. Imagine you are running a U.S. firm that is exporting to France. You have signed a contract to deliver certain products and will receive 1 million euros a year from now. But you do not know how much this contract will be worth in U.S. dollars, because the dollar/euro exchange rate can fluctuate in the next year. Let\u2019s say you want to know for sure what the contract will be worth, and not take a risk that the euro will be worth less in U.S. dollars than it currently is. You can **hedge**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which means using a financial transaction to protect yourself against a risk from one of your investments (in this case, currency risk from the contract). Specifically, you can sign a financial contract and pay a fee that guarantees you a certain exchange rate one year from now\u2014regardless of what the market exchange rate is at that time. Now, it is possible that the euro will be worth more in dollars a year from now, so your hedging contract will be unnecessary, and you will have paid a fee for nothing. But if the value of the euro in dollars declines, then you are protected by the hedge. Financial contracts like hedging, where parties wish to be protected against exchange rate movements, also commonly lead to a series of portfolio investments by the firm that is receiving a fee to provide the hedge.\n\nBoth foreign direct investment and portfolio investment involve an investor who supplies domestic currency and demands a foreign currency. With portfolio investment less than ten percent of a company is purchased. As such, portfolio investment is often made with a short term focus. With foreign direct investment more than ten percent of a company is purchased and the investor typically assumes some managerial responsibility; thus foreign direct investment tends to have a more long-run focus. As a practical matter, portfolio investments can be withdrawn from a country much more quickly than foreign direct investments. A U.S. portfolio investor who wants to buy or sell bonds issued by the government of the United Kingdom can do so with a phone call or a few clicks of a computer key. However, a U.S. firm that wants to buy or sell a company, such as one that manufactures automobile parts in the United Kingdom, will find that planning and carrying out the transaction takes a few weeks, even months. [\\[link\\]](#Table_29_02) summarizes the main categories of demanders and suppliers of currency.\n\n<table id=\"Table_29_02\" summary=\"This table has two columns and five rows.

Under the column &#x201C;Demand for the U.S. Dollar Comes from...&#x201D; are four sources: A U.S. exporting firm that earned foreign currency and is trying to pay U.S.-based expenses, Foreign tourists visiting the United States, Foreign investors who wish to make direct investments in the U.S. economy, and Foreign investors who wish to make portfolio investments in the U.S. Under the column &#x201C;Supply of the U.S. Dollar Comes from...&#x201D; are the following suppliers: A foreign firm that has sold imported goods in the United States, earned U.S. dollars, and is trying to pay expenses incurred in its home country, U.S. tourists leaving to visit other countries, U.S. investors who want to make foreign direct investments in other countries, and U.S. investors who want to make portfolio investments in other countries.\"><caption><span data-type=\"title\">The Demand and Supply Line-ups in Foreign Exchange Markets</span></caption><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Demand for the U.S. Dollar Comes from\u2026</th>\n<th>Supply of the U.S. Dollar Comes from\u2026</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>A U.S. exporting firm that earned foreign currency and is trying to pay U.S.-based expenses</td>\n<td>A foreign firm that has sold imported goods in the United States, earned U.S. dollars, and is trying to pay expenses incurred in its home country</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Foreign tourists visiting the United States</td>\n<td>U.S. tourists leaving to visit other countries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Foreign investors who wish to make direct investments in the U.S. economy</td>\n<td>U.S. investors who want to make foreign direct investments in other countries</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Foreign investors who wish to make portfolio investments in the U.S. economy</td>\n<td>U.S. investors who want to make portfolio investments in other countries</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n\n### Participants in the Exchange Rate Market\n\nThe foreign exchange market does not involve the ultimate suppliers and demanders of foreign exchange literally seeking each other out. If Martina decides to leave her home in Venezuela and take a trip in the United States, she does not need to find a U.S. citizen who is planning to take a vacation in Venezuela and arrange a person-to-person currency trade. Instead, the foreign exchange market works through financial institutions, and it operates on several levels.\n\nMost people and firms who are exchanging a substantial quantity of currency go to a bank, and most banks provide foreign exchange as a service to customers. These banks (and a few other firms), known as **dealers**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, then trade the foreign exchange. This is called the **interbank market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\nIn the world economy, roughly 2,000 firms are foreign exchange dealers. The U.S. economy has less than 100 foreign exchange dealers, but the largest 12 or so dealers carry out more than half the total transactions. The foreign exchange market has no central location, but the major dealers keep a close watch on each other at all times.\n\nThe foreign exchange market is huge not because of the demands of tourists, firms, or even foreign direct investment, but instead because of portfolio investment and the actions of interlocking foreign exchange dealers. International tourism is a very large industry, involving about $1 trillion per year. Global exports are about 23% of global GDP; which is about $18 trillion per year. Foreign direct investment totaled about $1.5 trillion in the end of 2013. These quantities are dwarfed, however, by the $5.3 trillion *per day* being traded in foreign exchange markets. Most transactions in the foreign exchange market are for portfolio investment\u2014relatively short-term movements of financial capital between currencies\u2014and because of the actions of the large foreign exchange dealers as they constantly buy and sell with each other.\n\n### Strengthening and Weakening Currency\n\nWhen the prices of most goods and services change, the price is said to \u201crise\u201d or \u201cfall.\u201d For exchange rates, the terminology is different. When the exchange rate for a currency rises, so that the currency exchanges for more of other currencies, it is referred to as **appreciating**{: data-type=\"term\"} or \u201cstrengthening.\u201d When the exchange rate for a currency falls, so that a currency trades for less of other currencies, it is referred to as **depreciating**{: data-type=\"term\"} or \u201cweakening.\u201d\n\nTo illustrate the use of these terms, consider the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar since 1980, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econv1-2_C29_03) (a). The vertical axis in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econv1-2_C29_03) (a) shows the price of $1 in U.S. currency, measured in terms of Canadian currency. Clearly, exchange rates can move up and down substantially. A U.S. dollar traded for $1.17 Canadian in 1980. The U.S. dollar appreciated or strengthened to $1.39 Canadian in 1986, depreciated or weakened to $1.15 Canadian in 1991, and then appreciated or strengthened to $1.60 Canadian by early in 2002, fell to roughly $1.20 Canadian in 2009, and then had a sharp spike up and decline in 2009 and 2010. The units in which exchange rates are measured can be confusing, because the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is being measured using a different currency\u2014the Canadian dollar. But exchange rates always measure the price of one unit of currency by using a different currency.\n\n , it is clear that the values in part (a) are a mirror image of part (b), which demonstrates that the depreciation of one currency correlates to the appreciation of the other and vice versa.  This means that when comparing the exchange rates between two countries (in this case, the United States and Canada), the depreciation (or weakening) of one country (the U.S. dollar for this example) indicates the appreciation (or strengthening) of the other currency (which in this example is the Canadian dollar). (Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) (a) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCAUS ; (b) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CCUSSP01CAQ650N)\"){: #CNX_Econv1-2_C29_03 data-title=\"Strengthen or Appreciate vs. Weaken or Depreciate \"}\n\nIn looking at the exchange rate between two currencies, the appreciation or strengthening of one currency must mean the depreciation or weakening of the other. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econv1-2_C29_03) (b) shows the exchange rate for the Canadian dollar, measured in terms of U.S. dollars. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar measured in Canadian dollars, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econv1-2_C29_03) (a), is a perfect mirror image with the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar measured in U.S. dollars, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econv1-2_C29_03) (b). A fall in the Canada $/U.S. $ ratio means a rise in the U.S. $/Canada $ ratio, and vice versa.\n\nWith the price of a typical good or service, it is clear that higher prices benefit sellers and hurt buyers, while lower prices benefit buyers and hurt sellers. In the case of exchange rates, where the buyers and sellers are not always intuitively obvious, it is useful to trace through how different participants in the market will be affected by a stronger or weaker currency. Consider, for example, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on six different groups of economic actors, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_005)\\: (1) U.S. exporters selling abroad; (2) foreign exporters (that is, firms selling imports in the U.S. economy); (3) U.S. tourists abroad; (4) foreign tourists visiting the United States; (5) U.S. investors (either foreign direct investment or portfolio investment) considering opportunities in other countries; (6) and foreign investors considering opportunities in the U.S. economy.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C29_005 data-title=\"How Do Exchange Rate Movements Affect Each Group? \"}\n\nFor a U.S. firm selling abroad, a stronger U.S. dollar is a curse. A strong U.S. dollar means that foreign currencies are correspondingly weak. When this exporting firm earns foreign currencies through its export sales, and then converts them back to U.S. dollars to pay workers, suppliers, and investors, the stronger dollar means that the foreign currency buys fewer U.S. dollars than if the currency had not strengthened, and that the firm\u2019s profits (as measured in dollars) fall. As a result, the firm may choose to reduce its exports, or it may raise its selling price, which will also tend to reduce its exports. In this way, a stronger currency reduces a country\u2019s exports.\n\nConversely, for a foreign firm selling in the U.S. economy, a stronger dollar is a blessing. Each dollar earned through export sales, when traded back into the home currency of the exporting firm, will now buy more of the home currency than expected before the dollar had strengthened. As a result, the stronger dollar means that the importing firm will earn higher profits than expected. The firm will seek to expand its sales in the U.S. economy, or it may reduce prices, which will also lead to expanded sales. In this way, a stronger U.S. dollar means that consumers will purchase more from foreign producers, expanding the country\u2019s level of imports.\n\nFor a U.S. tourist abroad, who is exchanging U.S. dollars for foreign currency as necessary, a stronger U.S. dollar is a benefit. The tourist receives more foreign currency for each U.S. dollar, and consequently the cost of the trip in U.S. dollars is lower. When a country\u2019s currency is strong, it is a good time for citizens of that country to tour abroad. Imagine a U.S. tourist who has saved up $5,000 for a trip to South Africa. In January 2008, $1 bought 7 South African rand, so the tourist had 35,000 rand to spend. In January 2009, $1 bought 10 rand, so the tourist had 50,000 rand to spend. By January 2010, $1 bought only 7.5 rand. Clearly, 2009 was the year for U.S. tourists to visit South Africa. For foreign visitors to the United States, the opposite pattern holds true. A relatively stronger U.S. dollar means that their own currencies are relatively weaker, so that as they shift from their own currency to U.S. dollars, they have fewer U.S. dollars than previously. When a country\u2019s currency is strong, it is not an especially good time for foreign tourists to visit.\n\nA stronger dollar injures the prospects of a U.S. financial investor who has already invested money in another country. A U.S. financial investor abroad must first convert U.S. dollars to a foreign currency, invest in a foreign country, and then later convert that foreign currency back to U.S. dollars. If in the meantime the U.S. dollar becomes stronger and the foreign currency becomes weaker, then when the investor converts back to U.S. dollars, the rate of return on that investment will be less than originally expected at the time it was made.\n\nHowever, a stronger U.S. dollar boosts the returns of a foreign investor putting money into a U.S. investment. That foreign investor converts from the home currency to U.S. dollars and seeks a U.S. investment, while later planning to switch back to the home currency. If, in the meantime, the dollar grows stronger, then when the time comes to convert from U.S. dollars back to the foreign currency, the investor will receive more foreign currency than expected at the time the original investment was made.\n\nThe preceding paragraphs all focus on the case where the U.S. dollar becomes stronger. The corresponding happy or unhappy economic reactions are illustrated in the first column of [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_005). The following Work It Out feature centers the analysis on the opposite: a weaker dollar.\n\n\n\nEffects of a Weaker Dollar\n\nLet\u2019s work through the effects of a weaker dollar on a U.S. exporter, a foreign exporter into the United States, a U.S. tourist going abroad, a foreign tourist coming to the United States, a U.S. investor abroad, and a foreign investor in the United States.\n\nStep 1. Note that the demand for U.S. exports is a function of the price of those exports, which depends on the dollar price of those goods and the exchange rate of the dollar in terms of foreign currency. For example, a Ford pickup truck costs $25,000 in the United States. When it is sold in the United Kingdom, the price is $25,000 / $1.50 per British pound, or \u00a316,667. The dollar affects the price faced by foreigners who may purchase U.S. exports.\n\nStep 2. Consider that, if the dollar weakens, the pound rises in value. If the pound rises to $2.00 per pound, then the price of a Ford pickup is now $25,000 / $2.00 = \u00a312,500. A weaker dollar means the foreign currency buys more dollars, which means that U.S. exports appear less expensive.\n\nStep 3. Summarize that a weaker U.S. dollar leads to an increase in U.S. exports. For a foreign exporter, the outcome is just the opposite.\n\nStep 4. Suppose a brewery in England is interested in selling its Bass Ale to a grocery store in the United States. If the price of a six pack of Bass Ale is \u00a36.00 and the exchange rate is $1.50 per British pound, the price for the grocery store is 6.00 \u00d7 $1.50 = $9.00 per six pack. If the dollar weakens to $2.00 per pound, the price of Bass Ale is now 6.00 \u00d7 $2.00 = $12.\n\nStep 5. Summarize that, from the perspective of U.S. purchasers, a weaker dollar means that foreign currency is more expensive, which means that foreign goods are more expensive also. This leads to a decrease in U.S. imports, which is bad for the foreign exporter.\n\nStep 6. Consider U.S. tourists going abroad. They face the same situation as a U.S. importer\u2014they are purchasing a foreign trip. A weaker dollar means that their trip will cost more, since a given expenditure of foreign currency (e.g., hotel bill) will take more dollars. The result is that the tourist may not stay as long abroad, and some may choose not to travel at all.\n\nStep 7. Consider that, for the foreign tourist to the United States, a weaker dollar is a boon. It means their currency goes further, so the cost of a trip to the United States will be less. Foreigners may choose to take longer trips to the United States, and more foreign tourists may decide to take U.S. trips.\n\nStep 8. Note that a U.S. investor abroad faces the same situation as a U.S. importer\u2014they are purchasing a foreign asset. A U.S. investor will see a weaker dollar as an increase in the \u201cprice\u201d of investment, since the same number of dollars will buy less foreign currency and thus less foreign assets. This should decrease the amount of U.S. investment abroad.\n\nStep 9. Note also that foreign investors in the Unites States will have the opposite experience. Since foreign currency buys more dollars, they will likely invest in more U.S. assets.\n\n\n\nAt this point, you should have a good sense of the major players in the foreign exchange market: firms involved in international trade, tourists, international financial investors, banks, and foreign exchange dealers. The next module shows how the tools of demand and supply can be used in foreign exchange markets to explain the underlying causes of stronger and weaker currencies (\u201cstronger\u201d and \u201cweaker\u201d addressed more in the following Clear It Up feature).\n\n\n\nWhy is a stronger currency not necessarily better?\n\nOne common misunderstanding about exchange rates is that a \u201cstronger\u201d or \u201cappreciating\u201d currency must be better than a \u201cweaker\u201d or \u201cdepreciating\u201d currency. After all, is it not obvious that \u201cstrong\u201d is better than \u201cweak\u201d? But do not let the terminology confuse you. When a currency becomes stronger, so that it purchases more of other currencies, it benefits some in the economy and injures others. Stronger currency is not necessarily better, it is just different.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nIn the foreign exchange market, people and firms exchange one currency to purchase another currency. The demand for dollars comes from those U.S. export firms seeking to convert their earnings in foreign currency back into U.S. dollars; foreign tourists converting their earnings in a foreign currency back into U.S. dollars; and foreign investors seeking to make financial investments in the U.S. economy. On the supply side of the foreign exchange market for the trading of U.S. dollars are foreign firms that have sold imports in the U.S. economy and are seeking to convert their earnings back to their home currency; U.S. tourists abroad; and U.S. investors seeking to make financial investments in foreign economies. When currency A can buy more of currency B, then currency A has strengthened or appreciated relative to B. When currency A can buy less of currency B, then currency A has weakened or depreciated relative to B. If currency A strengthens or appreciates relative to currency B, then currency B must necessarily weaken or depreciate with regard to currency A. A stronger currency benefits those who are buying with that currency and injures those who are selling. A weaker currency injures those, like importers, who are buying with that currency and benefits those who are selling with it, like exporters.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nHow will a stronger euro affect the following economic agents?\n\n1.  A British exporter to Germany.\n2.  A Dutch tourist visiting Chile.\n3.  A Greek bank investing in a Canadian government bond.\n4.  A French exporter to Germany.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.  The British use the pound sterling, while Germans use the euro, so a British exporter will receive euros from export sales, which will need to be exchanged for pounds. A stronger euro will mean more pounds per euro, so the exporter will be better off. In addition, the lower price for German imports will stimulate demand for British exports. For both these reasons, a stronger euro benefits the British exporter.\n2.  The Dutch use euros while the Chileans use pesos, so the Dutch tourist needs to turn euros into Chilean pesos. An increase in the euro means that the tourist will get more pesos per euro. As a consequence, the Dutch tourist will have a less expensive vacation than he planned, so the tourist will be better off.\n3.  The Greek use euros while the Canadians use dollars. An increase in the euro means it will buy more Canadian dollars. As a result, the Greek bank will see a decrease in the cost of the Canadian bonds, so it may purchase more bonds. Either way, the Greek bank benefits.\n4.  Since both the French and Germans use the euro, an increase in the euro, in terms of other currencies, should have no impact on the French exporter.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the foreign exchange market?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe some buyers and some sellers in the market for U.S. dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between foreign direct investment and portfolio investment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to hedge a financial transaction?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to say that a currency appreciates?

The vertical axis shows the exchange rate for Mexican pesos, which is measured in U.S. dollars. The horizontal axis shows the quantity of Mexican pesos traded in the foreign exchange market. The **demand curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (D) for Mexican pesos intersects with the **supply curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (S) of Mexican pesos at the equilibrium point (E), which is an exchange rate of 10 cents in U.S. currency for each Mexican peso and a total volume of 85 billion pesos. Note that the two exchange rates are inverses: 10 pesos per dollar is the same as 10 cents per peso (or $0.10 per peso). In the actual foreign exchange market, almost all of the trading for Mexican pesos is done for U.S. dollars. What factors would cause the demand or supply to shift, thus leading to a change in the **equilibrium exchange rate**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}? The answer to this question is discussed in the following section.\n\n### Expectations about Future Exchange Rates\n\nOne reason to demand a currency on the foreign exchange market is the belief that the value of the currency is about to increase. One reason to supply a currency\u2014that is, sell it on the foreign exchange market\u2014is the expectation that the value of the currency is about to decline. For example, imagine that a leading business newspaper, like the *Wall Street Journal* or the *Financial Times*, runs an article predicting that the Mexican peso will appreciate in value. The likely effects of such an article are illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_008). Demand for the Mexican peso shifts to the right, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>, as investors become eager to purchase pesos. Conversely, the supply of pesos shifts to the left, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>, because investors will be less willing to give them up. The result is that the equilibrium exchange rate rises from 10 cents/peso to 12 cents/peso and the equilibrium exchange rate rises from 85 billion to 90 billion pesos as the equilibrium moves from E<sub>0</sub> to E<sub>1</sub>.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C29_008 data-title=\"Exchange Rate Market for Mexican Peso Reacts to Expectations about Future Exchange Rates \"}\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_008) also illustrates some peculiar traits of supply and demand diagrams in the foreign exchange market. In contrast to all the other cases of supply and demand you have considered, in the **foreign exchange market**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, supply and demand typically both move at the same time. Groups of participants in the foreign exchange market like firms and investors include some who are buyers and some who are sellers. An expectation of a future shift in the exchange rate affects both buyers and sellers\u2014that is, it affects both demand and supply for a currency.\n\nThe shifts in demand and supply curves both cause the exchange rate to shift in the same direction; in this example, they both make the peso exchange rate stronger. However, the shifts in demand and supply work in opposing directions on the quantity traded. In this example, the rising demand for pesos is causing the quantity to rise while the falling supply of pesos is causing quantity to fall. In this specific example, the result is a higher quantity. But in other cases, the result could be that quantity remains unchanged or declines.\n\nThis example also helps to explain why exchange rates often move quite substantially in a short period of a few weeks or months. When investors expect a country\u2019s currency to strengthen in the future, they buy the currency and cause it to appreciate immediately. The appreciation of the currency can lead other investors to believe that future appreciation is likely\u2014and thus lead to even further appreciation. Similarly, a fear that a currency *might* weaken quickly leads to an *actual* weakening of the currency, which often reinforces the belief that the currency is going to weaken further. Thus, beliefs about the future path of exchange rates can be self-reinforcing, at least for a time, and a large share of the trading in foreign exchange markets involves dealers trying to outguess each other on what direction exchange rates will move next.\n\n### Differences across Countries in Rates of Return\n\nThe motivation for investment, whether domestic or foreign, is to earn a return. If rates of return in a country look relatively high, then that country will tend to attract funds from abroad. Conversely, if rates of return in a country look relatively low, then funds will tend to flee to other economies. Changes in the expected rate of return will shift demand and supply for a currency. For example, imagine that interest rates rise in the United States as compared with Mexico. Thus, financial investments in the United States promise a higher return than they previously did. As a result, more investors will demand U.S. dollars so that they can buy interest-bearing assets and fewer investors will be willing to supply U.S. dollars to foreign exchange markets. Demand for the U.S. dollar will shift to the right, from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>, and supply will shift to the left, from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_009). The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>), will occur at an exchange rate of nine pesos/dollar and the same quantity of $8.5 billion. Thus, a higher interest rate or rate of return relative to other countries leads a nation\u2019s currency to appreciate or strengthen, and a lower interest rate relative to other countries leads a nation\u2019s currency to depreciate or weaken. Since a nation\u2019s central bank can use monetary policy to affect its interest rates, a central bank can also cause changes in exchange rates\u2014a connection that will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.\n\n  has a stronger exchange rate than the original equilibrium (E0), but in this example, the equilibrium quantity traded does not change.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C29_009 data-title=\"Exchange Rate Market for U.S. Dollars Reacts to Higher Interest Rates \"}\n\n### Relative Inflation\n\nIf a country experiences a relatively high inflation rate compared with other economies, then the buying power of its currency is eroding, which will tend to discourage anyone from wanting to acquire or to hold the currency. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_010) shows an example based on an actual episode concerning the Mexican peso. In 1986\u201387, Mexico experienced an inflation rate of over 200%. Not surprisingly, as inflation dramatically decreased the purchasing power of the peso in Mexico, the exchange rate value of the peso declined as well. As shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_010), demand for the peso on foreign exchange markets decreased from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>, while supply of the peso increased from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>. The equilibrium exchange rate fell from $2.50 per peso at the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) to $0.50 per peso at the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>). In this example, the quantity of pesos traded on foreign exchange markets remained the same, even as the exchange rate shifted.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C29_010 data-title=\"Exchange Rate Markets React to Higher Inflation \"}\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to learn about the Big Mac index.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Purchasing Power Parity\n\nOver the long term, exchange rates must bear some relationship to the buying power of the currency in terms of goods that are internationally traded. If at a certain exchange rate it was much cheaper to buy internationally traded goods\u2014such as oil, steel, computers, and cars\u2014in one country than in another country, businesses would start buying in the cheap country, selling in other countries, and pocketing the profits.\n\nFor example, if a U.S. dollar is worth $1.60 in Canadian currency, then a car that sells for $20,000 in the United States should sell for $32,000 in Canada. If the price of cars in Canada was much lower than $32,000, then at least some U.S. car-buyers would convert their U.S. dollars to Canadian dollars and buy their cars in Canada. If the price of cars was much higher than $32,000 in this example, then at least some Canadian buyers would convert their Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars and go to the United States to purchase their cars. This is known as **arbitrage**{: data-type=\"term\"}, the process of buying and selling goods or currencies across international borders at a profit. It may occur slowly, but over time, it will force prices and exchange rates to align so that the price of internationally traded goods is similar in all countries.\n\nThe exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries is called the **purchasing power parity (PPP)**{: data-type=\"term\"} exchange rate. A group of economists at the International Comparison Program, run by the World Bank, have calculated the PPP exchange rate for all countries, based on detailed studies of the prices and quantities of internationally tradable goods.\n\nThe purchasing power parity exchange rate has two functions. First, PPP exchange rates are often used for international comparison of GDP and other economic statistics. Imagine that you are preparing a table showing the size of **GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} in many countries in several recent years, and for ease of comparison, you are converting all the values into U.S. dollars. When you insert the value for Japan, you need to use a yen/dollar exchange rate. But should you use the market exchange rate or the PPP exchange rate? Market exchange rates bounce around. In summer 2008, the exchange rate was 108 yen/dollar, but in late 2009 the U.S. dollar exchange rate versus the yen was 90 yen/dollar. For simplicity, say that Japan\u2019s GDP was \u00a5500 trillion in both 2008 and 2009. If you use the market exchange rates, then Japan\u2019s GDP will be $4.6 trillion in 2008 (that is, \u00a5500 trillion /(\u00a5108/dollar)) and $5.5 trillion in 2009 (that is, \u00a5500 trillion /(\u00a590/dollar)).\n\nOf course, it is not true that Japan\u2019s economy increased enormously in 2009\u2014in fact, Japan had a recession like much of the rest of the world. The misleading appearance of a booming Japanese economy occurs only because we used the market exchange rate, which often has short-run rises and falls. However, PPP exchange rates stay fairly constant and change only modestly, if at all, from year to year.\n\nThe second function of PPP is that exchanges rates will often get closer and closer to it as time passes. It is true that in the short run and medium run, as exchange rates adjust to relative inflation rates, rates of return, and to expectations about how interest rates and inflation will shift, the exchange rates will often move away from the PPP exchange rate for a time. But, knowing the PPP will allow you to track and predict exchange rate relationships.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nIn the extreme short run, ranging from a few minutes to a few weeks, exchange rates are influenced by speculators who are trying to invest in currencies that will grow stronger, and to sell currencies that will grow weaker. Such speculation can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, at least for a time, where an expected appreciation leads to a stronger currency and vice versa. In the relatively short run, exchange rate markets are influenced by differences in rates of return. Countries with relatively high real rates of return (for example, high interest rates) will tend to experience stronger currencies as they attract money from abroad, while countries with relatively low rates of return will tend to experience weaker exchange rates as investors convert to other currencies.\n\nIn the medium run of a few months or a few years, exchange rate markets are influenced by inflation rates. Countries with relatively high inflation will tend to experience less demand for their currency than countries with lower inflation, and thus currency depreciation. Over long periods of many years, exchange rates tend to adjust toward the purchasing power parity (PPP) rate, which is the exchange rate such that the prices of internationally tradable goods in different countries, when converted at the PPP exchange rate to a common currency, are similar in all economies.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nSuppose that political unrest in Egypt leads financial markets to anticipate a depreciation in the Egyptian pound. How will that affect the demand for pounds, supply of pounds, and exchange rate for pounds compared to, say, U.S. dollars?\n\n\n\nExpected depreciation in a currency will lead people to divest themselves of the currency. We should expect to see an increase in the supply of pounds and a decrease in demand for pounds. The result should be a decrease in the value of the pound *vis \u00e0 vis* the dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose U.S. interest rates decline compared to the rest of the world. What would be the likely impact on the demand for dollars, supply of dollars, and exchange rate for dollars compared to, say, euros?\n\n\n\nLower U.S. interest rates make U.S. assets less desirable compared to assets in the European Union. We should expect to see a decrease in demand for dollars and an increase in supply of dollars in foreign currency markets. As a result, we should expect to see the dollar depreciate compared to the euro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose Argentina gets inflation under control and the Argentine inflation rate decreases substantially. What would likely happen to the demand for Argentine pesos, the supply of Argentine pesos, and the peso/U.S. dollar exchange rate?\n\n\n\nA decrease in Argentine inflation relative to other countries should cause an increase in demand for pesos, a decrease in supply of pesos, and an appreciation of the peso in foreign currency markets.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nDoes an expectation of a stronger exchange rate in the future affect the exchange rate in the present? If so, how?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes a higher rate of return in a nation\u2019s economy, all other things being equal, affect the exchange rate of its currency? If so, how?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes a higher inflation rate in an economy, other things being equal, affect the exchange rate of its currency? If so, how?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the purchasing power parity exchange rate?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nIf a country\u2019s currency is expected to appreciate in value, what would you think will be the impact of expected exchange rates on yields (e.g., the interest rate paid on government bonds) in that country? *Hint*: Think about how expected exchange rate changes and interest rates affect demand and supply for a currency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you think that a country experiencing hyperinflation is more or less likely to have an exchange rate equal to its purchasing power parity value when compared to a country with a low inflation rate?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\narbitrage\n: the process of buying a good and selling goods across borders to take advantage of international price differences\n^\n\npurchasing power parity (PPP)\n: the exchange rate that equalizes the prices of internationally traded goods across countries\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/bigmac", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48788", "module_title": "Economics - m48788", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48788", "text": "By the end of this section you will be able to:\n\n* Explain how exchange rate shifting influences aggregate demand and supply\n* Explain how loans and banks can also be influenced by shifting exchange rates\n\n\n\nA **central bank**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} will be concerned about the exchange rate for multiple reasons: (1) Movements in the exchange rate will affect the quantity of aggregate demand in an economy; (2) frequent substantial fluctuations in the exchange rate can disrupt international trade and cause problems in a nation\u2019s banking system\u2013this may contribute to an unsustainable balance of trade and large inflows of international financial capital, which can set the economy up for a deep recession if international investors decide to move their money to another country. Let\u2019s discuss these scenarios in turn.\n\n### Exchange Rates, Aggregate Demand, and Aggregate Supply\n\nForeign trade in goods and services typically involves incurring the costs of production in one currency while receiving revenues from sales in another currency. As a result, movements in exchange rates can have a powerful effect on incentives to export and import, and thus on **aggregate demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} in the economy as a whole.\n\nFor example, in 1999, when the euro first became a currency, its value measured in U.S. currency was $1.06/euro. By the end of 2013, the euro had risen (and the U.S. dollar had correspondingly weakened) to $1.37/euro. Consider the situation of a French firm that each year incurs \u20ac10 million in costs, and sells its products in the United States for $10 million. In 1999, when this firm converted $10 million back to euros at the exchange rate of $1.06/euro (that is, $10 million \u00d7 \\[\u20ac1/$1.06\\]), it received \u20ac9.4 million, and suffered a loss. In 2013, when this same firm converted $10 million back to euros at the exchange rate of $1.37/euro (that is, $10 million \u00d7 \\[\u20ac1 euro/$1.37\\]), it received approximately \u20ac7.3 million and an even larger loss. This example shows how a stronger euro discourages exports by the French firm, because it makes the costs of production in the domestic currency higher relative to the sales revenues earned in another country. From the point of view of the U.S. economy, the example also shows how a weaker U.S. dollar encourages **exports**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\nSince an increase in exports results in more dollars flowing into the economy, and an increase in imports means more dollars are flowing out, it is easy to conclude that exports are \u201cgood\u201d for the economy and imports are \u201cbad,\u201d but this overlooks the role of exchange rates. If an American consumer buys a Japanese car for $20,000 instead of an American car for $30,000, it may be tempting to argue that the American economy has lost out. However, the Japanese company will have to convert those dollars to yen to pay its workers and operate its factories. Whoever buys those dollars will have to use them to purchase American goods and services, so the money comes right back into the American economy. At the same time, the consumer saves money by buying a less expensive import, and can use the extra money for other purposes.\n\n### Fluctuations in Exchange Rates\n\nExchange rates can fluctuate a great deal in the short run. As yet one more example, the Indian rupee moved from 39 rupees/dollar in February 2008 to 51 rupees/dollar in March 2009, a decline of more than one-fourth in the value of the rupee on foreign exchange markets. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_014) earlier showed that even two economically developed neighboring economies like the United States and Canada can see significant movements in exchange rates over a few years. For firms that depend on export sales, or firms that rely on imported inputs to production, or even purely domestic firms that compete with firms tied into international trade\u2014which in many countries adds up to half or more of a nation\u2019s GDP\u2014sharp movements in exchange rates can lead to dramatic changes in profits and losses. So, a central bank may desire to keep exchange rates from moving too much as part of providing a stable business climate, where firms can focus on productivity and innovation, not on reacting to exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nOne of the most economically destructive effects of exchange rate fluctuations can happen through the banking system. Most international loans are measured in a few large currencies, like U.S. dollars, European euros, and Japanese yen. In countries that do not use these currencies, banks often borrow funds in the currencies of other countries, like U.S. dollars, but then lend in their own domestic currency. The left-hand chain of events in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_014) shows how this pattern of international borrowing can work. A bank in Thailand borrows one million in U.S. dollars. Then the bank converts the dollars to its domestic currency\u2014in the case of Thailand, the currency is the baht\u2014at a rate of 40 baht/dollar. The bank then lends the baht to a firm in Thailand. The business repays the loan in baht, and the bank converts it back to U.S. dollars to pay off its original U.S. dollar loan.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C29_014 data-title=\"International Borrowing \"}\n\nThis process of borrowing in a foreign currency and lending in a domestic currency can work just fine, as long as the exchange rate does not shift. In the scenario outlined, if the dollar strengthens and the baht weakens, a problem arises. The right-hand chain of events in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_014) illustrates what happens when the baht unexpectedly weakens from 40 baht/dollar to 50 baht/dollar. The Thai firm still repays the loan in full to the bank. But because of the shift in the exchange rate, the bank cannot repay its loan in U.S. dollars. (Of course, if the exchange rate had changed in the other direction, making the Thai currency stronger, the bank could have realized an unexpectedly large profit.)\n\nIn 1997\u20131998, countries across eastern Asia, like Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia, experienced a sharp depreciation of their currencies, in some cases 50% or more. These countries had been experiencing substantial inflows of **foreign investment capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, with bank lending increasing by 20% to 30% per year through the mid-1990s. When their exchange rates depreciated, the banking systems in these countries were bankrupt. Argentina experienced a similar chain of events in 2002. When the Argentine peso depreciated, Argentina\u2019s banks found themselves unable to pay back what they had borrowed in U.S. dollars.\n\nBanks play a vital role in any economy in facilitating transactions and in making loans to firms and consumers. When most of a country\u2019s largest banks become **bankrupt**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} simultaneously, a sharp decline in aggregate demand and a deep recession results. Since the main responsibilities of a central bank are to control the money supply and to ensure that the banking system is stable, a central bank must be concerned about whether large and unexpected exchange rate depreciation will drive most of the country\u2019s existing banks into bankruptcy. For more on this concern, return to the chapter on [The International Trade and Capital Flows](#m48731).\n\n### Summing Up Public Policy and Exchange Rates\n\nEvery nation would prefer a stable exchange rate to facilitate **international trade**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and reduce the degree of risk and uncertainty in the economy. However, a nation may sometimes want a weaker exchange rate to stimulate aggregate demand and reduce a recession, or a stronger exchange rate to fight inflation. The country must also be concerned that rapid movements from a weak to a strong exchange rate may cripple its export industries, while rapid movements from a strong to a weak exchange rate can cripple its banking sector. In short, every choice of an exchange rate\u2014whether it should be stronger or weaker, or fixed or changing\u2014represents potential tradeoffs.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA central bank will be concerned about the exchange rate for several reasons. Exchange rates will affect imports and exports, and thus affect aggregate demand in the economy. Fluctuations in exchange rates may cause difficulties for many firms, but especially banks. The exchange rate may accompany unsustainable flows of international financial capital.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nThis chapter has explained that \u201cone of the most economically destructive effects of exchange rate fluctuations can happen through the banking system,\u201d if banks borrow from abroad to lend domestically. Why is this less likely to be a problem for the U.S. banking system?\n\n\n\nThe problem occurs when banks borrow foreign currency but lend in domestic currency. Since banks\u2019 assets (loans they made) are in domestic currency, while their debts (money they borrowed) are in foreign currency, when the domestic currency declines, their debts grow larger. If the domestic currency falls substantially in value, as happened during the Asian financial crisis, then the banking system could fail. This problem is unlikely to occur for U.S. banks because, even when they borrow from abroad, they tend to borrow dollars. Remember, there are trillions of dollars in circulation in the global economy. Since both assets and debts are in dollars, a change in the value of the dollar does not cause banking system failure the way it can when banks borrow in foreign currency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA booming economy can attract financial capital inflows, which promote further growth. But capital can just as easily flow out of the country, leading to economic recession. Is a country whose economy is booming because it decided to stimulate consumer spending more or less likely to experience capital flight than an economy whose boom is caused by economic investment expenditure?\n\n\n\nWhile capital flight is possible in either case, if a country borrows to invest in real capital it is more likely to be able to generate the income to pay back its debts than a country that borrows to finance consumption. As a result, an investment-stimulated economy is less likely to provoke capital flight and economic recession.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the reasons a central bank is likely to care, at least to some extent, about the exchange rate?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can an unexpected fall in exchange rates injure the financial health of a nation\u2019s banks?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nSuppose a country has an overall balance of trade so that exports of goods and services equal imports of goods and services. Does that imply that the country has balanced trade with *each* of its trading partners?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe learned that monetary policy is amplified by changes in exchange rates and the corresponding changes in the balance of trade. From the perspective of a nation\u2019s central bank, is this a good thing or a bad thing?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a developing country needs foreign capital inflows, management expertise, and technology, how can it encourage foreign investors while at the same time protect itself against capital flight and banking system collapse, as happened during the Asian financial crisis?", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

Let\u2019s discuss each type of exchange rate policy and its tradeoffs.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C29_016 data-title=\"A Spectrum of Exchange Rate Policies \"}\n\n### Floating Exchange Rates\n\nA policy which allows the foreign exchange market to set exchange rates is referred to as a **floating exchange rate**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The U.S. dollar is a floating exchange rate, as are the currencies of about 40% of the countries in the world economy. The major concern with this policy is that exchange rates can move a great deal in a short time.\n\nConsider the U.S. exchange rate expressed in terms of another fairly stable currency, the Japanese yen, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_017). On January 1, 2002, the exchange rate was 133 yen/dollar. On January 1, 2005, it was 103 yen/dollar. On June 1, 2007, it was 122 yen/dollar, on January 1, 2012, it was 77 yen per dollar, and on March 1, 2015, it was 120 yen per dollar. As investor sentiment swings back and forth, driving exchange rates up and down, exporters, importers, and banks involved in international lending are all affected. At worst, large movements in exchange rates can drive companies into bankruptcy or trigger a nationwide banking collapse. But even in the moderate case of the yen/dollar exchange rate, these movements of roughly 30 percent back and forth impose stress on both economies as firms must alter their export and import plans to take the new exchange rates into account. Especially in smaller countries where international trade is a relatively large share of GDP, exchange rate movements can rattle their economies.\n\n by about 14% and again at the end of the year in 2014 also by about 14%. (Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/DEXJPUS)\"){: #CNX_Econ_C29_017 data-title=\"U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate in Japanese Yen \"}\n\nHowever, movements of floating exchange rates have advantages, too. After all, prices of goods and services rise and fall throughout a market economy, as demand and supply shift. If an economy experiences strong inflows or outflows of international financial capital, or has relatively high inflation, or if it experiences strong productivity growth so that purchasing power changes relative to other economies, then it makes economic sense for the exchange rate to shift as well.\n\nFloating exchange rate advocates often argue that if government policies were more predictable and stable, then inflation rates and interest rates would be more predictable and stable. Exchange rates would bounce around less, too. The economist **Milton Friedman**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (1912\u20132006), for example, wrote a defense of floating exchange rates in 1962 in his book *Capitalism and Freedom*\\:\n\n<q>Being in favor of floating exchange rates does not mean being in favor of unstable exchange rates. When we support a free price system \\[for goods and services\\] at home, this does not imply that we favor a system in which prices fluctuate wildly up and down. What we want is a system in which prices are free to fluctuate but in which the forces determining them are sufficiently stable so that in fact prices move within moderate ranges. This is equally true in a system of floating exchange rates. The ultimate objective is a world in which exchange rates, while free to vary, are, in fact, highly stable because basic economic policies and conditions are stable.</q>\n\nAdvocates of floating exchange rates admit that, yes, exchange rates may sometimes fluctuate. They point out, however, that if a central bank focuses on preventing either high inflation or deep recession, with low and reasonably steady interest rates, then exchange rates will have less reason to vary.\n\n### Using Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs\n\nWhen a government intervenes in the foreign exchange market so that the exchange rate of its currency is different from what the market would have produced, it is said to have established a \u201cpeg\u201d for its currency. A **soft peg**{: data-type=\"term\"} is the name for an exchange rate policy where the government usually allows the exchange rate to be set by the market, but in some cases, especially if the exchange rate seems to be moving rapidly in one direction, the central bank will intervene in the market. With a **hard peg**{: data-type=\"term\"} exchange rate policy, the central bank sets a fixed and unchanging value for the exchange rate. A central bank can implement soft peg and hard peg policies.\n\nSuppose the market exchange rate for the Brazilian currency, the real, would be 35 cents/real with a daily quantity of 15 billion real traded in the market, as shown at the equilibrium E<sub>0</sub> in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_024) (a) and [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_024) (b). However, the government of Brazil decides that the exchange rate should be 30 cents/real, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_024) (a). Perhaps Brazil sets this lower exchange rate to benefit its export industries. Perhaps it is an attempt to stimulate aggregate demand by stimulating exports. Perhaps Brazil believes that the current market exchange rate is higher than the long-term purchasing power parity value of the real, so it is minimizing fluctuations in the real by keeping it at this lower rate. Perhaps the target exchange rate was set sometime in the past, and is now being maintained for the sake of stability. Whatever the reason, if Brazil\u2019s central bank wishes to keep the exchange rate below the market level, it must face the reality that at this weaker exchange rate of 30 cents/real, the quantity demanded of its currency at 17 billion reals is greater than the quantity supplied of 13 billion reals in the foreign exchange market.\n\n  If an exchange rate is pegged below what would otherwise be the equilibrium, then the quantity demanded of the currency will exceed the quantity supplied. (b) If an exchange rate is pegged above what would otherwise be the equilibrium, then the quantity supplied of the currency exceeds the quantity demanded.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C29_024 data-title=\"Pegging an Exchange Rate \"}\n\nThe Brazilian central bank could weaken its exchange rate in two ways. One approach is to use an **expansionary monetary policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} that leads to lower interest rates. In foreign exchange markets, the lower interest rates will reduce demand and increase supply of the real and lead to depreciation. This technique is not often used because lowering interest rates to weaken the currency may be in conflict with the country\u2019s monetary policy goals. Alternatively, Brazil\u2019s central bank could trade directly in the foreign exchange market. The central bank can expand the money supply by creating reals, use the reals to purchase foreign currencies, and avoid selling any of its own currency. In this way, it can fill the gap between **quantity demanded**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **quantity supplied**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of its currency.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C29_024) (b) shows the opposite situation. Here, the Brazilian government desires a stronger exchange rate of 40 cents/real than the market rate of 35 cents/real. Perhaps Brazil desires the stronger currency to reduce aggregate demand and to fight inflation, or perhaps Brazil believes that that current market exchange rate is temporarily lower than the long-term rate. Whatever the reason, at the higher desired exchange rate, the quantity supplied of 16 billion reals exceeds the quantity demanded of 14 billion reals.\n\nBrazil\u2019s central bank can use a **contractionary monetary policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} to raise interest rates, which will increase demand and reduce supply of the currency on foreign exchange markets, and lead to an appreciation. Alternatively, Brazil\u2019s central bank can trade directly in the foreign exchange market. In this case, with an excess supply of its own currency in foreign exchange markets, the central bank must use reserves of foreign currency, like U.S. dollars, to demand its own currency and thus cause an appreciation of its exchange rate.\n\nBoth a soft peg and a hard peg policy require that the central bank intervene in the foreign exchange market. However, a hard peg policy attempts to preserve a fixed exchange rate at all times. A soft peg policy typically allows the exchange rate to move up and down by relatively small amounts in the short run of several months or a year, and to move by larger amounts over time, but seeks to avoid extreme short-term fluctuations.\n\n### Tradeoffs of Soft Pegs and Hard Pegs\n\nWhen a country decides to alter the market exchange rate, it faces a number of tradeoffs. If it uses **monetary policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} to alter the exchange rate, it then cannot at the same time use monetary policy to address issues of inflation or recession. If it uses direct purchases and sales of foreign currencies in exchange rates, then it must face the issue of how it will handle its reserves of foreign currency. Finally, a pegged exchange rate can even create additional movements of the exchange rate; for example, even the possibility of government intervention in exchange rate markets will lead to rumors about whether and when the government will intervene, and dealers in the foreign exchange market will react to those rumors. Let\u2019s consider these issues in turn.\n\nOne concern with pegged exchange rate policies is that they imply a country\u2019s monetary policy is no longer focused on controlling inflation or shortening recessions, but now must also take the exchange rate into account. For example, when a country pegs its exchange rate, it will sometimes face economic situations where it would like to have an expansionary monetary policy to fight recession\u2014but it cannot do so because that policy would depreciate its exchange rate and break its hard peg. With a soft peg exchange rate policy, the **central bank**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} can sometimes ignore the exchange rate and focus on domestic inflation or recession\u2014but in other cases the central bank may ignore inflation or recession and instead focus on its soft peg exchange rate. With a hard peg policy, domestic monetary policy is effectively no longer determined by domestic inflation or unemployment, but only by what monetary policy is needed to keep the exchange rate at the hard peg.\n\nAnother issue arises when a central bank intervenes directly in the exchange rate market. If a central bank ends up in a situation where it is perpetually creating and selling its own currency on foreign exchange markets, it will be buying the currency of other countries, like U.S. dollars or euros, to hold as **reserves**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Holding large reserves of other currencies has an **opportunity cost**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, and central banks will not wish to boost such reserves without limit.\n\nIn addition, a central bank that causes a large increase in the supply of money is also risking an inflationary surge in aggregate demand. Conversely, when a central bank wishes to buy its own currency, it can do so by using its reserves of international currency like the U.S. dollar or the euro. But if the central bank runs out of such reserves, it can no longer use this method to strengthen its currency. Thus, buying foreign currencies in exchange rate markets can be expensive and inflationary, while selling foreign currencies can work only until a central bank runs out of reserves.\n\nYet another issue is that when a government pegs its exchange rate, it may unintentionally create another reason for additional fluctuation. With a soft peg policy, foreign exchange dealers and international investors react to every rumor about how or when the central bank is likely to intervene to influence the exchange rate, and as they react to rumors the exchange rate will shift up and down. Thus, even though the goal of a soft peg policy is to reduce short-term fluctuations of the exchange rate, the existence of the policy\u2014when anticipated in the foreign exchange market\u2014may sometimes increase short-term fluctuations as international investors try to anticipate how and when the central bank will act. The following Clear It Up feature discusses the effects of **international capital flows**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014capital that flows across national boundaries as either portfolio investment or direct investment.\n\n\n\nHow do Tobin taxes control the flow of capital?\n\nSome countries like Chile and Malaysia have sought to reduce movements in exchange rates by limiting inflows and outflows of international financial capital. This policy can be enacted either through targeted taxes or by regulations.\n\nTaxes on international capital flows are sometimes known as **Tobin taxes**{: data-type=\"term\"}, named after **James Tobin**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the 1981 Nobel laureate in economics who proposed such a tax in a 1972 lecture. For example, a government might tax all foreign exchange transactions, or attempt to tax short-term **portfolio investment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} while exempting long-term foreign **direct investment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Countries can also use regulation to forbid certain kinds of foreign investment in the first place or to make it difficult for international financial investors to withdraw their funds from a country.\n\nThe goal of such policies is to reduce international capital flows, especially short-term portfolio flows, in the hope that doing so will reduce the chance of large movements in exchange rates that can bring macroeconomic disaster.\n\nBut proposals to limit **international financial flows**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} have severe practical difficulties. Taxes are imposed by national governments, not international ones. If one government imposes a Tobin tax on exchange rate transactions carried out within its territory, the exchange rate market might easily be operated by a firm based someplace like the Grand Caymans, an island nation in the Caribbean well-known for allowing some financial wheeling and dealing. In an interconnected global economy, if goods and services are allowed to flow across national borders, then payments need to flow across borders, too. It is very difficult\u2014in fact close to impossible\u2014for a nation to allow only the flows of payments that relate to goods and services, while clamping down or taxing other flows of financial capital. If a nation participates in international trade, it must also participate in international capital movements.\n\nFinally, countries all over the world, especially low-income countries, are crying out for foreign investment to help develop their economies. Policies that discourage international financial investment may prevent some possible harm, but they rule out potentially substantial economic benefits as well.\n\n\n\nA hard peg exchange rate policy will not allow short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate. If the government first announces a hard peg and then later changes its mind\u2014perhaps the government becomes unwilling to keep interest rates high or to hold high levels of foreign exchange reserves\u2014then the result of abandoning a hard peg could be a dramatic shift in the exchange rate.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, about one-third of the countries in the world used a soft peg approach and about one-quarter used a hard peg approach. The general trend in the 1990s was to shift away from a soft peg approach in favor of either floating rates or a hard peg. The concern is that a successful soft peg policy may, for a time, lead to very little variation in exchange rates, so that firms and banks in the economy begin to act as if a hard peg exists. When the exchange rate does move, the effects are especially painful because firms and banks have not planned and hedged against a possible change. Thus, the argument went, it is better either to be clear that the exchange rate is always flexible, or that it is fixed, but choosing an in-between soft peg option may end up being worst of all.\n\n### A Merged Currency\n\nA final approach to exchange rate policy is for a nation to choose a common currency shared with one or more nations is also called a **merged currency**{: data-type=\"term\"}. A merged currency approach eliminates foreign exchange risk altogether. Just as no one worries about exchange rate movements when buying and selling between New York and California, Europeans know that the value of the euro will be the same in Germany and France and other European nations that have adopted the euro.\n\nHowever, a merged currency also poses problems. Like a hard peg, a merged currency means that a nation has given up altogether on domestic monetary policy, and instead has put its interest rate policies in other hands. When Ecuador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, it has no voice in whether the Federal Reserve raises or lowers interest rates. The European Central Bank that determines monetary policy for the euro has representatives from all the euro nations. However, from the standpoint of, say, Portugal, there will be times when the decisions of the European Central Bank about monetary policy do not match the decisions that would have been made by a Portuguese central bank.\n\nThe lines between these four different exchange rate policies can blend into each other. For example, a soft peg exchange rate policy in which the government almost never acts to intervene in the exchange rate market will look a great deal like a floating exchange rate. Conversely, a soft peg policy in which the government intervenes often to keep the exchange rate near a specific level will look a lot like a hard peg. A decision to merge currencies with another country is, in effect, a decision to have a permanently fixed exchange rate with those countries, which is like a very hard exchange rate peg. The range of exchange rates policy choices, with their advantages and disadvantages, are summarized in [\\[link\\]](#Table_29_03).\n\n<table id=\"Table_29_03\" summary=\"This table has five columns and six rows.

The exchange rates between different currencies complicate the picture. If exchange rates are set solely by financial markets, they fluctuate substantially as short-term portfolio investors try to anticipate tomorrow\u2019s news. If the government attempts to intervene in exchange rate markets through soft pegs or hard pegs, it gives up at least some of the power to use monetary policy to focus on domestic inflations and recessions, and it risks causing even greater fluctuations in foreign exchange markets.\n\nThere is no consensus among economists about which exchange rate policies are best: floating, soft peg, hard peg, or merged currencies. The choice depends both on how well a nation\u2019s central bank can implement a specific exchange rate policy and on how well a nation\u2019s firms and banks can adapt to different exchange rate policies. A national economy that does a fairly good job at achieving the four main economic goals of growth, low inflation, low unemployment, and a sustainable **balance of trade**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} will probably do just fine most of the time with any exchange rate policy; conversely, no exchange rate policy is likely to save an economy that consistently fails at achieving these goals. On the other hand, a merged currency applied across wide geographic and cultural areas carries with it its own set of problems, such as the ability for countries to conduct their own independent monetary policies.\n\n\n\nIs a Stronger Dollar Good for the U.S. Economy?\n\nThe foreign exchange value of the dollar is a price and whether a higher price is good or bad depends on where you are standing: sellers benefit from higher prices and buyers are harmed. A stronger dollar is good for U.S. imports (and people working for U.S. importers) and U.S. investment abroad. It is also good for U.S. tourists going to other countries, since their dollar goes further. But a stronger dollar is bad for U.S. exports (and people working in U.S. export industries); it is bad for foreign investment in the United States (leading, for example, to higher U.S. interest rates); and it is bad for foreign tourists (as well as U.S hotels, restaurants, and others in the tourist industry). In short, whether the U.S. dollar is good or bad is a more complex question than you may have thought. The economic answer is \u201cit depends.\u201d\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nIn a floating exchange rate policy, a country\u2019s exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. In a soft peg exchange rate policy, a country\u2019s exchange rate is usually determined in the foreign exchange market, but the government sometimes intervenes to strengthen or weaken the exchange rate. In a hard peg exchange rate policy, the government chooses an exchange rate. A central bank can intervene in exchange markets in two ways. It can raise or lower interest rates to make the currency stronger or weaker. Or it can directly purchase or sell its currency in foreign exchange markets. All exchange rates policies face tradeoffs. A hard peg exchange rate policy will reduce exchange rate fluctuations, but means that a country must focus its monetary policy on the exchange rate, not on fighting recession or controlling inflation. When a nation merges its currency with another nation, it gives up on nationally oriented monetary policy altogether.\n\nA soft peg exchange rate may create additional volatility as exchange rate markets try to anticipate when and how the government will intervene. A flexible exchange rate policy allows monetary policy to focus on inflation and unemployment, and allows the exchange rate to change with inflation and rates of return, but also raises a risk that exchange rates may sometimes make large and abrupt movements. The spectrum of exchange rate policies includes: (a) a floating exchange rate, (b) a pegged exchange rate, soft or hard, and (c) a merged currency. Monetary policy can focus on a variety of goals: (a) inflation; (b) inflation or unemployment, depending on which is the most dangerous obstacle; and (c) a long-term rule based policy designed to keep the money supply stable and predictable.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nHow would a contractionary monetary policy affect the exchange rate, net exports, aggregate demand, and aggregate supply?\n\n\n\nA contractionary monetary policy, by driving up domestic interest rates, would cause the currency to appreciate. The higher value of the currency in foreign exchange markets would reduce exports, since from the perspective of foreign buyers, they are now more expensive. The higher value of the currency would similarly stimulate imports, since they would now be cheaper from the perspective of domestic buyers. Lower exports and higher imports cause net exports (EX \u2013 IM) to fall, which causes aggregate demand to fall. The result would be a decrease in GDP working through the exchange rate mechanism reinforcing the effect contractionary monetary policy has on domestic investment expenditure. However, cheaper imports would stimulate aggregate supply, bringing GDP back to potential, though at a lower price level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA central bank can allow its currency to fall indefinitely, but it cannot allow its currency to rise indefinitely. Why not?\n\n\n\nFor a currency to fall, a central bank need only supply more of its currency in foreign exchange markets. It can print as much domestic currency as it likes. For a currency to rise, a central bank needs to buy its currency in foreign exchange markets, paying with foreign currency. Since no central bank has an infinite amount of foreign currency reserves, it cannot buy its currency indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs a country for which imports and exports make up a large fraction of the GDP more likely to adopt a flexible exchange rate or a fixed (hard peg) exchange rate?\n\n\n\nVariations in exchange rates, because they change import and export prices, disturb international trade flows. When trade is a large part of a nation\u2019s economic activity, government will find it more advantageous to fix exchange rates to minimize disruptions of trade flows.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a floating exchange rate, a soft peg, a hard peg, and dollarization?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList some advantages and disadvantages of the different exchange rate policies.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nMany developing countries, like Mexico, have moderate to high rates of inflation.

Closed! Why?\n\nFor two weeks in October 2013, the U.S. federal government shut down. Many federal services, like the national parks, closed and 800,000 federal employees were furloughed. Tourists were shocked and so was the rest of the world: Congress and the President could not agree on a budget. Inside the Capitol, Republicans and Democrats argued about spending priorities and whether to increase the national debt limit. Each year\\'s budget, which is over $3 trillion of spending, must be approved by Congress and signed by the President. Two thirds of the budget is entitlements and other mandatory spending which occur without congressional or presidential action once the programs are set up. Tied to the budget debate was the issue of increasing the debt ceiling\u2014how high the national debt of the U.S. government can be. The House of Representatives refused to sign on to the bills to fund the government unless they included provisions to stop or change the Affordable Health Care Act (more colloquially known as Obamacare). As the days ticked by, the United States came very close to defaulting on its debt.\n\nWhy does the federal budget create such intense debates? What would happen if the United States actually defaulted on its debt? In this chapter, we will examine the federal budget, taxation, and fiscal policy. We will also look at the annual federal budget deficits and the national debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Government Spending\n* Taxation\n* Federal Deficits and the National Debt\n* Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recessions, Unemployment, and Inflation\n* Automatic Stabilizers\n* Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy\n* The Question of a Balanced Budget\n\n\n\nAll levels of government\u2014federal, state, and local\u2014have budgets that show how much revenue the government expects to receive in taxes and other income and how the government plans to spend it. Budgets, however, can shift dramatically within a few years, as policy decisions and unexpected events shake up earlier tax and spending plans.\n\nIn this chapter, we revisit **fiscal policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which was first covered in [Welcome to Economics!](/m48590){: .target-chapter} Fiscal policy is one of two policy tools for fine tuning the economy (the other is monetary policy). While **monetary policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is made by policymakers at the Federal Reserve, fiscal policy is made by Congress and the President.\n\nThe discussion of fiscal policy focuses on how federal government taxing and spending affects aggregate demand. All government spending and taxes affect the economy, but fiscal policy focuses strictly on the policies of the federal government. We begin with an overview of U.S. government spending and taxes. We then discuss fiscal policy from a short-run perspective; that is, how government uses tax and spending policies to address recession, unemployment, and inflation; how periods of recession and growth affect government budgets; and the merits of balanced budget proposals.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

When the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year, it runs a **budget deficit**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Conversely, when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year, it runs a **budget surplus**{: data-type=\"term\"}. If government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a **balanced budget**{: data-type=\"term\"}. For example, in 2009, the U.S. government experienced its largest budget deficit ever, as the federal government spent $1.4 trillion more than it collected in taxes. This deficit was about 10% of the size of the U.S. GDP in 2009, making it by far the largest budget deficit relative to GDP since the mammoth borrowing used to finance World War II.\n\nThis section presents an overview of government spending in the United States.\n\n### Total U.S. Government Spending\n\nFederal spending in nominal dollars (that is, dollars not adjusted for inflation) has grown by a multiple of more than 38 over the last four decades, from $93.4 billion in 1960 to $3.9 trillion in 2014. Comparing spending over time in nominal dollars is misleading because it does not take into account inflation or growth in population and the real economy. A more useful method of comparison is to examine government spending as a percent of GDP over time.\n\nThe top line in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_001) shows the level of federal spending since 1960, expressed as a share of GDP. Despite a widespread sense among many Americans that the federal government has been growing steadily larger, the graph shows that federal spending has hovered in a range from 18% to 22% of GDP most of the time since 1960. The other lines in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_001) show the major federal spending categories: national defense, Social Security, health programs, and interest payments. From the graph, we see that national defense spending as a share of GDP has generally declined since the 1960s, although there were some upward bumps in the 1980s buildup under President Ronald Reagan and in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. In contrast, Social Security and healthcare have grown steadily as a percent of GDP. Healthcare expenditures include both payments for senior citizens (Medicare), and payments for low-income Americans (Medicaid). Medicaid is also partially funded by state governments. Interest payments are the final main category of government spending shown in the figure.\n\n  has increased. (Source: Economic Report of the President, Tables B-2 and B-22, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2014/content-detail.html)\"){: #CNX_Econ_C30_001 data-title=\"Federal Spending, 1960&#x2013;2014\"}\n\nEach year, the government borrows funds from U.S. citizens and foreigners to cover its budget deficits. It does this by selling securities (Treasury bonds, notes, and bills)\u2014in essence borrowing from the public and promising to repay with interest in the future. From 1961 to 1997, the U.S. government has run budget deficits, and thus borrowed funds, in almost every year. It had budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, and then returned to deficits.\n\nThe interest payments on past federal government borrowing were typically 1\u20132% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s but then climbed above 3% of GDP in the 1980s and stayed there until the late 1990s. The government was able to repay some of its past borrowing by running surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and, with help from low interest rates, the interest payments on past federal government borrowing had fallen back to 1.4% of GDP by 2012.\n\nWe investigate the patterns of government borrowing and debt in more detail later in this chapter, but first we need to clarify the difference between the deficit and the debt. *The deficit is not the debt*. The difference between the deficit and the debt lies in the time frame. The government deficit (or surplus) refers to what happens with the federal government budget each year. The government debt is accumulated over time; it is the sum of all past deficits and surpluses. If you borrow $10,000 per year for each of the four years of college, you might say that your annual deficit was $10,000, but your accumulated debt over the four years is $40,000.\n\nThese four categories\u2014national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments\u2014account for roughly 73% of all federal spending, as [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_002) shows. The remaining 27% wedge of the pie chart covers all other categories of federal government spending: international affairs; science and technology; natural resources and the environment; transportation; housing; education; income support for the poor; community and regional development; law enforcement and the judicial system; and the administrative costs of running the government.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C30_002 data-title=\"Slices of Federal Spending, 2014\"}\n\n### State and Local Government Spending\n\nAlthough federal government spending often gets most of the media attention, state and local government spending is also substantial\u2014at about $3.1 trillion in 2014. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_003) shows that state and local government spending has increased during the last four decades from around 8% to around 14% today. The single biggest item is education, which accounts for about one-third of the total. The rest covers programs like highways, libraries, hospitals and healthcare, parks, and police and fire protection. Unlike the federal government, all states (except Vermont) have balanced budget laws, which means any gaps between revenues and spending must be closed by higher taxes, lower spending, drawing down their previous savings, or some combination of all of these.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C30_003 data-title=\"State and Local Spending, 1960&#x2013;2013\"}\n\nU.S. presidential candidates often run for office pledging to improve the public schools or to get tough on crime. However, in the U.S. system of government, these tasks are primarily the responsibilities of state and local governments. Indeed, in fiscal year 2014 state and local governments spent about $840 billion per year on education (including K\u201312 and college and university education), compared to only $100 billion by the federal government, according to usgovernmentspending.com. In other words, about 90 cents of every dollar spent on education happens at the state and local level. A politician who really wants hands-on responsibility for reforming education or reducing crime might do better to run for mayor of a large city or for state governor rather than for president of the United States.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nFiscal policy is the set of policies that relate to federal government spending, taxation, and borrowing. In recent decades, the level of federal government spending and taxes, expressed as a share of GDP, has not changed much, typically fluctuating between about 18% to 22% of GDP. However, the level of state spending and taxes, as a share of GDP, has risen from about 12\u201313% to about 20% of GDP over the last four decades. The four main areas of federal spending are national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments, which together account for about 70% of all federal spending. When a government spends more than it collects in taxes, it is said to have a budget deficit. When a government collects more in taxes than it spends, it is said to have a budget surplus. If government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a balanced budget. The sum of all past deficits and surpluses make up the government debt.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhen governments run budget deficits, how do they make up the differences between tax revenue and spending?\n\n\n\nThe government borrows funds by selling Treasury bonds, notes, and bills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen governments run budget surpluses, what is done with the extra funds?\n\n\n\nThe funds can be used to pay down the national debt or else be refunded to the taxpayers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible for a nation to run budget deficits and still have its debt/GDP ratio fall? Explain your answer. Is it possible for a nation to run budget surpluses and still have its debt/GDP ratio rise? Explain your answer.\n\n\n\nYes, a nation can run budget deficits and see its debt/GDP ratio fall. In fact, this is not uncommon. If the deficit is small in a given year, than the addition to debt in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio will be relatively small, while the growth in GDP is larger, and so the debt/GDP ratio declines. This was the experience of the U.S. economy for the period from the end of World War II to about 1980. It is also theoretically possible, although not likely, for a nation to have a budget surplus and see its debt/GDP ratio rise. Imagine the case of a nation with a small surplus, but in a recession year when the economy shrinks. It is possible that the decline in the nation\u2019s debt, in the numerator of the debt/GDP ratio, would be proportionally less than the fall in the size of GDP, so the debt/GDP ratio would rise.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nGive some examples of changes in federal spending and taxes by the government that would be fiscal policy and some that would not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave the spending and taxes of the U.S. federal government generally had an upward or a downward trend in the last few decades?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the main categories of U.S. federal government spending?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a budget deficit, a balanced budget, and a budget surplus?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave spending and taxes by state and local governments in the United States had a generally upward or downward trend in the last few decades?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhy is government spending typically measured as a percentage of GDP rather than in nominal dollars?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are expenditures such as crime prevention and education typically done at the state and local level rather than at the federal level?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is spending by the U.S. government on scientific research at NASA fiscal policy while spending by the University of Illinois is not fiscal policy? Why is a cut in the payroll tax fiscal policy whereas a cut in a state income tax is not fiscal policy?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nA government starts off with a total debt of $3.5 billion. In year one, the government runs a deficit of $400 million. In year two, the government runs a deficit of $1 billion. In year three, the government runs a surplus of $200 million. What is the total debt of the government at the end of year three?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nKramer, Mattea, et. al. <em>A People\\'s Guide to the Federal Budget. </em> National Priorities Project.

What percentage is collected and what that revenue is used for varies greatly. The following sections will briefly explain the taxation system in the United States.\n\n### Federal Taxes\n\nJust as many Americans erroneously think that federal spending has grown considerably, many also believe that taxes have increased substantially. The top line of [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_004) shows total federal taxes as a share of GDP since 1960. Although the line rises and falls, it typically remains within the range of 17% to 20% of GDP, except for 2009, when taxes fell substantially below this level, due to recession.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C30_004 data-title=\"Federal Taxes, 1960&#x2013;2014\"}\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_004) also shows the patterns of taxation for the main categories of taxes levied by the federal government: individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, and social insurance and retirement receipts. When most people think of taxes levied by the federal government, the first tax that comes to mind is the **individual income tax**{: data-type=\"term\"} that is due every year on April 15 (or the first business day after). The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue, but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue.\n\nThe second largest source of federal revenue is the **payroll tax**{: data-type=\"term\"} (captured in social insurance and retirement receipts), which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare. Payroll taxes have increased steadily over time. Together, the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about 80% of federal tax revenues in 2014. Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax, nearly three-quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes.\n\nThe income tax is a **progressive tax**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which means that the tax rates increase as a household\u2019s income increases. Taxes also vary with marital status, family size, and other factors. The **marginal tax rates**{: data-type=\"term\"} (the tax that must be paid on all yearly income) for a single taxpayer range from 10% to 35%, depending on income, as the following Clear It Up feature explains.\n\n\n\nHow does the marginal rate work?\n\nSuppose that a single taxpayer\u2019s income is $35,000 per year. Also suppose that income from $0 to $9,075 is taxed at 10%, income from $9,075 to $36,900 is taxed at 15%, and, finally, income from $36,900 and beyond is taxed at 25%. Since this person earns $35,000, their marginal tax rate is 15%.\n\n\n\nThe key fact here is that the federal income tax is designed so that tax rates increase as income increases, up to a certain level. The payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare are designed in a different way. First, the payroll taxes for Social Security are imposed at a rate of 12.4% up to a certain wage limit, set at $118,500 in 2015. Medicare, on the other hand, pays for elderly healthcare, and is fixed at 2.9%, with no upper ceiling.\n\nIn both cases, the employer and the employee split the payroll taxes. An employee only sees 6.2% deducted from his paycheck for Social Security, and 1.45% from Medicare. However, as economists are quick to point out, the employer\u2019s half of the taxes are probably passed along to the employees in the form of lower wages, so in reality, the worker pays all of the payroll taxes.\n\nThe Medicare payroll tax is also called a **proportional tax**{: data-type=\"term\"}; that is, a flat percentage of all wages earned. The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit, but above that level it becomes a **regressive tax**{: data-type=\"term\"}, meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax.\n\nThe third-largest source of federal tax revenue, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_004) is the **corporate income tax**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The common name for corporate income is \u201cprofits.\u201d Over time, corporate income tax receipts have declined as a share of GDP, from about 4% in the 1960s to an average of 1% to 2% of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s.\n\nThe federal government has a few other, smaller sources of revenue. It imposes an **excise tax**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014that is, a tax on a particular good\u2014on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol. As a share of GDP, the amount collected by these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time, from about 2% of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3% by 2014, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The government also imposes an **estate and gift tax**{: data-type=\"term\"} on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation\u2014either after death or during life in the form of gifts. These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2% of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s. By a quirk of legislation, the estate and gift tax was repealed in 2010, but reinstated in 2011. Other federal taxes, which are also relatively small in magnitude, include tariffs collected on imported goods and charges for inspections of goods entering the country.\n\n### State and Local Taxes\n\nAt the state and local level, taxes have been rising as a share of GDP over the last few decades to match the gradual rise in spending, as [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_005) illustrates. The main revenue sources for state and local governments are sales taxes, property taxes, and revenue passed along from the federal government, but many state and local governments also levy personal and corporate income taxes, as well as impose a wide variety of fees and charges. The specific sources of tax revenue vary widely across state and local governments. Some states rely more on property taxes, some on sales taxes, some on income taxes, and some more on revenues from the federal government.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C30_005 data-title=\"State and Local Tax Revenue as a Share of GDP, 1960&#x2013;2014 \"}\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe two main federal taxes are individual income taxes and payroll taxes that provide funds for Social Security and Medicare; these taxes together account for more than 80% of federal revenues. Other federal taxes include the corporate income tax, excise taxes on alcohol, gasoline and tobacco, and the estate and gift tax. A progressive tax is one, like the federal income tax, where those with higher incomes pay a higher share of taxes out of their income than those with lower incomes. A proportional tax is one, like the payroll tax for Medicare, where everyone pays the same share of taxes regardless of income level. A regressive tax is one, like the payroll tax (above a certain threshold) that supports Social Security, where those with high income pay a lower share of income in taxes than those with lower incomes.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nSuppose that gifts were taxed at a rate of 10% for amounts up to $100,000 and 20% for anything over that amount. Would this tax be regressive or progressive?\n\n\n\nProgressive. People who give larger gifts subject to the higher tax rate would typically have larger incomes as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an individual owns a corporation for which he is the only employee, which different types of federal tax will he have to pay?\n\n\n\nCorporate income tax on his profits, individual income tax on his salary, and payroll tax taken out of the wages he pays himself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat taxes would an individual pay if he were self-employed and the business is not incorporated?\n\n\n\nindividual income taxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe social security tax is 6.2% on employees\u2019 income earned below $113,000. Is this tax progressive, regressive or proportional?\n\n\n\nThe tax is regressive because wealthy income earners are not taxed at all on income above $113,000. As a percent of total income, the social security tax hits lower income earners harder than wealthier individuals.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are the main categories of U.S. federal government taxes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a progressive tax, a proportional tax, and a regressive tax?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nExcise taxes on tobacco and alcohol and state sales taxes are often criticized for being regressive. Although everyone pays the same rate regardless of income, why might this be so?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the benefit of having state and local taxes on income instead of collecting all such taxes at the federal level?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nBurman, Leonard E., and Joel Selmrod. *Taxes in America: What Everyone Needs to Know*.

Deficits were also large during the 1930s, the 1980s, the early 1990s, and most recently during the recession of 2008\u20132009.\n\n . http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FYFSGDA188S) \"){: #CNX_Econ_C30_006 data-title=\"Pattern of Federal Budget Deficits and Surpluses, 1929&#x2013;2014 \"}\n\n### Debt/GDP Ratio\n\nAnother useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual deficits. The **national debt**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time; in contrast, the budget deficit refers to how much has been borrowed in one particular year. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_007) shows the ratio of debt/GDP since 1940. Until the 1970s, the debt/GDP ratio revealed a fairly clear pattern of federal borrowing. The government ran up large deficits and raised the debt/GDP ratio in World War II, but from the 1950s to the 1970s the government ran either surpluses or relatively small deficits, and so the debt/GDP ratio drifted down. Large deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s caused the ratio to rise sharply. When budget surpluses arrived from 1998 to 2001, the debt/GDP ratio declined substantially. The budget deficits starting in 2002 then tugged the debt/GDP ratio higher\u2014with a big jump when the recession took hold in 2008\u20132009.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C30_007 data-title=\"Federal Debt as a Percentage of GDP, 1942&#x2013;2014\"}\n\nThe next Clear it Up feature discusses how the government handles the national debt.\n\n\n\nWhat is the national debt?\n\nOne year\u2019s federal budget deficit causes the federal government to sell Treasury bonds to make up the difference between spending programs and tax revenues. The dollar value of all the outstanding Treasury bonds on which the federal government owes money is equal to the national debt.\n\n\n\n### The Path from Deficits to Surpluses to Deficits\n\nWhy did the budget deficits suddenly turn to surpluses from 1998 to 2001? And why did the surpluses return to deficits in 2002? Why did the deficit become so large after 2007? [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_008) suggests some answers. The graph combines the earlier information on total federal spending and taxes in a single graph, but focuses on the federal budget since 1990.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C30_008 data-title=\"Total Government Spending and Taxes as a Share of GDP, 1990&#x2013;2014 \"}\n\nGovernment spending as a share of GDP declined steadily through the 1990s. The biggest single reason was that defense spending declined from 5.2% of GDP in 1990 to 3.0% in 2000, but interest payments by the federal government also fell by about 1.0% of GDP. However, federal tax collections increased substantially in the later 1990s, jumping from 18.1% of GDP in 1994 to 20.8% in 2000. Powerful economic growth in the late 1990s fueled the boom in taxes. Personal income taxes rise as income goes up; payroll taxes rise as jobs and payrolls go up; corporate income taxes rise as profits go up. At the same time, government spending on transfer payments such as unemployment benefits, foods stamps, and welfare declined with more people working.\n\nThis sharp increase in tax revenues and decrease in expenditures on transfer payments was largely unexpected even by experienced budget analysts, and so budget surpluses came as a surprise. But in the early 2000s, many of these factors started running in reverse. Tax revenues sagged, due largely to the recession that started in March 2001, which reduced revenues. A series of tax cuts was enacted by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush, starting in 2001. In addition, government spending swelled due to increases in defense, healthcare, education, Social Security, and support programs for those who were hurt by the recession and the slow growth that followed. Deficits returned. When the severe recession hit in late 2007, spending climbed and tax collections fell to historically unusual levels, resulting in enormous deficits.\n\nLonger-term forecasts of the U.S. budget, a decade or more into the future, predict enormous deficits. The higher deficits run during the recession of 2008\u20132009 have repercussions, and the demographics will be challenging. The primary reason is the \u201cbaby boom\u201d\u2014the exceptionally high birthrates that began in 1946, right after World War II, and lasted for about two decades. Starting in 2010, the front edge of the baby boom generation began to reach age 65, and in the next two decades, the proportion of Americans over the age of 65 will increase substantially. The current level of the payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare will fall well short of the projected expenses of these programs, as the following Clear It Up feature shows; thus, the forecast is for large budget deficits. A decision to collect more revenue to support these programs or to decrease benefit levels would alter this long-term forecast.\n\n\n\nWhat is the long-term budget outlook for Social Security and Medicare?\n\nIn 1946, just one American in 13 was over age 65. By 2000, it was one in eight. By 2030, one American in five will be over age 65. Two enormous U.S. federal programs focus on the elderly\u2014Social Security and Medicare. The growing numbers of elderly Americans will increase spending on these programs, as well as on Medicaid. The current payroll tax levied on workers, which supports all of Social Security and the hospitalization insurance part of Medicare, will not be enough to cover the expected costs. So, what are the options?\n\nLong-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office in 2009 are that Medicare and Social Security spending combined will rise from 8.3% of GDP in 2009 to about 13% by 2035 and about 20% in 2080. If this rise in spending occurs, without any corresponding rise in tax collections, then some mix of changes must occur: (1) taxes will need to be increased dramatically; (2) other spending will need to be cut dramatically; (3) the retirement age and/or age receiving Medicare benefits will need to increase, or (4) the federal government will need to run extremely large budget deficits.\n\nSome proposals suggest removing the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax, so that those with very high incomes would have to pay the tax on the entire amount of their wages. Other proposals suggest moving Social Security and Medicare from systems in which workers pay for retirees toward programs that set up accounts where workers save funds over their lifetimes and then draw out after retirement to pay for healthcare.\n\nThe United States is not alone in this problem. Indeed, providing the promised level of retirement and health benefits to a growing proportion of elderly with a falling proportion of workers is an even more severe problem in many European nations and in Japan. How to pay promised levels of benefits to the elderly will be a difficult public policy decision.\n\n\n\nIn the next module we shift to the use of fiscal policy to counteract business cycle fluctuations. In addition, we will explore proposals requiring a balanced budget\u2014that is, for government spending and taxes to be equal each year. [The Impacts of Government Borrowing](/m48800){: .target-chapter} will also cover how fiscal policy and government borrowing will affect national saving\u2014and thus affect economic growth and trade imbalances.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nFor most of the twentieth century, the U.S. government took on debt during wartime and then paid down that debt slowly in peacetime. However, it took on quite substantial debts in peacetime in the 1980s and early 1990s, before a brief period of budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, followed by a return to annual budget deficits since 2002, with very large deficits in the recession of 2008 and 2009. A budget deficit or budget surplus is measured annually. Total government debt or national debt is the sum of budget deficits and budget surpluses over time.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nDebt has a certain self-reinforcing quality to it. There is one category of government spending that automatically increases along with the federal debt. What is it?\n\n\n\nAs debt increases, interest payments also rise, so that the deficit grows even if we keep other government spending constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue or False:\n\n1.  Federal spending has grown substantially in recent decades.\n2.  By world standards, the U.S. government controls a relatively large share of the U.S. economy.\n3.  A majority of the federal government\u2019s revenue is collected through personal income taxes.\n4.  Education spending is slightly larger at the federal level than at the state and local level.\n5.  State and local government spending has not risen much in recent decades.\n6.  Defense spending is higher now than ever.\n7.  The share of the economy going to federal taxes has increased substantially over time.\n8.  Foreign aid is a large portion, although less than half, of federal spending.\n9.  Federal deficits have been very large for the last two decades.\n10. The accumulated federal debt as a share of GDP is near an all-time high.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n1.

Fiscal policy does not include all spending (such as the increase in spending that accompanies a war).\n\nGraphically, we see that fiscal policy, whether through change in spending or taxes, shifts the **aggregate demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} outward in the case of **expansionary fiscal policy**{: data-type=\"term\"} and inward in the case of **contractionary fiscal policy**{: data-type=\"term\"}. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_009) illustrates the process by using an aggregate demand/aggregate supply diagram in a growing economy. The original equilibrium occurs at E<sub>0</sub>, the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD<sub>0</sub> and aggregate supply curve SRAS<sub>0</sub>, at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90.\n\nOne year later, **aggregate supply**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} has shifted to the right to SRAS<sub>1</sub> in the process of long-term economic growth, and aggregate demand has also shifted to the right to AD<sub>1</sub>, keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) is an output level of 206 and a price level of 92. One more year later, aggregate supply has again shifted to the right, now to SRAS<sub>2</sub>, and aggregate demand shifts right as well to AD<sub>2</sub>. Now the equilibrium is E<sub>2</sub>, with an output level of 212 and a price level of 94. In short, the figure shows an economy that is growing steadily year to year, producing at its potential GDP each year, with only small inflationary increases in the price level.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C30_009 data-title=\"A Healthy, Growing Economy \"}\n\nAggregate demand and aggregate supply do not always move neatly together. Aggregate demand may fail to increase along with aggregate supply, or aggregate demand may even shift left, for a number of possible reasons: households become hesitant about consuming; firms decide against investing as much; or perhaps the demand from other countries for exports diminishes. For example, investment by private firms in physical capital in the U.S. economy boomed during the late 1990s, rising from 14.1% of GDP in 1993 to 17.2% in 2000, before falling back to 15.2% by 2002. Conversely, if shifts in aggregate demand run ahead of increases in aggregate supply, inflationary increases in the price level will result. Business cycles of recession and recovery are the consequence of shifts in aggregate supply and aggregate demand.\n\n[Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation](/m48768){: .target-chapter} shows us that a central bank can use its powers over the banking system to engage in countercyclical\u2014or \u201cagainst the business cycle\u201d\u2014actions. If recession threatens, the central bank uses an expansionary monetary policy to increase the supply of money, increase the quantity of loans, reduce interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to the right. If inflation threatens, the central bank uses contractionary monetary policy to reduce the supply of money, reduce the quantity of loans, raise interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to the left. Fiscal policy is another macroeconomic policy tool for adjusting aggregate demand by using either government spending or taxation policy.\n\n### Expansionary Fiscal Policy\n\nExpansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, through either increases in government spending or reductions in taxes. Expansionary policy can do this by (1) increasing consumption by raising disposable income through cuts in personal income taxes or payroll taxes; (2) increasing investments by raising after-tax profits through cuts in business taxes; and (3) increasing government purchases through increased spending by the federal government on final goods and services and raising federal grants to state and local governments to increase their expenditures on final goods and services. Contractionary fiscal policy does the reverse: it decreases the level of aggregate demand by decreasing consumption, decreasing investments, and decreasing government spending, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. The aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is useful in judging whether expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy is appropriate.\n\nConsider first the situation in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_010), which is similar to the U.S. economy during the recession in 2008\u20132009. The intersection of aggregate demand (AD<sub>0</sub>) and aggregate supply (SRAS<sub>0</sub>) is occurring below the level of potential GDP as indicated by the LRAS curve. At the equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>), a recession occurs and unemployment rises. In this case, expansionary fiscal policy using tax cuts or increases in government spending can shift aggregate demand to AD<sub>1</sub>, closer to the full-employment level of output. In addition, the price level would rise back to the level P<sub>1</sub> associated with potential GDP.\n\n represents a recession, occurring at a quantity of output (Y0) below potential GDP. However, a shift of aggregate demand from AD0 to AD1, enacted through an expansionary fiscal policy, can move the economy to a new equilibrium output of E1 at the level of potential GDP which is shown by the LRAS curve. Since the economy was originally producing below potential GDP, any inflationary increase in the price level from P0 to P1 that results should be relatively small.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C30_010 data-title=\"Expansionary Fiscal Policy \"}\n\nShould the government use tax cuts or spending increases, or a mix of the two, to carry out expansionary fiscal policy? After the Great Recession of 2008\u20132009 (which started, actually, in very late 2007), U.S. government spending rose from 19.6% of GDP in 2007 to 24.6% in 2009, while tax revenues declined from 18.5% of GDP in 2007 to 14.8% in 2009. The choice between whether to use tax or spending tools often has a political tinge. As a general statement, conservatives and Republicans prefer to see expansionary fiscal policy carried out by tax cuts, while liberals and Democrats prefer that expansionary fiscal policy be implemented through spending increases. The Obama administration and Congress passed an $830 billion expansionary policy in early 2009 involving both tax cuts and increases in government spending, according to the Congressional Budget Office. However, state and local governments, whose budgets were also hard hit by the recession, began cutting their spending\u2014a policy that offset federal expansionary policy.\n\nThe conflict over which policy tool to use can be frustrating to those who want to categorize economics as \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cconservative,\u201d or who want to use economic models to argue against their political opponents. But the AD\u2013AS model can be used both by advocates of smaller government, who seek to reduce taxes and government spending, and by advocates of bigger government, who seek to raise taxes and government spending. Economic studies of specific taxing and spending programs can help to inform decisions about whether taxes or spending should be changed, and in what ways. Ultimately, decisions about whether to use tax or spending mechanisms to implement macroeconomic policy is, in part, a political decision rather than a purely economic one.\n\n### Contractionary Fiscal Policy\n\nFiscal policy can also contribute to pushing aggregate demand beyond potential GDP in a way that leads to inflation. As shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_011), a very large budget deficit pushes up aggregate demand, so that the intersection of aggregate demand (AD<sub>0</sub>) and aggregate supply (SRAS<sub>0</sub>) occurs at equilibrium E<sub>0</sub>, which is an output level above potential GDP. This is sometimes known as an \u201coverheating economy\u201d where demand is so high that there is upward pressure on wages and prices, causing inflation. In this situation, contractionary fiscal policy involving federal spending cuts or tax increases can help to reduce the upward pressure on the price level by shifting aggregate demand to the left, to AD<sub>1</sub>, and causing the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> to be at potential GDP, where aggregate demand intersects the LRAS curve.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C30_011 data-title=\"A Contractionary Fiscal Policy \"}\n\nAgain, the AD\u2013AS model does not dictate how this contractionary fiscal policy is to be carried out. Some may prefer spending cuts; others may prefer tax increases; still others may say that it depends on the specific situation. The model only argues that, in this situation, aggregate demand needs to be reduced.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nExpansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, either through increases in government spending or through reductions in taxes. Expansionary fiscal policy is most appropriate when an economy is in recession and producing below its potential GDP. Contractionary fiscal policy decreases the level of aggregate demand, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. Contractionary fiscal policy is most appropriate when an economy is producing above its potential GDP.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the main reason for employing contractionary fiscal policy in a time of strong economic growth?\n\n\n\nTo keep prices from rising too much or too rapidly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the main reason for employing expansionary fiscal policy during a recession?\n\n\n\nTo increase employment.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between expansionary fiscal policy and contractionary fiscal policy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder what general macroeconomic circumstances might a government use expansionary fiscal policy?

Federal fiscal policies include **discretionary fiscal policy**{: data-type=\"term\"}, when the government passes a new law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels. The stimulus package of 2009 is an example. Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically, due to **automatic stabilizers**{: data-type=\"term\"}, such as unemployment insurance and food stamps, which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom.\n\n### Counterbalancing Recession and Boom\n\nConsider first the situation where aggregate demand has risen sharply, causing the equilibrium to occur at a level of output above potential GDP. This situation will increase inflationary pressure in the economy. The policy prescription in this setting would be a dose of contractionary fiscal policy, implemented through some combination of higher taxes and lower spending. To some extent, *both* changes happen automatically. On the tax side, a rise in aggregate demand means that workers and firms throughout the economy earn more. Because taxes are based on personal income and corporate profits, a rise in aggregate demand automatically increases tax payments. On the spending side, stronger aggregate demand typically means lower unemployment and fewer layoffs, and so there is less need for government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare, Medicaid, and other programs in the social safety net.\n\nThe process works in reverse, too. If aggregate demand were to fall sharply so that a recession occurs, then the prescription would be for expansionary fiscal policy\u2014some mix of tax cuts and spending increases. The lower level of aggregate demand and higher unemployment will tend to pull down personal incomes and corporate profits, an effect that will reduce the amount of taxes owed automatically. Higher unemployment and a weaker economy should lead to increased government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare, and other similar domestic programs. In 2009, the stimulus package included an extension in the time allowed to collect unemployment insurance. In addition, the automatic stabilizers react to a weakening of aggregate demand with expansionary fiscal policy and react to a strengthening of aggregate demand with contractionary fiscal policy, just as the AD/AS analysis suggests.\n\nThe very large budget deficit of 2009 was produced by a combination of automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal policy. The Great Recession, starting in late 2007, meant less tax-generating economic activity, which triggered the automatic stabilizers that reduce taxes. Most economists, even those who are concerned about a possible pattern of persistently large budget deficits, are much less concerned or even quite supportive of larger budget deficits in the short run of a few years during and immediately after a severe recession.\n\nA glance back at economic history provides a second illustration of the power of automatic stabilizers. Remember that the length of economic upswings between recessions has become longer in the U.S. economy in recent decades (as discussed in [Unemployment](/m48719){: .target-chapter}). The three longest economic booms of the twentieth century happened in the 1960s, the 1980s, and the 1991\u20132001 time period. One reason why the economy has tipped into recession less frequently in recent decades is that the size of government spending and taxes has increased in the second half of the twentieth century. Thus, the automatic stabilizing effects from spending and taxes are now larger than they were in the first half of the twentieth century. Around 1900, for example, federal spending was only about 2% of GDP. In 1929, just before the Great Depression hit, government spending was still just 4% of GDP. In those earlier times, the smaller size of government made automatic stabilizers far less powerful than in the last few decades, when government spending often hovers at 20% of GDP or more.\n\n### The Standardized Employment Deficit or Surplus\n\nEach year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculates the **standardized employment budget**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014that is, what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP, where people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making normal profits, with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more taxes. In effect, the standardized employment deficit eliminates the impact of the automatic stabilizers. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_012) compares the actual budget deficits of recent decades with the CBO\u2019s standardized deficit.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to learn more from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n is higher than the actual budget deficit (or surplus) because the economy is producing about potential GDP, so the automatic stabilizers are increasing taxes and reducing the need for government spending. (Sources: Actual and Cyclically Adjusted Budget Surpluses/Deficits, http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43977; and  Economic Report of the President, Table B-1, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2013/content-detail.html)\"){: #CNX_Econ_C30_012 data-title=\"Comparison of Actual Budget Deficits with the Standardized Employment Deficit \"}\n\nNotice that in recession years, like the early 1990s, 2001, or 2009, the standardized employment deficit is smaller than the actual deficit. During recessions, the automatic stabilizers tend to increase the budget deficit, so if the economy was instead at full employment, the deficit would be reduced. However, in the late 1990s the standardized employment budget surplus was lower than the actual budget surplus. The gap between the standardized budget deficit or surplus and the actual budget deficit or surplus shows the impact of the automatic stabilizers. More generally, the standardized budget figures allow you to see what the budget deficit would look like with the economy held constant\u2014at its potential GDP level of output.\n\nAutomatic stabilizers occur quickly. Lower wages means that a lower amount of taxes is withheld from paychecks right away. Higher unemployment or poverty means that government spending in those areas rises as quickly as people apply for benefits. However, while the automatic stabilizers offset part of the shifts in aggregate demand, they do not offset all or even most of it. Historically, automatic stabilizers on the tax and spending side offset about 10% of any initial movement in the level of output. This offset may not seem enormous, but it is still useful. Automatic stabilizers, like shock absorbers in a car, can be useful if they reduce the impact of the worst bumps, even if they do not eliminate the bumps altogether.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nFiscal policy is conducted both through discretionary fiscal policy, which occurs when the government enacts taxation or spending changes in response to economic events, or through automatic stabilizers, which are taxing and spending mechanisms that, by their design, shift in response to economic events without any further legislation. The standardized employment budget is the calculation of what the budget deficit or budget surplus would have been in a given year if the economy had been producing at its potential GDP in that year. Many economists and politicians criticize the use of fiscal policy for a variety of reasons, including concerns over time lags, the impact on interest rates, and the inherently political nature of fiscal policy. We cover the critique of fiscal policy in the next module.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIn a recession, does the actual budget surplus or deficit fall above or below the standardized employment budget?\n\n\n\nIt falls below because less tax revenue than expected is collected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the main advantage of automatic stabilizers over discretionary fiscal policy?\n\n\n\nAutomatic stabilizers take effect very quickly, whereas discretionary policy can take a long time to implement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain how automatic stabilizers work, both on the taxation side and on the spending side, first in a situation where the economy is producing less than potential GDP and then in a situation where the economy is producing more than potential GDP.\n\n\n\nIn a recession, because of the decline in economic output, less income is earned, and so less in taxes is automatically collected. Many welfare and unemployment programs are designed so that those who fall into certain categories, like \u201cunemployed\u201d or \u201clow income,\u201d are eligible for benefits. During a recession, more people fall into these categories and become eligible for benefits automatically. The combination of reduced taxes and higher spending is just what is needed for an economy in recession producing below potential GDP. With an economic boom, average income levels rise in the economy, so more in taxes is automatically collected. Fewer people meet the criteria for receiving government assistance to the unemployed or the needy, so government spending on unemployment assistance and welfare falls automatically. This combination of higher taxes and lower spending is just what is needed if an economy is producing above its potential GDP.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between discretionary fiscal policy and automatic stabilizers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do automatic stabilizers function \u201cautomatically?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the standardized employment budget?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nIs Medicaid (federal government aid to low-income families and individuals) an automatic stabilizer?\n\n\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nautomatic stabilizers\n: tax and spending rules that have the effect of slowing down the rate of decrease in aggregate demand when the economy slows down and restraining aggregate demand when the economy speeds up, without any additional change in legislation\n^\n\ndiscretionary fiscal policy\n: the government passes a new law that explicitly changes overall tax or spending levels with the intent of influencing the level or overall economic activity\n^\n\nstandardized employment budget\n: the budget deficit or surplus in any given year adjusted for what it would have been if the economy were producing at potential GDP\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/CBO", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48798", "module_title": "Economics - m48798", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48798", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Understand how fiscal policy and monetary policy are interconnected\n* Explain the three lag times that often occur when solving economic problems.\n* Identify the legal and political challenges of responding to an economic problem.\n\n\n\nIn the early 1960s, many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle, and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation, were a thing of the past. On the cover of its December 31, 1965, issue, *Time* magazine, then the premier news magazine in the United States, ran a picture of **John Maynard Keynes**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as \u201cthe prime influence on the world\u2019s economies.\u201d The article reported that policymakers have \u201cused Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent \\[business\\] cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices.\u201d\n\nThis happy consensus, however, did not last. The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970, a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975, and then double-dip recessions from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982. At various times, inflation and unemployment both soared. Clearly, the problems of macroeconomic policy had not been completely solved. As economists began to consider what had gone wrong, they identified a number of issues that make discretionary fiscal policy more difficult than it had seemed in the rosy optimism of the mid-1960s.\n\n### Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates\n\nBecause fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in **financial capital markets**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, it not only affects aggregate demand\u2014it can also affect interest rates. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C30_013), the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) in the financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $800 billion and an interest rate of 6%. However, an increase in government budget deficits shifts the demand for financial capital from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at a quantity of $900 billion and an interest rate of 7%.\n\nA consensus estimate based on a number of studies is that an increase in budget deficits (or a fall in budget surplus) by 1% of GDP will cause an increase of 0.5\u20131.0% in the long-term interest rate.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C30_013 data-title=\"Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates \"}\n\nA problem arises here. An expansionary fiscal policy, with tax cuts or spending increases, is intended to increase aggregate demand. If an expansionary fiscal policy also causes higher interest rates, then firms and households are discouraged from borrowing and spending (as occurs with tight monetary policy), thus reducing aggregate demand. Even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates, fiscal policy can end up being less powerful than was originally expected. This is referred to as **crowding out**{: data-type=\"term\"}, where government borrowing and spending results in higher interest rates, which reduces business investment and household consumption.\n\nThe broader lesson is that fiscal and monetary policy must be coordinated. If expansionary fiscal policy is to work well, then the central bank can also reduce or keep short-term interest rates low. Conversely, monetary policy can also help to ensure that contractionary fiscal policy does not lead to a recession.\n\n### Long and Variable Time Lags\n\nMonetary policy can be changed several times each year, but fiscal policy is much slower to be enacted. Imagine that the economy starts to slow down. It often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started, and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one- or two-month blip. The time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred is often called the **recognition lag**{: data-type=\"term\"}. After this lag, policymakers become aware of the problem and propose fiscal policy bills. The bills go into various congressional committees for hearings, negotiations, votes, and then, if passed, eventually for the president\u2019s signature. Many fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time. The time to get a bill passed is often referred to as the **legislative lag**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Finally, once the bill is passed it takes some time for the funds to be dispersed to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs. The time to get the projects started is often called the **implementation lag**{: data-type=\"term\"}.\n\nMoreover, the exact level of fiscal policy to be implemented is never completely clear. Should the budget deficit be increased by 0.5% of GDP? By 1% of GDP? By 2% of GDP? In an AD/AS diagram, it is straightforward to sketch an aggregate demand curve shifting to the potential GDP level of output. In the real world, the actual level of potential output is known only roughly, not precisely, and exactly how a spending cut or tax increase will affect aggregate demand is always somewhat controversial. Also unknown is the state of the economy at any point in time. During the early days of the Obama administration, for example, no one knew how deep in the hole the economy really was. During the financial crisis of 2008-09, the rapid collapse of the banking system and automotive sector made it difficult to assess how quickly the economy was collapsing.\n\nThus, it can take many months or even more than a year to begin an expansionary fiscal policy after a recession has started\u2014and even then, uncertainty will remain over exactly how much to expand or contract taxes and spending. When politicians attempt to use countercyclical fiscal policy to fight recession or inflation, they run the risk of responding to the macroeconomic situation of two or three years ago, in a way that may be exactly wrong for the economy at that time. George P. Schultz, a professor of economics, former Secretary of the Treasury, and Director of the Office of Management and Budget, once wrote: \u201cWhile the economist is accustomed to the concept of lags, the politician likes instant results. The tension comes because, as I have seen on many occasions, the economist\u2019s lag is the politician\u2019s nightmare.\u201d\n\n### Temporary and Permanent Fiscal Policy\n\nA temporary tax cut or spending increase will explicitly last only for a year or two, and then revert back to its original level. A permanent tax cut or spending increase is expected to stay in place for the foreseeable future. The effect of temporary and permanent fiscal policies on aggregate demand can be very different. Consider how you would react if the government announced a tax cut that would last one year and then be repealed, in comparison with how you would react if the government announced a permanent tax cut. Most people and firms will react more strongly to a permanent policy change than a temporary one.\n\nThis fact creates an unavoidable difficulty for countercyclical fiscal policy. The appropriate policy may be to have an expansionary fiscal policy with large budget deficits during a recession, and then a contractionary fiscal policy with budget surpluses when the economy is growing well. But if both policies are explicitly temporary ones, they will have a less powerful effect than a permanent policy.\n\n### Structural Economic Change Takes Time\n\nWhen an economy recovers from a recession, it does not usually revert back to its exact earlier shape. Instead, the internal structure of the economy evolves and changes and this process can take time. For example, much of the economic growth of the mid-2000s was in the sectors of construction (especially of housing) and finance. However, when housing prices started falling in 2007 and the resulting financial crunch led into recession (as discussed in [Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation](/m48768)), both sectors contracted. The manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy has been losing jobs in recent years as well, under pressure from technological change and foreign competition. Many of the people thrown out of work from these sectors in the Great Recession of 2008\u20132009 will never return to the same jobs in the same sectors of the economy; instead, the economy will need to grow in new and different directions, as the following Clear It Up feature shows. Fiscal policy can increase overall demand, but the process of structural economic change\u2014the expansion of a new set of industries and the movement of workers to those industries\u2014inevitably takes time.\n\n\n\nWhy do jobs vanish?\n\nPeople can lose jobs for a variety of reasons: because of a recession, but also because of longer-run changes in the economy, such as new technology. Productivity improvements in auto manufacturing, for example, can reduce the number of workers needed, and eliminate these jobs in the long run. The Internet has created jobs but also caused the loss of jobs as well, from travel agents to book store clerks. Many of these jobs may never come back. Short-run fiscal policy to reduce unemployment can create jobs, but it cannot replace jobs that will never return.\n\n\n\n### The Limitations of Fiscal Policy\n\nFiscal policy can help an economy that is producing below its potential GDP to expand aggregate demand so that it produces closer to potential GDP, thus lowering unemployment. But fiscal policy cannot help an economy produce at an output level above potential GDP without causing inflation At this point, unemployment becomes so low that workers become scarce and wages rise rapidly.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read about how the recovery is being affected by fiscal policies.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Political Realties and Discretionary Fiscal Policy\n\nA final problem for discretionary fiscal policy arises out of the difficulties of explaining to politicians how countercyclical fiscal policy that runs against the tide of the business cycle should work. Politicians often have a gut-level belief that when the economy and tax revenues slow down, it is time to hunker down, pinch pennies, and trim expenses. Countercyclical policy, however, says that when the economy has slowed down, it is time for the government to go on a spree, raising spending, and cutting taxes. This offsets the drop in the economy in the other sectors. Conversely, when economic times are good and tax revenues are rolling in, politicians often feel that it is time for tax cuts and new spending. But countercyclical policy says that this economic boom should be an appropriate time for keeping taxes high and restraining spending.\n\nPoliticians tend to prefer expansionary fiscal policy over contractionary policy. There is rarely a shortage of proposals for tax cuts and spending increases, especially during recessions. However, politicians are less willing to hear the message that in good economic times, they should propose tax increases and spending limits. In the economic upswing of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, the U.S. GDP grew rapidly. Estimates from respected government economic forecasters like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget stated that the GDP was above potential GDP, and that unemployment rates were unsustainably low. However, no mainstream politician took the lead in saying that the booming economic times might be an appropriate time for spending cuts or tax increases.\n\n### Discretionary Fiscal Policy: Summing Up\n\nExpansionary fiscal policy can help to end recessions and contractionary fiscal policy can help to reduce inflation. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags, temporary and permanent policies, and unpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers had concluded by the mid-1990s that discretionary fiscal policy was a blunt instrument, more like a club than a scalpel. It might still make sense to use it in extreme economic situations, like an especially deep or long recession. For less extreme situations, it was often preferable to let fiscal policy work through the automatic stabilizers and focus on monetary policy to steer short-term countercyclical efforts.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nBecause fiscal policy affects the quantity of money that the government borrows in financial capital markets, it not only affects aggregate demand\u2014it can also affect interest rates. If an expansionary fiscal policy also causes higher interest rates, then firms and households are discouraged from borrowing and spending, reducing aggregate demand in a situation called crowding out. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags (implementation lag, legislative lag, and recognition lag), temporary and permanent policies, and unpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers have concluded that discretionary fiscal policy is a blunt instrument and better used only in extreme situations.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhat would happen if expansionary fiscal policy was implemented in a recession but, due to lag, did not actually take effect until after the economy was back to potential GDP?\n\n\n\nPrices would be pushed up as a result of too much spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would happen if contractionary fiscal policy were implemented during an economic boom but, due to lag, it did not take effect until the economy slipped into recession?\n\n\n\nEmployment would suffer as a result of too little spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo you think the typical time lag for fiscal policy is likely to be longer or shorter than the time lag for monetary policy? Explain your answer?\n\n\n\nMonetary policy probably has shorter time lags than fiscal policy. Imagine that the data becomes fairly clear that an economy is in or near a recession. Expansionary monetary policy can be carried out through open market operations, which can be done fairly quickly, since the Federal Reserve\u2019s Open Market Committee meets six times a year. Also, monetary policy takes effect through interest rates, which can change fairly quickly. However, fiscal policy is carried out through acts of Congress that need to be signed into law by the president. Negotiating such laws often takes months, and even after the laws are negotiated, it takes more months for spending programs or tax cuts to have an effect on the macroeconomy.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are some practical weaknesses of discretionary fiscal policy?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is a potential problem with a temporary tax increase designed to increase aggregate demand if people know that it is temporary?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the government gives a $300 tax cut to everyone in the country, explain the mechanism by which this will cause interest rates to rise.\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nLeduc, Sylvain, and Daniel Wilson.

In 1995, a proposed constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a wide margin, and failed in the U.S. Senate by only a single vote. (For the balanced budget to have become an amendment to the Constitution would have required a two-thirds vote by Congress and passage by three-quarters of the state legislatures.)\n\nMost economists view the proposals for a perpetually **balanced budget**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} with bemusement. After all, in the short term, economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers. Economic recessions should automatically lead to larger budget deficits or smaller budget surpluses, while economic booms lead to smaller deficits or larger surpluses. A requirement that the budget be balanced each and every year would prevent these automatic stabilizers from working and would worsen the severity of economic fluctuations.\n\nSome supporters of the balanced budget amendment like to argue that, since households must balance their own budgets, the government should too. But this analogy between household and government behavior is severely flawed. Most households do not balance their budgets every year. Some years households borrow to buy houses or cars or to pay for medical expenses or college tuition. Other years they repay loans and save funds in retirement accounts. After retirement, they withdraw and spend those savings. Also, the government is not a household for many reasons, one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities. The argument of **Keynesian macroeconomic policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is that the government needs to lean against the wind, spending when times are hard and saving when times are good, for the sake of the overall economy.\n\nThere is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years. For example, a government may decide that by running large budget deficits, it can make crucial long-term investments in **human capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and physical **infrastructure**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} that will build the long-term productivity of a country. These decisions may work out well or poorly, but they are not always irrational. Such policies of ongoing government budget deficits may persist for decades. As the U.S. experience from the end of World War II up to about 1980 shows, it is perfectly possible to run budget deficits almost every year for decades, but as long as the percentage increases in debt are smaller than the percentage growth of GDP, the debt/GDP ratio will decline at the same time.\n\nNothing in this argument should be taken as a claim that budget deficits are always a wise policy. In the short run, a government that runs a very large budget deficit can shift aggregate demand to the right and trigger severe inflation. Additionally, governments may borrow for foolish or impractical reasons. [The Macroeconomic Impacts of Government Borrowing](/m48800){: .target-chapter} will discuss how large budget deficits, by reducing national saving, can in certain cases reduce economic growth and even contribute to international financial crises. A requirement that the budget be balanced in each calendar year, however, is a misguided overreaction to the fear that in some cases, budget deficits can become too large.\n\n\n\nNo Yellowstone Park?\n\nThe federal budget shutdown of 2013 illustrated the many sides to fiscal policy and the federal budget. In 2013, Republicans and Democrats could not agree on which spending policies to fund and how large the government debt should be. Due to the severity of the recession in 2008\u20132009, the fiscal stimulus, and previous policies, the federal budget deficit and debt was historically high. One way to try to cut federal spending and borrowing was to refuse to raise the legal federal debt limit, or tie on conditions to appropriation bills to stop the Affordable Health Care Act. This disagreement led to a two-week shutdown of the federal government and got close to the deadline where the federal government would default on its Treasury bonds. Finally, however, a compromise emerged and default was avoided. This shows clearly how closely fiscal policies are tied to politics.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nBalanced budget amendments are a popular political idea, but the economic merits behind such proposals are questionable. Most economists accept that fiscal policy needs to be flexible enough to accommodate unforeseen expenditures, such as wars or recessions. While persistent, large budget deficits can indeed be a problem, a balanced budget amendment prevents even small, temporary deficits that might, in some cases, be necessary.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nHow would a balanced budget amendment affect a decision by Congress to grant a tax cut during a recession?\n\n\n\nThe government would have to make up the revenue either by raising taxes in a different area or cutting spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would a balanced budget amendment change the effect of automatic stabilizer programs?\n\n\n\nPrograms where the amount of spending is not fixed, but rather determined by macroeconomic conditions, such as food stamps, would lose a great deal of flexibility if spending increases had to be met by corresponding tax increases or spending cuts.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the arguments for and against a requirement that the federal government budget be balanced every year?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nDo you agree or disagree with this statement: \u201cIt is in the best interest of our economy for Congress and the President to run a balanced budget each year.\u201d Explain your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the Great Recession of 2008\u20132009, what actions would have been required of Congress and the President had a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution been ratified?

With a stroke of the pen, he implemented what we know as the financial aid, work study, and student loan programs to help Americans pay for a college education. In his remarks, the President said:\n\n<q>Here the seeds were planted from which grew my firm conviction that for the individual, education is the path to achievement and fulfillment; for the Nation, it is a path to a society that is not only free but civilized; and for the world, it is the path to peace\u2014for it is education that places reason over force.</q>\n\nThis Act, he said, \\\"is responsible for funding higher education for millions of Americans. It is the embodiment of the United States\u2019 investment in \u2018human capital\u2019.\\\" Since the Act was first signed into law, it has been renewed several times.\n\nThe purpose of The Higher Education Act of 1965 was to build the country\u2019s human capital by creating educational opportunity for millions of Americans. The three criteria used to judge eligibility are income, full-time or part-time attendance, and the cost of the institution. According to the 2011\u20132012 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:12), in the 2011\u20132012 school year, over 70% of all full-time college students received some form of federal financial aid; 47% received grants; and another 55% received federal government student loans. The budget to support financial aid has increased not only because of increased enrollment, but also because of increased tuition and fees for higher education. These increases are currently being questioned. The President and Congress are charged with balancing fiscal responsibility and important government-financed expenditures like investing in human capital.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to the Impacts of Government Borrowing\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade Balance\n* Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth\n* How Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving\n* Fiscal Policy and the Trade Balance\n\n\n\nGovernments have many competing demands for financial support. Any spending should be tempered by fiscal responsibility and by looking carefully at the spending\u2019s impact. When a government spends more than it collects in taxes, it runs a budget deficit. It then needs to borrow. When government borrowing becomes especially large and sustained, it can substantially reduce the financial capital available to private sector firms, as well as lead to trade imbalances and even financial crises.\n\nThe [Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy](/m48791) chapter introduced the concepts of deficits and debt, as well as how a government could use fiscal policy to address recession or inflation. This chapter begins by building on the national savings and investment identity, first introduced in [The International Trade and Capital Flows](/m48731) chapter, to show how government borrowing affects firms\u2019 physical capital investment levels and trade balances. A prolonged period of budget deficits may lead to lower economic growth, in part because the funds borrowed by the government to fund its budget deficits are typically no longer available for private investment. Moreover, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits can lead to disruptive economic patterns of high inflation, substantial inflows of financial capital from abroad, plummeting exchange rates, and heavy strains on a country\u2019s banking and financial system.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

Let\u2019s begin with a review of why one of these three options must occur, and then explore how interest rates and exchange rates adjust to these connections.\n\n### The National Saving and Investment Identity\n\nThe national saving and investment identity, first introduced in [The International Trade and Capital Flows](/m48731){: .target-chapter} chapter, provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in **financial capital markets**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true: the quantity of **financial capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded.\n\nThe U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital: private savings from inside the U.S. economy and public savings.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Total\u00a0savings\u00a0=\u00a0Private\u00a0savings\u00a0(S)\u00a0+\u00a0Public\u00a0savings\u00a0(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)</mtext></math>\n\n\nThese include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad. The inflow of savings from abroad is, by definition, equal to the trade deficit, as explained in [The International Trade and Capital Flows](/m48731){: .target-chapter} chapter. So this inflow of foreign investment capital can be written as imports (M) minus exports (X). There are also two main sources of demand for financial capital: private sector investment (I) and government borrowing. Government borrowing in any given year is equal to the budget deficit, and can be written as the difference between government spending (G) and net taxes (T).

If this is the case, governments can be viewed as demanders of financial capital instead of suppliers.

What is alarming is the dramatic increase in budget deficits that has occurred since 2008, which in part reflects declining tax revenues and increased safety net expenditures due to the Great Recession. (Recall that T is net taxes. When the government must transfer funds back to individuals for safety net expenditures like Social Security and unemployment benefits, budget deficits rise.) These deficits have implications for the future health of the U.S. economy.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C31_010 data-title=\"United States On-Budget, Surplus, and Deficit, 1977&#x2013;2014 ($ millions) \"}\n\nA rising budget deficit may result in a fall in domestic investment, a rise in private savings, or a rise in the trade deficit.

Government borrowing can reduce the financial capital available for private firms to invest in physical capital. But government spending can also encourage certain elements of long-term growth, such as spending on roads or water systems, on education, or on research and development that creates new technology.\n\n### Crowding Out Physical Capital Investment\n\nA larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital. If private saving and the trade balance remain the same, then less financial capital will be available for private investment in **physical capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital, the result is known as **crowding out**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the situation of the U.S. economy before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007. In 2005, for example, the budget deficit was roughly 4% of GDP. Private investment by firms in the U.S. economy has hovered in the range of 14% to 18% of GDP in recent decades. However, in any given year, roughly half of U.S. investment in physical capital just replaces machinery and equipment that has worn out or become technologically obsolete. Only about half represents an increase in the total quantity of physical capital in the economy. So investment in new physical capital in any year is about 7% to 9% of GDP. In this situation, even U.S. budget deficits in the range of 4% of GDP can potentially crowd out a substantial share of new investment spending. Conversely, a smaller budget deficit (or an increased budget surplus) increases the pool of financial capital available for private investment.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to view the \u201cU.S. Debt Clock.\u201d\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nThe patterns of U.S. budget deficits and private investment since 1980 are shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C31_003). If greater government deficits lead to less private investment in physical capital, and reduced government deficits or budget surpluses lead to more investment in physical capital, these two lines should move up and down at the same time. This pattern occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The U.S. federal budget went from a deficit of 2.2% of GDP in 1995 to a budget surplus of 2.4% of GDP in 2000\u2014a swing of 4.6% of GDP. From 1995 to 2000, private investment in physical capital rose from 15% to 18% of GDP\u2014a rise of 3% of GDP. Then, when the U.S. government again started running budget deficits in the early 2000s, less financial capital became available for private investment, and the rate of private investment fell back to about 15% of GDP by 2003.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C31_003 data-title=\"U.S. Budget Deficits/Surpluses and Private Investment \"}\n\nThis argument does not claim that a government\\'s budget deficits will exactly shadow its national rate of private investment; after all, private saving and inflows of foreign financial investment must also be taken into account. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits increased substantially without a corresponding drop off in private investment. In 2009, nonresidential private fixed investment dropped by $300 billion from its previous level of $1,941 billion in 2008, primarily because, during a recession, firms lack both the funds and the incentive to invest. Investment growth between 2009 and 2014 averaged approximately 5.9% to $2,210.5 billion\u2014only slightly above its 2008 level, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. During that same period, interest rates dropped from 3.94% to less than a quarter percent as the Federal Reserve took dramatic action to prevent a depression by increasing the money supply through lowering short-term interest rates. The \\\"crowding out\\\" of private investment due to government borrowing to finance expenditures appears to have been suspended during the Great Recession. However, as the economy improves and interest rates rise, borrowing by the government may potentially create pressure on interest rates.\n\n### The Interest Rate Connection\n\nAssume that government borrowing of substantial amounts will have an effect on the quantity of private investment. How will this affect interest rates in financial markets? In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C31_004), the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) where the **demand curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (D<sub>0</sub>) for financial capital intersects with the **supply curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (S<sub>0</sub>) occurs at an interest rate of 5% and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20% of GDP. However, as the government budget deficit increases, the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub>. The new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>) occurs at an interest rate of 6% and an equilibrium quantity of 21% of GDP.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C31_004 data-title=\"Budget Deficits and Interest Rates \"}\n\nA survey of economic studies on the connection between government borrowing and interest rates in the U.S. economy suggests that an increase of 1% in the budget deficit will lead to a rise in interest rates of between 0.5 and 1.0%, other factors held equal. In turn, a higher interest rate tends to discourage firms from making physical capital investments. One reason government budget deficits crowd out private investment, therefore, is the increase in interest rates. There are, however, economic studies that show a limited connection between the two (at least in the United States), but as the budget deficit grows, the dangers of rising interest rates become more real.\n\nAt this point, you may wonder about the **Federal Reserve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. After all, can the Federal Reserve not use expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates, or in this case, to prevent interest rates from rising? This useful question emphasizes the importance of considering how fiscal and monetary policies work in relation to each other. Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits, causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment. If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP, threatening an inflationary increase in price levels, the central bank may react with a **contractionary monetary policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. In this situation, the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy, and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment.\n\nOn the other hand, if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP, an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with **expansionary monetary policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. In this situation, higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy, and there would be little crowding out of private investment.\n\nHowever, even a central bank cannot erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity. If government borrowing rises, then private investment must fall, or private saving must rise, or the trade deficit must fall. By reacting with contractionary or expansionary monetary policy, the central bank can only help to determine which of these outcomes is likely.\n\n### Public Investment in Physical Capital\n\nGovernment can invest in physical capital directly: roads and bridges; water supply and sewers; seaports and airports; schools and hospitals; plants that generate electricity, like hydroelectric dams or windmills; telecommunications facilities; and weapons used by the military. In 2014, the U.S. federal government budget for Fiscal Year 2014 shows that the United States spent about $92 billion on transportation, including highways, mass transit, and airports. [\\[link\\]](#Table_31_01) shows the total outlay for 2014 for major public physical capital investment by the federal government in the United States. Physical capital related to the military or to residences where people live is omitted from this table, because the focus here is on public investments that have a direct effect on raising output in the private sector.\n\n<table id=\"Table_31_01\" summary=\"The table shows the type of public physical capital in column 1 and the 2011 federal outlays in billions of dollars in column 2.

An economy with reliable roads and electricity will be able to produce more. But it is hard to quantify how much government investment in physical capital will benefit the economy, because government responds to political as well as economic incentives. When a firm makes an investment in physical capital, it is subject to the discipline of the market: If it does not receive a positive return on investment, the firm may lose money or even go out of business.\n\nIn some cases, lawmakers make investments in physical capital as a way of spending money in the districts of key politicians. The result may be unnecessary roads or office buildings. Even if a project is useful and necessary, it might be done in a way that is excessively costly, because local contractors who make campaign contributions to politicians appreciate the extra business. On the other hand, governments sometimes do not make the investments they should because a decision to spend on infrastructure does not need to just make economic sense; it must be politically popular as well. Managing public investment so that it is done in a cost-effective way can be difficult.\n\nIf a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital with higher taxes or lower government spending in other areas, it need not worry that it is directly crowding out private investment. Indirectly however, higher household taxes could cut down on the level of private savings available and have a similar effect. If a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital by borrowing, it may end up increasing the quantity of public physical capital at the cost of crowding out investment in private physical capital, which is more beneficial to the economy would be dependent on the project being considered.\n\n### Public Investment in Human Capital\n\nIn most countries, the government plays a large role in society\\'s investment in human capital through the education system. A highly educated and skilled workforce contributes to a higher rate of economic growth. For the low-income nations of the world, additional investment in human capital seems likely to increase productivity and growth. For the United States, tough questions have been raised about how much increases in government spending on education will improve the actual level of education.\n\nAmong economists, discussions of education reform often begin with some uncomfortable facts. As shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C31_011), spending per student for kindergarten through grade 12 (K\u201312) increased substantially in real dollars through 2010. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that current spending per pupil for elementary and secondary education rose from $5,001 in 1998 to $10,608 in 2012. However, as measured by standardized tests like the SAT, the level of student academic achievement has barely budged in recent decades. Indeed, on international tests, U.S. students lag behind students from many other countries. (Of course, test scores are an imperfect measure of education for a variety of reasons. It would be difficult, however, to argue that there are not real problems in the U.S. education system and that the tests are just inaccurate.)\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C31_011 data-title=\"Total Spending for Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education (1998&#x2013;2014) in the United States \"}\n\nThe fact that increased financial resources have not brought greater measurable gains in student performance has led some education experts to question whether the problems may be due to structure, not just to the resources spent.\n\nOther government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the K\u201312 education system. Programs for early childhood education, like the federal **Head Start program**{: data-type=\"term\"}, are directed at families where the parents may have limited educational and financial resources. Government also offers substantial support for universities and colleges. For example, in the United States about 60% of students take at least a few college or university classes beyond the high school level. In Germany and Japan, about half of all students take classes beyond the comparable high school level. In the countries of Latin America, only about one student in four takes classes beyond the high school level, and in the nations of sub-Saharan Africa, only about one student in 20.\n\nNot all spending on educational **human capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} needs to happen through the government: many college students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education. If low-income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade-school children, government spending seems likely to play a substantial role. For the U.S. economy, and for other high-income countries, the primary focus at this time is more on how to get a bigger return from existing spending on education and how to improve the performance of the average high school graduate, rather than dramatic increases in education spending.\n\n### How Fiscal Policy Can Improve Technology\n\nResearch and development (R&amp;D) efforts are the lifeblood of new technology. According to the National Science Foundation, federal outlays for research, development, and physical plant improvements to various governmental agencies have remained at an average of 8.8% of GDP. About one-fifth of U.S. R&amp;D spending goes to defense and space-oriented research. Although defense-oriented R&amp;D spending may sometimes produce consumer-oriented spinoffs, R&amp;D that is aimed at producing new weapons is less likely to benefit the civilian economy than direct civilian R&amp;D spending.\n\nFiscal policy can encourage R&amp;D using either direct spending or tax policy. Government could spend more on the R&amp;D that is carried out in government laboratories, as well as expanding federal R&amp;D grants to universities and colleges, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector. By 2014, the federal share of R&amp;D outlays totaled $135.5 billion, or about 4% of the federal government\\'s total budget outlays, according to data from the National Science Foundation. Fiscal policy can also support R&amp;D through tax incentives, which allow firms to reduce their tax bill as they increase spending on research and development.\n\n### Summary of Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth\n\nInvestment in physical capital, human capital, and new technology is essential for long-term economic growth, as summarized in [\\[link\\]](#Table_31_02). In a market-oriented economy, private firms will undertake most of the investment in physical capital, and fiscal policy should seek to avoid a long series of outsized budget deficits that might crowd out such investment. The effects of many growth-oriented policies will be seen very gradually over time, as students are better educated, physical capital investments are made, and new technologies are invented and implemented.\n\n<table id=\"Table_31_02\" summary=\"The table shows how the private and public sectors invest in physical capital, human capital and new technology. The table shows the following for private sector investments: physical capital = new investment in property and equipment; human capital = on-the-job training; new technology = research and development.

Government borrowing can crowd out private sector investment in physical capital, but fiscal policy can also increase investment in publicly owned physical capital, human capital (education), and research and development. Possible methods for improving education and society\u2019s investment in human capital include spending more money on teachers and other educational resources, and reorganizing the education system to provide greater incentives for success. Methods for increasing research and development spending to generate new technology include direct government spending on R&amp;D and tax incentives for businesses to conduct additional R&amp;D.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhy have many education experts recently placed an emphasis on altering the incentives faced by U.S. schools rather than on increasing their budgets? Without endorsing any of these proposals as especially good or bad, list some of the ways in which incentives for schools might be altered.\n\n\n\nIn the last few decades, spending per student has climbed substantially. However, test scores have fallen over this time. This experience has led a number of experts to argue that the problem is not resources\u2014or is not just resources by itself\u2014but is also a problem of how schools are organized and managed and what incentives they have for success. There are a number of proposals to alter the incentives that schools face, but relatively little hard evidence on what proposals work well. Without trying to evaluate whether these proposals are good or bad ideas, you can just list some of them: testing students regularly; rewarding teachers or schools that perform well on such tests; requiring additional teacher training; allowing students to choose between public schools; allowing teachers and parents to start new schools; giving student \u201cvouchers\u201d that they can use to pay tuition at either public or private schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some steps the government can take to encourage research and development?\n\n\n\nThe government can direct government spending to R&amp;D. It can also create tax incentives for business to invest in R&amp;D.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the ways fiscal policy might encourage economic growth?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some fiscal policies for improving a society\u2019s human capital?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some fiscal policies for improving the technologies that the economy will have to draw upon in the future?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain how cuts in funding for programs such as Head Start might affect the development of human capital in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nExplain why the government might prefer to provide incentives to private firms to do investment or research and development, rather than simply doing the spending itself?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder what condition would crowding out not inhibit long-run economic growth? Under what condition would crowding out impede long-run economic growth?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat must take place for the government to run deficits without any crowding out?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nDuring the most recent recession, some economists argued that the change in the interest rates that comes about due to deficit spending implied in the demand and supply of financial capital graph would not occur. A simple reason was that the government was stepping in to invest when private firms were not. Using a graph, explain how the deficit demand is offset by the use by government in investment.\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce: Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cNational Data: National Income and Product Accounts Tables.\u201d Accessed December 1, 2013. http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&amp;step=1#reqid=9&amp;step=3&amp;isuri=1&amp;910=X&amp;911=0&amp;903=146&amp;904=2008&amp;905=2013&amp;906=A.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, \u201cSelected Interest Rates (Daily) \u2013 H.15.\u201d Accessed December 10, 2013. http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm.\n\nThe White House. \u201cFiscal Year 2013 Historical Tables: Budget of the U.S. Government.\u201d Accessed December 12, 2013. http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist.pdf.\n\nThe National Science Foundation.

Imagine that people watch government budgets and adjust their savings accordingly. For example, whenever the government runs a budget deficit, people might reason: \u201cWell, a higher budget deficit means that I\u2019m just going to owe more taxes in the future to pay off all that government borrowing, so I\u2019ll start saving now.\u201d If the government runs budget surpluses, people might reason: \u201cWith these budget surpluses (or lower budget deficits), interest rates are falling, so that saving is less attractive. Moreover, with a budget surplus the country will be able to afford a tax cut sometime in the future. I won\u2019t bother saving as much now.\u201d\n\nThe theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as **Ricardian equivalence**{: data-type=\"term\"} because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo (1772\u20131823). If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true, then in the national saving and investment identity, any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving. As a result, changes in government borrowing would have no effect at all on either physical capital investment or trade balances.\n\nIn practice, the private sector only sometimes and partially adjusts its savings behavior to offset government budget deficits and surpluses. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C31_006) shows the patterns of U.S. government budget deficits and surpluses and the rate of private saving\u2014which includes saving by both households and firms\u2014since 1980. The connection between the two is not at all obvious. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits were quite large, but there is no corresponding surge of private saving. However, when budget deficits turn to surpluses in the late 1990s, there is a simultaneous decline in private saving. When budget deficits get very large in 2008 and 2009, on the other hand, there is some sign of a rise in saving. A variety of statistical studies based on the U.S. experience suggests that when government borrowing increases by $1, private saving rises by about 30 cents. A World Bank study done in the late 1990s, looking at government budgets and private saving behavior in countries around the world, found a similar result.\n\n \"){: #CNX_Econ_C31_006 data-title=\"U.S. Budget Deficits and Private Savings \"}\n\nSo private saving does increase to some extent when governments run large budget deficits, and private saving falls when governments reduce deficits or run large budget surpluses. However, the offsetting effects of private saving compared to government borrowing are much less than one-to-one. In addition, this effect can vary a great deal from country to country, from time to time, and over the short run and the long run.\n\nIf the funding for a larger budget deficit comes from international financial investors, then a budget deficit may be accompanied by a trade deficit. In some countries, this pattern of a **twin deficits**{: data-type=\"term\"} has set the stage for international financial investors first to send their funds to a country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and then to pull their funds out and cause a depreciation of the exchange rate and a financial crisis as well. It depends on whether funding comes from international financial investors.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe theory of Ricardian equivalence holds that changes in government borrowing or saving will be offset by changes in private saving. Thus, higher budget deficits will be offset by greater private saving, while larger budget surpluses will be offset by greater private borrowing. If the theory holds true, then changes in government borrowing or saving would have no effect on private investment in physical capital or on the trade balance. However, empirical evidence suggests that the theory holds true only partially.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nImagine an economy in which Ricardian equivalence holds. This economy has a budget deficit of 50, a trade deficit of 20, private savings of 130, and investment of 100. If the budget deficit rises to 70, how are the other terms in the national saving and investment identity affected?\n\n\n\nRicardian equivalence means that private saving changes to offset exactly any changes in the government budget. So, if the deficit increases by 20, private saving increases by 20 as well, and the trade deficit and the budget deficit will not change from their original levels. The original national saving and investment identity is written below. Notice that if any change in the (G \u2013 T) term is offset by a change in the S term, then the other terms do not change. So if (G \u2013 T) rises by 20, then S must also increase by 20.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Quantity\u00a0supplied\u00a0of\u00a0financial\u00a0capital</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Quantity\u00a0demanded\u00a0of\u00a0financial\u00a0capital</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>S\u00a0+\u00a0(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0X)</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>I\u00a0+\u00a0(G\u00a0\u2013\u00a0T)</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>130\u00a0+\u00a020</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>100\u00a0+\u00a050</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the theory of Ricardian equivalence?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the concept of rationality have to do with Ricardian equivalence?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nExplain whether or not you agree with the premise of the Ricardian equivalence theory that rational people might reason: \u201cWell, a higher budget deficit (surplus) means that I\u2019m just going to owe more (less) taxes in the future to pay off all that government borrowing, so I\u2019ll start saving (spending) now.\u201d Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nIllustrate the concept of Ricardian equivalence using the demand and supply of financial capital graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\nRicardian equivalence\n: the theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing\n^\n\ntwin deficits\n: deficits that occur when a country is running both a trade and a budget deficit", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

As [The Keynesian Perspective](/m48749){: .target-chapter} chapter discusses, a net inflow of foreign financial investment always accompanies a trade deficit, while a net outflow of financial investment always accompanies a trade surplus. One way to understand the connection from budget deficits to trade deficits is that when government creates a budget deficit with some combination of tax cuts or spending increases, it will increase aggregate demand in the economy, and some of that increase in aggregate demand will result in a higher level of imports. A higher level of imports, with exports remaining fixed, will cause a larger trade deficit. That means foreigners\u2019 holdings of dollars increase as Americans purchase more imported goods. Foreigners use those dollars to invest in the United States, which leads to an inflow of foreign investment. One possible source of funding our budget deficit is foreigners buying Treasury securities that are sold by the U.S. government. So a budget deficit is often accompanied by a trade deficit.\n\n### Twin Deficits?\n\nIn the mid-1980s, it was common to hear economists and even newspaper articles refer to the twin deficits, as the budget deficit and trade deficit both grew substantially. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C31_007) shows the pattern. The federal budget deficit went from 2.6% of GDP in 1981 to 5.1% of GDP in 1985\u2014a drop of 2.5% of GDP. Over that time, the trade deficit moved from 0.5% in 1981 to 2.9% in 1985\u2014a drop of 2.4% of GDP. In the mid-1980s, the considerable increase in government borrowing was matched by an inflow of foreign investment capital, so the government budget deficit and the trade deficit moved together.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C31_007 data-title=\"U.S. Budget Deficits and Trade Deficits \"}\n\nOf course, no one should expect the budget deficit and trade deficit to move in lockstep, because the other parts of the national saving and investment identity\u2014investment and private savings\u2014will often change as well. In the late 1990s, for example, the government budget balance turned from deficit to surplus, but the trade deficit remained large and growing. During this time, the inflow of foreign financial investment was supporting a surge of physical capital investment by U.S. firms. In the first half of the 2000s, the budget and trade deficits again increased together, but in 2009, the budget deficit increased while the trade deficit declined. The budget deficit and the trade deficits are related to each other, but they are more like cousins than twins.\n\n### Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates\n\nExchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C31_008) shows a situation using the **exchange rate**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} for the U.S. dollar, measured in euros. At the original equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>), where the demand for U.S. dollars (D<sub>0</sub>) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars (S<sub>0</sub>) on the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $100 billion per day (which was roughly the quantity of dollar\u2013euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid-2000s). Then the U.S. budget deficit rises and foreign financial investment provides the source of funds for that budget deficit.\n\nInternational financial investors, as a group, will demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets to purchase the U.S. government bonds, and they will supply fewer of the U.S. dollars that they already hold in these markets. Demand for U.S. dollars on the foreign exchange market shifts from D<sub>0</sub> to D<sub>1</sub> and the supply of U.S. dollars falls from S<sub>0</sub> to S<sub>1</sub>. At the new equilibrium (E<sub>1</sub>), the exchange rate has appreciated to 1.05 euros per dollar while, in this example, the quantity of dollars traded remains the same.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C31_008 data-title=\"Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates \"}\n\nA stronger exchange rate, of course, makes it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods abroad while making imports cheaper, so a trade deficit (or a reduced trade surplus) results. Thus, a budget deficit can easily result in an inflow of foreign financial capital, a stronger exchange rate, and a trade deficit.\n\nYou can also imagine this appreciation of the exchange rate as being driven by interest rates. As explained earlier in [Budget Deficits and Interest Rates in Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth](/m48807#CNX_Econ_C31_004), a budget deficit increases demand in markets for domestic financial capital, raising the domestic interest rate. A higher interest rate will attract an inflow of foreign financial capital, and appreciate the exchange rate in response to the increase in demand for U.S. dollars by foreign investors and a decrease in supply of U. S. dollars. Because of higher interest rates in the United States, Americans find U.S. bonds more attractive than foreign bonds. When Americans are buying fewer foreign bonds, they are supplying fewer U.S. dollars. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar leads to a larger trade deficit (or reduced surplus). The connections between inflows of foreign investment capital, interest rates, and exchange rates are all just different ways of drawing the same economic connections: a larger budget deficit can result in a larger trade deficit, although the connection should not be expected to be one-to-one.\n\n### From Budget Deficits to International Economic Crisis\n\nThe economic story of how an outflow of international financial capital can cause a deep recession is laid out, step-by-step, in the [Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows](/m48776){: .target-chapter} chapter. When international financial investors decide to withdraw their funds from a country like Turkey, they increase the supply of the Turkish lira and reduce the demand for lira, depreciating the lira exchange rate. When firms and the government in a country like Turkey borrow money in international financial markets, they typically do so in stages. First, banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros, then convert those U.S. dollars to lira, and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey. If the value of the lira exchange rate depreciates, then Turkey\u2019s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros.\n\nThe combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand, which causes a deep **recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years: along with Turkey in 2002, this general pattern was followed by Mexico in 1995, Thailand and countries across East Asia in 1997\u20131998, Russia in 1998, and Argentina in 2002. In many of these countries, large government budget deficits played a role in setting the stage for the financial crisis. A moderate increase in a budget deficit that leads to a moderate increase in a trade deficit and a moderate appreciation of the exchange rate is not necessarily a cause for concern. But beyond some point that is hard to define in advance, a series of large budget deficits can become a cause for concern among international investors.\n\nOne reason for concern is that extremely large budget deficits mean that aggregate demand may shift so far to the right as to cause high inflation. The example of Turkey is a situation where very large budget deficits brought inflation rates well into double digits. In addition, very large budget deficits at some point begin to raise a fear that the borrowing will not be repaid. In the last 175 years, the government of Turkey has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans six times. Brazil\u2019s government has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans seven times; Venezuela, nine times; and Argentina, five times. The risk of high inflation or a default on repaying international loans will worry international investors, since both factors imply that the rate of return on their investments in that country may end up lower than expected. If international investors start withdrawing the funds from a country rapidly, the scenario of less investment, a depreciated exchange rate, widespread bank failure, and deep recession can occur. The following Clear It Up feature explains other impacts of large deficits.\n\n\n\nWhat are the risks of chronic large deficits in the United States?\n\nIf a government runs large budget deficits for a sustained period of time, what can go wrong? According to a recent report by the Brookings Institution, a key risk of a large budget deficit is that government debt may grow too high compared to the country\u2019s GDP growth. As debt grows, the national savings rate will decline, leaving less available in financial capital for private investment. The impact of chronically large budget deficits is as follows:\n\n* As the population ages, there will be an increasing demand for government services that may cause higher government deficits. Government borrowing and its interest payments will pull resources away from domestic investment in human capital and physical capital that is essential to economic growth.\n* Interest rates may start to rise so that the cost of financing government debt will rise as well, creating pressure on the government to reduce its budget deficits through spending cuts and tax increases. These steps will be politically painful, and they will also have a contractionary effect on aggregate demand in the economy.\n* Rising percentage of debt to GDP will create uncertainty in the financial and global markets that might cause a country to resort to inflationary tactics to reduce the real value of the debt outstanding. This will decrease real wealth and damage confidence in the country\u2019s ability to manage its spending. After all, if the government has borrowed at a fixed interest rate of, say, 5%, and it lets inflation rise above that 5%, then it will effectively be able to repay its debt at a negative real interest rate.\n\nThe conventional reasoning suggests that the relationship between sustained deficits that lead to high levels of government debt and long-term growth is negative. How significant this relationship is, how big an issue it is compared to other macroeconomic issues, and the direction of causality, is less clear.\n\nWhat remains important to acknowledge is that the relationship between debt and growth is negative and that for some countries, the relationship may be stronger than in others. It is also important to acknowledge the direction of causality: does high debt cause slow growth, slow growth cause high debt, or are both high debt and slow growth the result of third factors? In our analysis, we have argued simply that high debt causes slow growth. There may be more to this debate than we have space to discuss here.\n\n\n\n### Using Fiscal Policy to Address Trade Imbalances\n\nIf a nation is experiencing the inflow of foreign investment capital associated with a trade deficit because foreign investors are making long-term direct investments in firms, there may be no substantial reason for concern. After all, many low-income nations around the world would welcome direct investment by multinational firms that ties them more closely into the global networks of production and distribution of goods and services. In this case, the inflows of foreign investment capital and the trade deficit are attracted by the opportunities for a good rate of return on private sector investment in an economy.\n\nHowever, governments should beware of a sustained pattern of high budget deficits and high trade deficits. The danger arises in particular when the inflow of foreign investment capital is not funding long-term physical capital investment by firms, but instead is short-term portfolio investment in government bonds. When inflows of foreign financial investment reach high levels, foreign financial investors will be on the alert for any reason to fear that the country\u2019s exchange rate may decline or the government may be unable to repay what it has borrowed on time. Just as a few falling rocks can trigger an avalanche; a relatively small piece of bad news about an economy can trigger an enormous outflow of short-term financial capital.\n\nReducing a nation\u2019s budget deficit will not always be a successful method of reducing its trade deficit, because other elements of the national saving and investment identity, like private saving or investment, may change instead. In those cases when the budget deficit is the main cause of the trade deficit, governments should take steps to reduce their budget deficits, lest they make their economy vulnerable to a rapid outflow of international financial capital that could bring a deep recession.\n\n\n\nFinancing Higher Education\n\nOver the period between 1982 and 2012, the increases in the cost of a college education had far outpaced that of the income of the typical American family. According to the research done by the President Obama\u2019s staff, the cost of education at a four-year public college increased by 257% compared to an increase in family incomes of only 16% over the prior 30 years. The ongoing debate over a balanced budget and proposed cutbacks accentuated the need to increase investment in human capital to grow the economy versus deepening the already significant debt levels of the U.S. government. In the summer of 2013, President Obama presented a plan to make college more affordable that included increasing Pell Grant awards and the number of recipients, caps on interest rates for student loans, and providing education tax credits. In addition, the plan includes an accountability method for institutions of higher education that focuses on completion rates and creates a College Scorecard. Whether or not all these initiatives come to fruition remains to be seen, but they are indicative of creative approaches that government can take to meet its obligation from both a public and fiscal policy perspective.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe government need not balance its budget every year. However, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits over time risks causing several negative macroeconomic outcomes: a shift to the right in aggregate demand that causes an inflationary increase in the price level; crowding out private investment in physical capital in a way that slows down economic growth; and creating a dependence on inflows of international portfolio investment which can sometimes turn into outflows of foreign financial investment that can be injurious to a macroeconomy.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, the U.S. government moved from a budget deficit to a budget surplus and the trade deficit in the U.S. economy grew substantially. Using the national saving and investment identity, what can you say about the direction in which saving and/or investment must have changed in this economy?\n\n\n\nIn this case, the national saving and investment identity is written in this way:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Quantity\u00a0supplied\u00a0of\u00a0financial\u00a0capital</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Quantity\u00a0demanded\u00a0of\u00a0financial\u00a0capital</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>(T\u00a0\u2013\u00a0G)\u00a0+\u00a0(M\u00a0\u2013\u00a0X)\u00a0+\u00a0S</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>I</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nThe increase in the government budget surplus and the increase in the trade deficit both increased the supply of financial capital. If investment in physical capital remained unchanged, then private savings must go down, and if savings remained unchanged, then investment must go up.

The Tanzanian parliament has decided that it will spend 10 million shillings on schools, roads, and healthcare for the year. You estimate that the net taxes for the year are eight million shillings. The difference will be financed by selling 10-year government bonds at 12% interest per year. The interest on outstanding bonds must be added to government expenditure each year. Assume that additional taxes are added to finance this increase in government expenditure so the gap between government spending is always two million. If the school, road, and healthcare budget are unchanged, compute the value of the accumulated debt in 10 years.\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nThe White House. \u201cThis is why it\\'s time to make college more affordable.\u201d Last modified August 20, 2013. http://www.whitehouse.gov/share/college-affordability.\n\nRubin, Robert E., Peter R.

He had high hopes for the future. Like many young South Africans, however, he had difficulty finding a job. \u201cI was just stuck at home waiting, waiting for something to come up,\u201d he said in a BBC interview in 2012. In South Africa 54.6% of young females and 47.2% of males are unemployed. In fact, the problem is not limited to South Africa. Seventy-three million of the world\u2019s youth aged 15 to 24 are currently unemployed, according to the International Labour Organization.\n\nAccording to the *Wall Street Journal,* in India, 60% of the labor force is self-employed, largely because of labor market regulation. A recent World Development Report by The World Bank says that India\u2019s unemployed youth accounted for 9.9% of the youth work force in 2010. In Spain (a far richer country) in the same year, the female/male youth unemployment rate was 39.8% and 43.2% respectively.\n\nYouth unemployment is a significant issue in many parts of the world. However, despite the apparent similarities in rates between South Africa, Spain, and India, macroeconomic policy solutions to decrease youth unemployment in these three countries are different. This chapter will look at macroeconomic policies around the world, specifically those related to reducing unemployment, promoting economic growth, and stable inflation and exchange rates. Then we will look again at the three cases of South Africa, Spain, and India.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Macroeconomic Policy around the World\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* The Diversity of Countries and Economies across the World\n* Improving Countries\u2019 Standards of Living\n* Causes of Unemployment around the World\n* Causes of Inflation in Various Countries and Regions\n* Balance of Trade Concerns\n\n\n\nThere are extraordinary differences in the composition and performance of economies across the world. What explains these differences? Are countries motivated by similar goals when it comes to macroeconomic policy? Can we apply the same macroeconomic framework developed in this text to understand the performance of these countries? Let\u2019s take each of these questions in turn.\n\n*Explaining differences*\\: Recall from [Unemployment](/m48719){: .target-chapter} that we explained the difference in composition and performance of economies by appealing to an aggregate production function. We argued that the diversity of average incomes across the world was explained by differences in productivity, which in turn were affected by inputs such as capital deepening, human capital, and \u201ctechnology.\u201d Every economy has its own distinctive economic characteristics, institutions, history, and political realities, which imply that access to these \u201cingredients\u201d will vary by country and so will economic performance.\n\nFor example, South Korea invested heavily in education and technology to increase agricultural productivity in the early 1950s. Some of this investment came from its historical relationship with the United States. As a result of these and many other institutions, its economy has managed to converge to the levels of income in leading economies like Japan and the United States.\n\n*Similar goals and frameworks*\\: Many economies that have performed well in terms of per capita income have\u2014for better or worse\u2014been motivated by a similar goal: to maintain the quality of life of their citizens. Quality of life is a broad term, but as you can imagine it includes but is not limited to such things as low level of unemployment, price stability (low levels of inflation), and the ability to trade. These seem to be universal macroeconomic goals as discussed in [The Macroeconomic Perspective](/m48705){: .target-chapter}. No country would argue against them. To study macroeconomic policy around the world, we begin by comparing standards of living. In keeping with these goals, we also look at indicators such as unemployment, inflation, and the balance of trade policies across countries. Remember that every country has had a diverse set of experiences; therefore although our goals may be similar, each country may well require macroeconomic policies tailored to its circumstances.\n\n\nFor more reading on the topic of youth unemployment, visit this [website][1] to read \u201cGeneration Jobless\u201d in the *Economist*.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/genjobless", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48812", "module_title": "Economics - m48812", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48812", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Analyze GDP per capita as a measure of the diversity of international standards of living\n* Identify what classifies a country as low-income, middle-income, or high-income\n* Explain how standards of living are influenced by geography, demographics, industry structure, and economic institutions\n\n\n\nThe national economies that make up the global economy are remarkably diverse. Let us use one key indicator of the standard of living, **GDP per capita**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, to quantify this diversity. You will quickly see that quantifying this diversity is fraught with challenges and limitations. As explained in [The Macroeconomic Perspective](/m48705){: .target-chapter}, we must consider using **purchasing power parity**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} or \u201cinternational dollars\u201d to convert average incomes into comparable units. Purchasing power parity, as formally defined in [Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows](/m48776){: .target-chapter}, takes into account the fact that prices of the same good are different across countries.\n\n[The Macroeconomic Perspective](/m48705){: .target-chapter} explained how to measure GDP, the challenges of using GDP to compare standards of living, and the difficulty of confusing economic size with distribution. In China\\'s case, for example, China ranks as the second largest global economy, second to only the United States, with Japan being third. But, when we take China\\'s GDP of $9.2 trillion and divide it by its population of 1.4 billion, then the per capita GDP is only $6,900, which is significantly lower than that of Japan, at $38,500, and that of the United States, at $52,800. Measurement issues aside, it\u2019s worth repeating that the goal, then, is to not only increase GDP, but to strive toward increased GDP per capita to increase overall standards of living for individuals. As we have learned from [Economic Growth](/m48713){: .target-chapter}, this can be achieved at the national level by designing policies that increase worker productivity, deepen capital, and advance technology.\n\nGDP per capita also allows us to rank countries into high-, middle-, or low-income groups. Low-income countries are those with $1,025 per capita GDP per year; middle-income countries have a per capita GDP between $1,025 and $12,475; while high-income countries have over $12,475 per year per capita income. As seen in [\\[link\\]](#Ch32Mod01Tab01) and [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C32_002), high-income countries earn 68% of world income, but represent just 12% of the global population. Low-income countries earn 1% of total world income, but represent 18.5% of global population.\n\n<table id=\"Ch32Mod01Tab01\" summary=\"This table has five columns and four rows.

In turn, people in the high-income nations of the world, such as those who live in the European Union nations or North America, have a per capita GDP three to four times that of the people of Latin America. To put things in perspective, North America and the European Union have slightly more than 9% of the world\u2019s population, but they produce and consume close to 70% of the world\u2019s GDP.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C32_003 data-title=\"GDP Per Capita in U.S. Dollars (2008)\"}\n\n<table id=\"Ch32Mod01Tab02\" summary=\"This table has three columns and six rows.

After all, per capita GDP cannot fully capture the quality of life. Many other factors have a large impact on the standard of living, like health, education, human rights, crime and personal safety, and environmental quality. These measures also reveal very wide differences in the standard of living across the regions of the world. Much of this is correlated with per capita income, but there are exceptions. For example, life expectancy at birth in many low-income regions approximates those who are more affluent. The data also illustrate that nobody can claim to have perfect **standards of living**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. For instance, despite very high income levels, there is still undernourishment in Europe and North America.\n\n\nEconomists know that there are many factors that contribute to your standard of living. People in high-income countries may have very little time due to heavy workloads and may feel disconnected from their community. Lower-income countries may be more community centered, but have little in the way of material wealth. It is hard to measure these characteristics of standard of living. The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development has developed the \u201cOECD Better Life Index.\u201d Visit this [website][1] to see how countries measure up to your expected standard of living.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"Ch32Mod01QR01\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nThe differences in economic statistics and other measures of well-being, substantial though they are, do not fully capture the reasons for the enormous differences between countries. Aside from the **neoclassical determinants of growth**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, four additional determinants are significant in a wide range of statistical studies and are worth mentioning: geography, demography, industrial structure, and institutions.\n\n**Geographic and Demographic Differences**\n\nCountries have geographic differences: some have extensive coastlines, some are landlocked. Some have large rivers that have been a path of commerce for centuries, or mountains that have been a barrier to trade. Some have deserts, some have rain forests. These differences create different positive and negative opportunities for commerce, health, and the environment.\n\nCountries also have considerable differences in the age distribution of the population. Many high-income nations are approaching a situation by 2020 or so in which the elderly will form a much larger share of the population. Most low-income countries still have a higher proportion of youth and young adults, but by about 2050, the elderly populations in these low-income countries are expected to boom as well. These demographic changes will have considerable impact on the standard of living of the young and the old.\n\n**Differences in Industry Structure and Economic Institutions**\n\nCountries have differences in industry structure. In the high-income economies of the world, only about 2% of GDP comes from agriculture; the average for the rest of the world is 12%. Countries have strong differences in degree of urbanization.\n\nCountries also have strong differences in economic institutions: some nations have economies that are extremely market-oriented, while other nations have command economies. Some nations are open to international trade, while others use tariffs and import quotas to limit the impact of trade. Some nations are torn by long-standing armed conflicts; other nations are largely at peace. There are differences in political, religious, and social institutions as well.\n\nNo nation intentionally aims for a low standard of living, high rates of unemployment and inflation, or an unsustainable trade imbalance. However, nations will differ in their priorities and in the situations in which they find themselves, and so their policy choices can reasonably vary, too. The next modules will discuss how nations around the world, from high income to low income, approach the four macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low unemployment, low inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#Ch32Mod01_summ}\n\nMacroeconomic policy goals for most countries strive toward low levels of unemployment and inflation, as well as stable trade balances. Countries are analyzed based on their GDP per person and ranked as low-, middle-, and high-income countries. Low-income are those earning less than $1,025 (less than 1%) of global income. They currently have 18.5% of the world population. Middle-income countries are those with per capital income of $1,025\u2013$12,475 (31.1% of global income). They have 69.5% of world population. High-income countries are those with per capita income greater than $12,475 (68.3% of global income). They have 12% of the world\u2019s population. Regional comparisons tend to be inaccurate because even countries within those regions tend to differ from each other.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#Ch32Mod01_sques}\n\n\n\nUsing the data provided in [[link]](#Ch32Mod01Tab03), rank the seven regions of the world according to GDP and then according to GDP per capita.\n\n<table id=\"Ch32Mod01Tab03\" summary=\"The table shows the GDP and population of six regions of the world.

Aggregating per capita real GDP will vary widely across countries within a region, so aggregating data for a region has little meaning. For example, if you were to compare per capital real GDP for the United States, Canada, Haiti, and Honduras, it looks much different than if you looked at the same data for North America as a whole. Thus, regional comparisons are broad-based and may not adequately capture an individual country\u2019s economic attributes.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#Ch32Mod01_rques}\n\n\n\nWhat is the primary way in which economists measure standards of living?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the other ways of comparing the standard of living in countries around the world?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the four other factors that determine the economic standard of living around the world?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question   {#Ch32Mod01_ctques}\n\n\n\nDemography can have important economic effects.

According to most economists who believe in the **growth consensus**{: data-type=\"term\"}, economic growth (as discussed in [Economic Growth](/m48713){: .target-chapter}) is built on a foundation of productivity improvements. In turn, productivity increases are the result of greater human and physical capital and technology, all interacting in a market-driven economy. In the pursuit of economic growth, however, some countries and regions start from different levels, as illustrated by the differences in per capita GDP presented earlier in [\\[link\\]](/m48812#Ch32Mod01Tab02).\n\n### Growth Policies for the High-Income Countries   {#Ch32Mod02_01}\n\nFor the high-income countries, the challenge of economic growth is to push continually for a more educated workforce that can create, invest in, and apply new technologies. In effect, the goal of their growth-oriented public policy is to shift their aggregate supply curves to the right (refer to [The Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model](/m48739)). The main public policies targeted at achieving this goal are fiscal policies focused on investment, including investment in human capital, in technology, and in physical plant and equipment. These countries also recognize that economic growth works best in a stable and market-oriented economic climate. For this reason, they use monetary policy to keep inflation low and stable, and to minimize the risk of exchange rate fluctuations, while also encouraging domestic and international competition.\n\nHowever, early in the second decade of the 2000s, many high-income countries found themselves more focused on the short term than on the long term. The United States, Western Europe, and Japan all experienced a combination of financial crisis and deep recession, and the after-effects of the recession\u2014like high unemployment rates\u2014seemed likely to linger for several years. Most of these governments took aggressive, and in some cases controversial, steps to jump-start their economies by running very large budget deficits as part of expansionary fiscal policy. These countries must adopt a course that combines lower government spending and higher taxes.\n\nSimilarly, many central banks ran highly expansionary monetary policies, with both near-zero interest rates and unconventional loans and investments. For example, in 2012, Shinzo Abe (see [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C32_007)), then newly-elected Prime Minister of Japan, unveiled a plan to get his country out of its two-decade-long slump in economic growth. It included both fiscal stimulus and an increase in the money supply. The plan was quite successful in the short run. However, according to the *Economist*, with public debt \u201cexpected to approach 240% of GDP,\u201d (as of 2012 it was 226% of GDP) printing money and public-works spending were only short-term solutions.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C32_007 data-title=\"Japan&#x2019;s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe\"}\n\nAs other chapters discuss, macroeconomics needs to have both a short-run and a long-run focus. The challenge for many of the developed countries in the next few years will be to exit from the short-term policies that were used to correct the 2008\u20132009 recession. Since the return to growth has been sluggish, it has been politically challenging for these governments to refocus their efforts on new technology, education, and physical capital investment.\n\n### Growth Policies for the Middle-Income Economies   {#Ch32Mod02_02}\n\nThe world\u2019s great economic success stories in the last few decades began in the 1970s with that group of nations sometimes known as the **East Asian Tigers**{: data-type=\"term\"}\\: South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. The list sometimes includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, although these are often treated under international law as part of China, rather than as separate countries. The economic growth of the Tigers has been phenomenal, typically averaging 5.5% real per capita growth for several decades. In the 1980s, other countries began to show signs of convergence. China began growing rapidly, often at annual rates of 8% to 10% per year. India began growing rapidly, first at rates of about 5% per year in the 1990s, but then higher still in the first decade of the 2000s.\n\nThe underlying causes of these rapid growth rates are known:\n\n* China and the East Asian Tigers, in particular, have been among the highest savers in the world, often saving one-third or more of GDP as compared to the roughly one-fifth of GDP, which would be a more typical saving rate in Latin America and Africa. These higher savings were harnessed for domestic investment to build physical capital.\n* These countries had policies that supported heavy investments in human capital, first building up primary-level education and then expanding secondary-level education. Many focused on encouraging math and science education, which is useful in engineering and business.\n* Governments made a concerted effort to seek out applicable technology, by sending students and government commissions abroad to look at the most efficient industrial operations elsewhere. They also created policies to support innovative companies that wished to build production facilities to take advantage of the abundant and inexpensive human capital.\n* China and India in particular also allowed far greater freedom for market forces, both within their own domestic economies and also in encouraging their firms to participate in world markets.\n\nThis combination of **technology**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, **human capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, and **physical capital**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, combined with the incentives of a market-oriented economic context, proved an extremely powerful stimulant to growth. Challenges faced by these middle-income countries are a legacy of government economic controls that for political reasons can be dismantled only slowly over time. In many of them, the banking and financial sector is heavily regulated. Governments have also sometimes selected certain industries to receive low-interest loans or government subsidies. These economies have found that an increased dose of market-oriented incentives for firms and workers has been a critical ingredient in the recipe for faster growth. To learn more about measuring economic growth, read the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\nWhat is the rule of 72?\n\nIt is worth pausing a moment to marvel at the growth rates of the East Asian Tigers. If per capita GDP grows at, say, 6% per year, then you can apply the formula for compound growth rates\u2014that is (1 + 0.06)<sup>30</sup>\u2014meaning a nation\u2019s level of per capita GDP will rise by a multiple of almost six over 30 years. Another strategy is to apply the rule of 72. The rule of 72 is an approximation to figure out doubling time. The rule number, 72, is divided by the annual growth rate to obtain the approximate number of years it will take for income to double. So if we have a 6% growth rate, it will take 72/6, or 12 years, for incomes to double. Using this rule here suggests that a Tiger that grows at 6% will double its GDP every 12 years. In contrast, a technological leader, chugging along with per capita growth rates of about 2% per year, would double its income in 36 years.\n\n\n\n### Growth Policies for Economically-Challenged Countries   {#Ch32Mod02_03}\n\nMany economically-challenged or low-income countries are geographically located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Other pockets of low income are found in the former Soviet Bloc, and in parts of Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nThere are macroeconomic policies and prescriptions that might alleviate the extreme poverty and low standard of living. However, many of these countries lack the economic and legal stability, along with market-oriented institutions, needed to provide a fertile climate for domestic economic growth and to attract foreign investment. Thus, macroeconomic policies for low income economies are vastly different from those of the high income economies. The World Bank has made it a priority to combat poverty and raise overall income levels through 2030. One of the key obstacles to achieving this is the political instability that seems to be a common feature of low-income countries.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C32_004) shows the ten lowest income countries as ranked by The World Bank in 2013. These countries share some common traits, the most significant of which is the recent failures of their governments to provide a legal framework for economic growth. Ethiopia and Eritrea recently ended a long-standing war in 2000. Civil and ethnic wars have plagued countries such as Burundi and Liberia. Command economies, corruption, as well as political factionalism and infighting are commonly adopted elements in these low-income countries. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (often referred to as \u201cCongo\u201d) is a resource-wealthy country that has not been able to increase its subsistence standard of living due to the political environment.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C32_004 data-title=\"The Ten Lowest Income Countries\"}\n\nLow-income countries are at a disadvantage because any incomes received are spent immediately on necessities such as food. People in these countries live on less than $1,035 per year, which is less than $100 per month. Lack of saving means a lack of capital accumulation and a lack of loanable funds for investment in physical and human capital. Recent research by two MIT economists, **Abhijit Bannerjee**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **Esther Duflo**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, has confirmed that the households in these economies are trapped in low incomes because they cannot muster enough investment to push themselves out of poverty.\n\nFor example, the average citizen of Burundi, the lowest-income country, subsists on $150 per year (adjusted to 2005 dollars). According to data collected by the Central Intelligence Agency in its CIA Factbook, as of 2013, 90% of Burundi\u2019s population is agrarian, with coffee and tea as the main income producing crop. Only one in two children attends school and, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C32_005), many are not in schools comparable to what is found in developed countries. The CIA Factbook also estimates that 15% of Burundi\u2019s population suffers from HIV/AIDS. Political instability has made it difficult for Burundi to make significant headway toward growth, as verified by the electrification of only 2% of households and 42% of its national income coming from foreign aid.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C32_005 data-title=\"Lack of Funds for Investing in Human Capital\"}\n\n\nThe World Factbook [website][1] is loaded with maps, flags, and other information about countries across the globe.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"Ch32Mod02QR01\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nOther low-income countries share similar stories. These countries have found it difficult to generate investments for themselves or to find foreign investors willing to put up the money for more than the basic needs. Foreign aid and external investment comprise significant portions of the income in these economies, but are not sufficient to allow for the capital accumulation necessary to invest in physical and human capital. But is foreign aid always a contributor to economic growth? It can be a controversial issue, as the next Clear it Up feature points out.\n\n\n\nDoes foreign aid to low-income countries work?\n\nAccording to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), about $134 billion per year in foreign aid flows from the high-income countries of the world to the low-income ones. Relative to the size of their populations or economies, this is not a large amount for either donors or recipients. For low-income countries, aid averages about 1.3 percent of their GDP. But even this relatively small amount has been highly controversial.\n\nSupporters of additional foreign aid point to the extraordinary human suffering in the low-and middle-income countries of the world. They see opportunities all across Africa, Asia, and Latin America to set up health clinics and schools. They want to help with the task of building economic infrastructure: clean water, plumbing, electricity, and roads. Supporters of this aid include formal state-sponsored institutions like the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) or independent non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like CARE International that also receive donor government funds. For example, because of an outbreak of meningitis in Ethiopia in 2010, DFID channeled significant funds to the Ethiopian Ministry of Health to train rural health care workers and also for vaccines. These monies helped the Ministry offset shortfalls in their budget.\n\nOpponents of increased aid do not quarrel with the goal of reducing human suffering, but they suggest that foreign aid has often proved a poor tool for advancing that goal. For example, according to an article in the *Attach\u00e9 Journal of International Affairs*, the Canadian foreign aid organization (CIDA) provided $100 million to Tanzania to grow wheat. The project did produce wheat, but nomadic pastoralists and other villagers who had lived on the land were driven off 100,000 acres of land to make way for the project. The damage in terms of human rights and lost livelihoods was significant. Villagers were beaten and killed because some refused to leave the land. At times, the unintended collateral damage from foreign aid can be significant.\n\nWilliam Easterly, professor of economics at New York University and author of *The White Man\u2019s Burden*, argues that aid is often given for political reasons and ends up doing more harm than good. If the government of a country creates a reasonably stable and market-oriented macroeconomic climate, then foreign investors will be likely to provide funds for many profitable activities. For example, according to *The New York Times*, Facebook is partnering with multiple organizations in a project called Internet.org to provide access in remote and low-income areas of the world, and Google began its own initiative called Project Loon. Facebook\u2019s first forays into providing Internet access via mobile phones began in stable, market-oriented countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, and the Philippines.\n\nPolicymakers are now wiser about the limitations of foreign aid than they were a few decades ago. In targeted and specific cases, especially if foreign aid is channeled to long-term investment projects, foreign aid can have a modest role to play in reducing the extreme levels of deprivation experienced by hundreds of millions of people around the world.\n\n\n\n\nWatch this [video][2] on the complexities of providing economic aid in Africa.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" id=\"Ch32Mod02QR02\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#Ch32Mod02_summ}\n\nThe fundamentals of growth are the same in every country: improvements in human capital, physical capital, and technology interacting in a market-oriented economy. Countries that are high-income tend to focus on developing and using new technology. Countries that are middle-income focus on increasing human capital and becoming more connected to technology and global markets. They have charted unconventional paths by relying more on state-led support rather than relying solely on markets. Low-income, economically-challenged countries have many health and human development needs, but they are also challenged by the lack of investment and foreign aid to develop infrastructure like roads. There are some bright spots when it comes to financial development and mobile communications, which suggest that low-income countries can become technology leaders in their own right, but it is too early to claim victory. These countries must do more to connect to the rest of the global economy and find the technologies that work best for them.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#Ch32Mod02_sques}\n\n\n\nCreate a table that identifies the macroeconomic policies for a high-income country, a middle-income country, and a low-income country.\n\n\n\nThe following table provides a summary of possible answers.\n\n<table id=\"Ch32Mod02Tab01\" summary=\"The table shows potential macroeconomic policies for a high-income country, a middle-income country, and a low-income country.

{"module_id": "m48814", "module_title": "Economics - m48814", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48814", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Explain the nature and causes of unemployment\n* Analyze the natural rate of unemployment and the factors that affect it\n* Identify how undeveloped labor markets can result in the same hardships as unemployment\n\n\n\nThe causes of unemployment in high-income countries of the world can be categorized in two ways: either cyclical unemployment caused by the economy being in a recession, or the natural rate of unemployment caused by factors in labor markets, such as government regulations regarding hiring and starting businesses.\n\n### Unemployment from a Recession   {#Ch32Mod03_01}\n\nFor **unemployment**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} caused by a recession, the **Keynesian economic model**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} points out that both monetary and fiscal policy tools are available. The monetary policy prescription for dealing with recession is straightforward: run an **expansionary monetary policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} to increase the quantity of money and loans, drive down interest rates, and increase **aggregate demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. In a **recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, there is usually relatively little danger of inflation taking off, and so even a central bank, with fighting inflation as its top priority, can usually justify some reduction in interest rates.\n\nWith regard to **fiscal policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the **automatic stabilizers**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} discussed in [Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy](/m48791){: .target-chapter} should be allowed to work, even if this means larger budget deficits in times of recession. There is less agreement over whether, in addition to automatic stabilizers, governments in a recession should try to adopt **discretionary fiscal policy**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of additional tax cuts or spending increases. In the case of the Great Recession, the case for this kind of extra-aggressive expansionary fiscal policy is stronger, but for a smaller recession, given the time lags of implementing fiscal policy, discretionary fiscal policy should be used with caution.\n\nHowever, the aftermath of the Recession emphasizes that expansionary fiscal and monetary policies do not turn off a recession like flipping a switch turns off a lamp. Even after a recession is officially over, and positive growth has returned, it can take some months\u2014or even a couple of years\u2014before private-sector firms believe the economic climate is healthy enough that they can expand their workforce.\n\n### The Natural Rate of Unemployment   {#Ch32Mod03_02}\n\nUnemployment rates in the nations of Europe have typically been higher than in the United States. In 2006, before the start of the **Great Recession**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the U.S. unemployment rate was 4.6%, compared with 9% in France, 10.4% in Germany, and 7.1% in Sweden. The pattern of generally higher unemployment rates in Europe, which dates back to the 1970s, is typically attributed to the fact that European economies have a higher natural rate of unemployment because they have a greater number of rules and restrictions that discourage firms from hiring and unemployed workers from taking jobs.\n\nAddressing the natural rate of unemployment is straightforward in theory but difficult in practice. Government can play a useful role in providing unemployment and welfare payments, passing rules about where and when businesses can operate, assuring that the workplace is safe, and so on. But these well-intentioned laws can, in some cases, become so intrusive that businesses decide to place limits on their hiring.\n\nFor example, a law that imposes large costs on a business that tries to fire or lay off workers will mean that businesses try to avoid hiring in the first place, as is the case in France. According to *Business Week*, \u201cFrance has 2.4 times as many companies with 49 employees as with 50 ... according to the French labor code, once a company has at least 50 employees inside France, management must create three worker councils, introduce profit sharing, and submit restructuring plans to the councils if the company decides to fire workers for economic reasons.\u201d This labor law essentially limits employment (or raises the natural rate of unemployment).\n\n### Undeveloped Labor Markets   {#Ch32Mod03_03}\n\nLow-income and middle-income countries face employment issues that go beyond unemployment as it is understood in the high-income economies. A substantial number of workers in these economies provide many of their own needs by farming, fishing, or hunting. They barter and trade with others and may take a succession of short-term or one-day jobs, sometimes being paid with food or shelter, sometimes with money. They are not \u201cunemployed\u201d in the sense that the term is used in the United States and Europe, but neither are they employed in a regular wage-paying job.\n\nThe starting point of economic activity, as discussed in [Welcome to Economics!](/m48590){: .target-chapter}, is the division of labor, in which workers specialize in certain tasks and trade the fruits of their labor with others. Workers who are not connected to a labor market are often unable to specialize very much. Because these workers are not \u201cofficially\u201d employed, they are often not eligible for social benefits like unemployment insurance or old-age payments\u2014if such payments are even available in their country. Helping these workers to become more connected to the labor market and the economy is an important policy goal. Indeed, recent research by development economists suggests that one of the key factors in raising people in low-income countries out of the worst kind of poverty is whether they can make a connection to a somewhat regular wage-paying job.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#Ch32Mod03_summ}\n\nCyclical unemployment can be addressed by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy. The natural rate of unemployment can be harder to deal with, because it involves thinking carefully about the tradeoffs involved in laws that affect employment and hiring. Unemployment is understood differently in high-income countries compared to low- and middle-income countries.

First, whatever happens with aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the short run, monetary policy can be used to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched in the economy in the medium and long term. Second, there is no long-run gain to letting inflation become established. In fact, allowing inflation to become lasting and persistent poses undesirable risks and tradeoffs. When inflation is high, businesses and individuals need to spend time and effort worrying about protecting themselves against inflation, rather than seeking out better ways to serve customers. In short, the high-income economies appear to have both a political consensus to hold inflation low and the economic tools to do so.\n\nIn a number of middle- and low-income economies around the world, inflation is far from a solved problem. In the early 2000s, Turkey experienced inflation of more than 50% per year for several years. Belarus had inflation of about 100% per year from 2000 to 2001. From 2008 to 2010, Venezuela and Myanmar had inflation rates of 20% to 30% per year. Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine all had double-digit inflation for most of the years from 2000 to 2010. Zimbabwe had hyperinflation, with inflation rates that went from more than 100% per year in the mid-2000s to a rate of several million percent in 2008.\n\nIn these countries, the problem of very high inflation generally arises from huge budget deficits, which are financed by the government printing its domestic currency. This is a case of \u201ctoo much money chasing too few goods.\u201d In the case of Zimbabwe, the government covered its widening deficits by printing ever higher currency notes, including a $100 trillion bill. By late 2008, the money was nearly worthless, which led Zimbabwe to adopt the U.S. dollar, immediately halting their hyperinflation. In some countries, the central bank makes loans to politically favored firms, essentially printing money to do so, and this too leads to higher inflation.\n\nA number of countries have managed to sustain solid levels of economic growth for sustained periods of time with levels of inflation that would sound high by recent U.S. standards, like 10% to 30% per year. In such economies, most contracts, wage levels, and interest rates are indexed to inflation. Indexing wage contracts and interest rates means that they will increase when inflation increases to retain purchasing power. When wages do not rise as price levels rise, this leads to a decline in the real wage rate and a decrease in the standard of living. Likewise, interest rates that are not indexed mean that the lenders of money will be paid back in devalued currency and will also lose purchasing power on monies that were lent. It is clearly possible\u2014and perhaps sometimes necessary\u2014for a **converging economy**{: data-type=\"term\"} (the economy of a country that demonstrates the ability to catch up to the technology leaders) to live with a degree of uncertainty over inflation that would be politically unacceptable in the high-income economies.\n\n###  Concepts and Summary   {#Ch32Mod04_summ}\n\nMost high-income economies have learned that their central banks can control inflation in the medium and the long term. In addition, they have learned that inflation has no long-term benefits but potentially substantial long-term costs if it distracts businesses from focusing on real productivity gains. However, smaller economies around the world may face more volatile inflation because their smaller economies can be unsettled by international movements of capital and goods.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#Ch32Mod04_sques}\n\n\n\nHow does indexing wage contracts to inflation help workers?\n\n\n\nIndexing wage contracts means wages rise when prices rise. This means what you can buy with your wages, your standard of living, remains the same. When wages are not indexed, or rise with inflation, your standard of living falls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the AD/AS model to show how increases in government spending can lead to more inflation.\n\n\n\nAn increase in government spending shifts the AD curve to the right, raising both income and price levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow, using the AD/AS model, how monetary policy can be used to decrease the price level.\n\n\n\nA decrease in the money supply will shift the AD curve leftward and reduce income and price levels. Banks will have less money to lend. Interest rates will increase, affecting consumption and investment, which are both key determinants of aggregate demand.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#Ch32Mod04_rques}\n\n\n\nIs inflation likely to be a severe problem for at least some high-income economies in the near future?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs inflation likely to be a problem for at least some low- and middle-income economies in the near future?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions   {#Ch32Mod04_ctques}\n\n\n\nWhy are inflationary dangers lower in the high-income economies than in low-income and middle-income economies?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems   {#Ch32Mod04_prob}\n\n\n\nRetrieve inflation data from The World Bank data base (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx) for India, Spain, and South Africa for 2008\u20132013.

{"module_id": "m48816", "module_title": "Economics - m48816", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48816", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n* Explain the meaning of trade balance and its implications for the foreign exchange market\n* Analyze concerns over international trade in goods and services and international flows of capital\n* Identify and evaluate market-oriented economic reforms\n\n\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, and even into the 1970s, openness to global flows of goods, services, and financial capital was often viewed in a negative light by low- and middle-income countries. These countries feared that foreign trade would mean both economic losses as their economy was \u201cexploited\u201d by high-income trading partners and a loss of domestic political control to powerful business interests and multinational corporations.\n\nThese negative feelings about international trade have evolved. After all, the great economic success stories of recent years like Japan, the East Asian Tiger economies, China, and India, all took advantage of opportunities to sell in global markets. The economies of Europe thrive with high levels of trade. In the **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, the United States, Canada, and Mexico pledged themselves to reduce trade barriers. Many countries have clearly learned that reducing barriers to trade is at least potentially beneficial to the economy. Indeed, many smaller economies of the world have learned an even tougher lesson: if they do not participate actively in world trade, they are unlikely to join the success stories among the converging economies. There are no examples in world history of small economies that remained apart from the global economy but still attained a high standard of living.\n\nAlthough almost every country now claims that its goal is to participate in global trade, the possible negative consequences have remained highly controversial. It is useful to divide up these possible negative consequences into issues involving trade of goods and services and issues involving flows of international capital. These issues are related, but not the same. An economy may have a high level of trade in goods and services relative to GDP, but if exports and imports are balanced, the net flow of foreign investment in and out of the economy will be zero. Conversely, an economy may have only a moderate level of trade relative to GDP, but find that it has a substantial current account trade imbalance. Thus, it is useful to consider the concerns over international trade of goods and services and international flows of financial capital separately.\n\n### Concerns over International Trade in Goods and Services   {#Ch32Mod05_01}\n\nThere is a long list of worries about foreign trade in goods and services: fear of job loss, environmental dangers, unfair labor practices, and many other concerns. These arguments are discussed at some length in [The International Trade and Capital Flows](/m48731){: .target-chapter}.\n\nOf all of the arguments for limitations on trade, perhaps the most controversial one among economists is the **infant industry argument**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}; that is, subsidizing or protecting new industries for a time until they become established. ([Globalization and Protectionism](/m48824){: .target-chapter} explains this concept in more detail.) Such policies have been used with some success at certain points in time, but in the world as a whole, support for key industries is far more often directed at long-established industries with substantial political power that are suffering losses and laying off workers, rather than potentially vibrant new industries that have yet to be established. If government is going to favor certain industries, it needs to do so in a way that is temporary and that orients them toward a future of market competition, rather than a future of unending government subsidies and trade protection.\n\n### Concerns over International Flows of Capital   {#Ch32Mod05_02}\n\nRecall from [The Macroeconomic Perspective](/m48705){: .target-chapter} that a **trade deficit**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} exists when a nation\u2019s imports exceed its exports. In order for a trade deficit to take place, foreign countries must provide loans or investments, which they are willing to do because they expect they will be repaid eventually (that the deficit will become a surplus). A **trade surplus**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, you may remember, exists when a nation\u2019s exports exceed its imports. So, in order for a trade deficit to switch to a trade surplus, a nation\u2019s exports must rise and its imports must fall. Sometimes this happens when the currency decreases in value. For example, if the U.S. had a trade deficit and the dollar depreciated, imports would become more expensive. This would, in turn, benefit the foreign countries who provided the loans or investments.\n\nThe expected pattern of trade imbalances in the world economy has been that high-income economies will run trade surpluses, which means they will experience a net outflow of capital to foreign destinations or export more than they import, while low- and middle-income economies will run trade deficits, which means that they will experience a net inflow of foreign capital.\n\nThis pattern of international investing can benefit all sides. Investors in the high-income countries benefit because they can receive high returns on their investments, and also because they can diversify their investments so that they are at less risk of a downturn in their own domestic economy. The low-income economies that receive an inflow of capital presumably have potential for rapid catch-up economic growth, and they can use the inflow of international financial capital to help spur their physical capital investment. In addition, inflows of financial capital often come with management abilities, technological expertise, and training.\n\nHowever, for the last couple of decades, this cheerful scenario has faced two \u201cdark clouds.\u201d The first cloud is the very large trade or current account deficits in the U.S. economy. (See [The International Trade and Capital Flows](/m48731){: .target-chapter}.) Instead of offering net financial investment abroad, the U.S. economy is soaking up savings from all over the world. These substantial U.S. trade deficits may not be sustainable according to **Sebastian Edwards**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} writing for the **National Bureau of Economic Research**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. While trade deficits on their own are not bad, the question is whether they will be reduced gradually or hastily. In the gradual scenario, U.S. exports could grow more rapidly than imports over a period of years, aided by a depreciation of the U.S. dollar. An unintended consequence of the slow growth since the Great Recession has been a decline in the size of the U.S. current account deficit from 6% pre-recession to 3% most recently.\n\nThe other option is that the U.S. trade deficit could be reduced in a rush. Here is one scenario: if foreign investors became less willing to hold U.S. dollar assets, the dollar exchange rate could weaken. As speculators see this process happening, they might rush to unload their dollar assets, which would drive the dollar down still further.\n\nA lower U.S. dollar would stimulate aggregate demand by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive. It would mean higher prices for imported inputs throughout the economy, shifting the short-term aggregate supply curve to the left. The result could be a burst of inflation and, if the **Federal Reserve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} were to run a tight monetary policy to reduce the inflation, it could also lead to recession. People sometimes talk as if the U.S. economy, with its great size, is invulnerable to this sort of pressure from international markets. While it is tough to rock, it is not impossible for the $17 trillion U.S. economy to face these international pressures.\n\nThe second \u201cdark cloud\u201d is how the smaller economies of the world should deal with the possibility of sudden inflows and outflows of foreign financial capital. Perhaps the most vivid recent example of the potentially destructive forces of international capital movements occurred in the economies of the East Asian Tigers in 1997\u20131998. Thanks to their excellent growth performance over the previous few decades, these economies had attracted considerable interest from foreign investors. In the mid-1990s, however, foreign investment into these countries surged even further. Much of this money was funneled through banks that borrowed in U.S. dollars and loaned in their national currencies. Bank lending surged at rates of 20% per year or more. This inflow of foreign capital meant that investment in these economies exceeded the level of domestic savings, so that current account deficits in these countries jumped into the range of 5\u201310% of GDP.\n\nThe surge in bank lending meant that many banks in these East Asian countries did not do an especially good job of screening out safe and unsafe borrowers. Many of the loans\u2014as high as 10% to 15% of all loans in some of these countries\u2014started to turn bad. Fearing losses, foreign investors started pulling their money out. As the foreign money left, the exchange rates of these countries crashed, often falling by 50% or more in a few months. The banks were stuck with a mismatch: even if the rest of their domestic loans were repaid, they could never pay back the U.S. dollars that they owed. The banking sector as a whole went bankrupt. The lack of credit and lending in the economy collapsed aggregate demand, bringing on a deep recession.\n\nIf the flow and ebb of international capital markets can flip even the economies of the East Asian Tigers, with their stellar growth records, into a recession, then it is no wonder that other middle- and low-income countries around the world are concerned. Moreover, similar episodes of an inflow and then an outflow of foreign financial capital have rocked a number of economies around the world: for example, in the last few years, economies like Ireland, Iceland, and Greece have all experienced severe shocks when foreign lenders decided to stop extending funds. Especially in Greece, this caused the government to enact austerity measures which led to protests throughout the country ([\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C32_008)).\n\n  cutting wages and increasing taxes on its population. Massive protests are but one byproduct. (Credit: modification of work by Apostolos/Flickr Creative Commons)\"){: #CNX_Econ_C32_008 data-title=\"Protests in Greece\"}\n\nMany nations are taking steps to reduce the risk that their economy will be injured if foreign financial capital takes flight, including having their central banks hold large reserves of foreign exchange and stepping up their regulation of domestic banks to avoid a wave of imprudent lending. The most controversial steps in this area involve whether countries should try to take steps to control or reduce the flows of foreign capital. If a country could discourage some of the inflow of speculative short-term capital, and instead only encourage investment capital that was committed for the medium term and the long term, then it could be at least somewhat less susceptible to swings in the sentiments of global investors.\n\nIf economies participate in the global trade of goods and services, they will also need to participate in international flows of financial payments and investments. These linkages can offer great benefits to an economy. However, any nation that is experiencing a substantial and sustained pattern of trade deficits, along with the corresponding net inflow of international financial capital, has some reason for concern. During the **Asian Financial Crisis**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} in the late 1990s, countries that grew dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis as international capital flowed in, saw their economies collapse when the capital very quickly flowed out.\n\n### Market-Oriented Economic Reforms   {#Ch32Mod05_03}\n\nThe standard of living has increased dramatically for billions of people around the world in the last half century. Such increases have occurred not only in the technological leaders like the United States, Canada, the nations of Europe, and Japan, but also in the East Asian Tigers and in many nations of Latin America and Eastern Europe. The challenge for most of these countries is to maintain these growth rates. The economically-challenged regions of the world have stagnated and become stuck in poverty traps. These countries need to focus on the basics: health and education, or human capital development. As [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C32_006) illustrates, modern technology allows for the investment in education and human capital development in ways that would have not been possible just a few short years ago.\n\n\"){: #CNX_Econ_C32_006 data-title=\"Solar-powered Technology\"}\n\nOther than the issue of economic growth, the other three main goals of macroeconomic policy\u2014that is, low unemployment, low inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade\u2014all involve situations in which, for some reason, the economy fails to coordinate the forces of supply and demand. In the case of cyclical unemployment, for example, the intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of output below potential GDP. In the case of the natural rate of unemployment, government regulations create a situation where otherwise-willing employers become unwilling to hire otherwise-willing workers. Inflation is a situation in which aggregate demand outstrips aggregate supply, at least for a time, so that too much buying power is chasing too few goods. A trade imbalance is a situation where, because of a net inflow or outflow of foreign capital, domestic savings are not aligned with domestic investment. Each of these situations can create a range of easier or harder policy choices.\n\n\n\nYouth Unemployment: Three Cases\n\nSpain and South Africa had the same high youth unemployment in 2011, but the reasons for this unemployment are different. Spain\u2019s youth unemployment surged due to the Great Recession of 2008\u20132009 and heavy indebtedness on the part of its citizens and its government. Spain\u2019s current account balance is negative, which means it is borrowing heavily. To cure cyclical unemployment during a recession, the Keynesian model suggests increases in government spending\u2014fiscal expansion or monetary expansion. Neither option is open to Spain. It currently can borrow at only high interest rates, which will be a real problem in terms of debt service. In addition, the rest of the European Union (EU) has dragged its feet when it comes to debt forgiveness. Monetary expansion is not possible because Spain uses the euro and cannot devalue its currency unless it convinces all of the EU to do so. So what can be done? The *Economist*, summarizing some of the ideas of economists and policymakers, suggests that Spain\u2019s only realistic (although painful) option is to reduce government-mandated wages, which would allow it to reduce government spending. As a result, the government would be able to lower tax rates on the working population. With a lower wage or lower tax environment, firms will hire more workers. This will lower unemployment and stimulate the economy. Spain can also encourage greater foreign investment and try to promote policies that encourage domestic savings.\n\nSouth Africa has more of a natural rate of unemployment problem. It is an interesting case because its youth unemployment is mostly due to the fact that its young are not ready to work. This is commonly referred to as an employability problem. According to interviews of South African firms as reported in the *Economist*, the young are academically smart but lack practical skills for the workplace. Despite a big push to increase investment in human capital, the results have not yet borne fruit. Recently the government unveiled a plan to pay unemployed youth while they were \u201ctrained-up\u201d or apprenticed in South African firms. The government has room to increase fiscal expenditure, encourage domestic savings, and continue to fund investment in education, vocational training, and apprentice programs. South Africa can also improve the climate for foreign investment from technology leaders, which would encourage economic growth.\n\nIndia has a smaller youth employment problem in terms of percentages. However, bear in mind that since this is a populous country, it turns out to be a significant problem in raw numbers. According to Kaushik Basu, writing for the BBC, \u201cthere are 45 national laws governing the hiring and firing decisions of firms and close to four times that amount at the state level\u201d. These laws make it difficult for companies to fire workers. To stay nimble and responsive to markets, Indian companies respond to these laws by hiring fewer workers. The Indian government can do much to solve this problem by adjusting its labor laws. Essentially, the government has to remove itself from firms\u2019 hiring and firing decisions, so that growing Indian firms can freely employ more workers. Indian workers, like those in South Africa, do not have workforce skills. Again, the government can increase its spending on education, vocational training, and workforce readiness programs.\n\nFinally, India has a significant current account deficit. This deficit is mainly a result of short- and long-term capital flows. To solve this deficit, India has experimented by lifting the limitation on domestic savers from investing abroad. This is a step in the right direction that may dampen the growth in the current account deficit. A final policy possibility is to improve domestic capital markets so many self-employed Indians can get access to capital to realize their business ideas. If more Indians can get access to capital to start businesses, employment might increase.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary   {#Ch32Mod05_summ}\n\nThere are many legitimate concerns over possible negative consequences of free trade. Perhaps the single strongest response to these concerns is that there are good ways to address them without restricting trade and thus losing its benefits. There are two major issues involving trade imbalances. One is what will happen with the large U.S. trade deficits, and whether they will come down gradually or with a rush. The other is whether smaller countries around the world should take some steps to limit flows of international capital, in the hope that they will not be quite so susceptible to economic whiplash from international financial capital flowing in and out of their economies.\n\n### Self-Check Questions   {#Ch32Mod05_sques}\n\n\n\nWhat do international flows of capital have to do with trade imbalances?\n\n\n\nGiven the high level of activity in international financial markets, it is typically believed that financial flows across borders are the real reason for trade imbalances. For example, the United States had an enormous trade deficit in the late 1990s and early 2000s because it was attracting vast inflows of foreign capital. Smaller countries that have attracted such inflows of international capital worry that if the inflows suddenly turn to outflows, the resulting decline in their currency could collapse their banking system and bring on a deep recession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the demand-and-supply of foreign currency graph to determine what would happen to a small, open economy that experienced capital outflows.\n\n\n\nThe demand for the country\u2019s currency would decrease, lowering the exchange rate.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions   {#Ch32Mod05_rques}\n\n\n\nWhat are the major issues with regard to trade imbalances for the U.S. economy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the major issues with regard to trade imbalances for low- and middle-income countries?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Question   {#Ch32Mod05_ctques}\n\n\n\nExplain why converging economies may present a strong argument for limiting flows of capital but not for limiting trade.\n\n\n\n\n### References   {#Ch32Mod05_ref}\n\nEdwards, S.

That means, that Samsung is both the biggest supplier and biggest competitor for Apple. Why do these two firms work together to produce the iPhone? To understand the economic logic behind international trade, you have to accept, as these firms do, that trade is about mutually beneficial exchange. Samsung is one of the world\u2019s largest electronics parts suppliers. Apple lets Samsung focus on making the best parts, which allows Apple to concentrate on its strength\u2014designing elegant products that are easy to use. If each company (and by extension each country) focuses on what it does best, there will be gains for all through trade.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to International Trade\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Absolute and Comparative Advantage\n* What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods\n* Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies\n* The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade\n\n\n\nWe live in a global marketplace. The food on your table might include fresh fruit from Chile, cheese from France, and bottled water from Scotland. Your wireless phone might have been made in Taiwan or Korea. The clothes you wear might be designed in Italy and manufactured in China. The toys you give to a child might have come from India. The car you drive might come from Japan, Germany, or Korea. The gasoline in the tank might be refined from crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, or Nigeria. As a worker, if your job is involved with farming, machinery, airplanes, cars, scientific instruments, or many other technology-related industries, the odds are good that a hearty proportion of the sales of your employer\u2014and hence the money that pays your salary\u2014comes from export sales. We are all linked by international trade, and the volume of that trade has grown dramatically in the last few decades.\n\nThe first wave of **globalization**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} started in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I. Over that time, global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1% of GDP in 1820 to 9% of GDP in 1913. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman of Princeton University wrote in 1995:\n\n<q>It is a late-twentieth-century conceit that we invented the global economy just yesterday. In fact, world markets achieved an impressive degree of integration during the second half of the nineteenth century. Indeed, if one wants a specific date for the beginning of a truly global economy, one might well choose 1869, the year in which both the Suez Canal and the Union Pacific railroad were completed. By the eve of the First World War steamships and railroads had created markets for standardized commodities, like wheat and wool, that were fully global in their reach. Even the global flow of information was better than modern observers, focused on electronic technology, tend to realize: the first submarine telegraph cable was laid under the Atlantic in 1858, and by 1900 all of the world\u2019s major economic regions could effectively communicate instantaneously.</q>\n\nThis first wave of globalization crashed to a halt in the beginning of the twentieth century. World War I severed many economic connections. During the **Great Depression**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of the 1930s, many nations misguidedly tried to fix their own economies by reducing foreign trade with others. World War II further hindered international trade. Global flows of goods and financial capital rebuilt themselves only slowly after World War II. It was not until the early 1980s that global economic forces again became as important, relative to the size of the world economy, as they were before World War I.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

The evidence that international trade confers overall benefits on economies is pretty strong. Trade has accompanied economic growth in the United States and around the world. Many of the national economies that have shown the most rapid growth in the last few decades\u2014for example, Japan, South Korea, China, and India\u2014have done so by dramatically orienting their economies toward international trade. There is no modern example of a country that has shut itself off from world trade and yet prospered. To understand the benefits of trade, or why we trade in the first place, we need to understand the concepts of comparative and absolute advantage.\n\nIn 1817, **David Ricardo**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, a businessman, economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a treatise called *On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation*. In this treatise, Ricardo argued that specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners, even those that may be relatively inefficient. To see what he meant, we must be able to distinguish between absolute and comparative advantage.\n\nA country has an **absolute advantage**{: data-type=\"term\"} in producing a good over another country if it uses fewer resources to produce that good. Absolute advantage can be the result of a country\u2019s natural endowment. For example, extracting oil in Saudi Arabia is pretty much just a matter of \u201cdrilling a hole.\u201d Producing oil in other countries can require considerable exploration and costly technologies for drilling and extraction\u2014if indeed they have any oil at all. The United States has some of the richest farmland in the world, making it easier to grow corn and wheat than in many other countries. Guatemala and Colombia have climates especially suited for growing coffee. Chile and Zambia have some of the world\u2019s richest copper mines. As some have argued, \u201cgeography is destiny.\u201d Chile will provide copper and Guatemala will produce coffee, and they will trade. When each country has a product others need and it can be produced with fewer resources in one country over another, then it is easy to imagine all parties benefitting from trade. However, thinking about trade just in terms of geography and absolute advantage is incomplete. Trade really occurs because of comparative advantage.\n\nRecall from the chapter [Choice in a World of Scarcity](/m48602){: .target-chapter} that a country has a **comparative advantage**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods. The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this: \u201cWhat do we give up to produce this good?\u201d It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of **opportunity cost**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} from [Choice in a World of Scarcity](/m48602){: .target-chapter}. For example, if Zambia focuses its resources on producing copper, its labor, land and financial resources cannot be used to produce other goods such as corn. As a result, Zambia gives up the opportunity to produce corn. How do we quantify the cost in terms of other goods? Simplify the problem and assume that Zambia just needs labor to produce copper and corn. The companies that produce either copper or corn tell you that it takes 10 hours to mine a ton of copper and 20 hours to harvest a bushel of corn. This means the opportunity cost of producing a ton of copper is 2 bushels of corn. The next section develops absolute and comparative advantage in greater detail and relates them to trade.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] for a list of articles and podcasts pertaining to international trade topics.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### A Numerical Example of Absolute and Comparative Advantage\n\nConsider a hypothetical world with two countries, Saudi Arabia and the United States, and two products, oil and corn. Further assume that consumers in both countries desire both these goods. These goods are homogeneous, meaning that consumers/producers cannot differentiate between corn or oil from either country. There is only one resource available in both countries, labor hours. Saudi Arabia can produce oil with fewer resources, while the United States can produce corn with fewer resources. [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_01) illustrates the advantages of the two countries, expressed in terms of how many hours it takes to produce one unit of each good.\n\n<table id=\"Table_33_01\" summary=\"This table is has three rows and three columns.

We illustrate what each country is capable of producing on its own using a **production possibility frontier (PPF)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} graph, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C33_010).

(b) If the United States produces only oil, it can produce, at maximum, 50 barrels and zero corn (point A'), or at the other extreme, it can produce a maximum of 100 bushels of corn and no oil (point B').

Thus, before trade, the Saudi Arabian economy will devote 60 worker hours to produce oil, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_03). Given the information in [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_01), this choice implies that it produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil.

Using all its resources, the United States can produce 50 barrels of oil *or* 100 bushels of corn. So the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn\u2014or the slope is 1/2. Thus, in the U.S. production possibility frontier graph, every increase in oil production of one barrel implies a decrease of two bushels of corn. Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil *or* 25 bushels of corn. The opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil is the loss of 1/4 of a bushel of corn that Saudi workers could otherwise have produced. In terms of corn, notice that Saudi Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil.

The United States gives up the least to produce a bushel of corn, so it has a comparative advantage in corn production.\n\nIn this example, there is symmetry between absolute and comparative advantage. Saudi Arabia needs fewer worker hours to produce oil (absolute advantage, see [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_01)), and also gives up the least in terms of other goods to produce oil (comparative advantage, see [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_04)). Such symmetry is not always the case, as we will show after we have discussed gains from trade fully. But first, read the following Clear It Up feature to make sure you understand why the PPF line in the graphs is straight.\n\n\n\nCan a production possibility frontier be straight?\n\nWhen you first met the production possibility frontier (PPF) in the chapter on [Choice in a World of Scarcity](/m48602){: .target-chapter} it was drawn with an outward-bending shape. This shape illustrated that as inputs were transferred from producing one good to another\u2014like from education to health services\u2014there were increasing opportunity costs. In the examples in this chapter, the PPFs are drawn as straight lines, which means that opportunity costs are constant. When a marginal unit of labor is transferred away from growing corn and toward producing oil, the decline in the quantity of corn and the increase in the quantity of oil is always the same. In reality this is possible only if the contribution of additional workers to output did not change as the scale of production changed. The linear production possibilities frontier is a less realistic model, but a straight line simplifies calculations. It also illustrates economic themes like absolute and comparative advantage just as clearly.\n\n\n\n### Gains from Trade\n\nConsider the trading positions of the United States and Saudi Arabia after they have specialized and traded. Before trade, Saudi Arabia produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil and 10 bushels of corn. The United States produces/consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn. Given their current production levels, if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels, it will **gain from trade**{: data-type=\"term\"}. With trade, the United States can consume more of both goods than it did without **specialization**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and trade. (Recall that the chapter [Welcome to Economics!](/m48590){: .target-chapter} defined specialization as it applies to workers and firms. Specialization is also used to describe the occurrence when a country shifts resources to focus on producing a good that offers comparative advantage.) Similarly, if Saudi Arabia can trade an amount of oil less than 60 barrels and receive in exchange an amount of corn greater than 10 bushels, it will have more of both goods than it did before specialization and trade. [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_05) illustrates the range of trades that would benefit both sides.\n\n<table id=\"Table_33_05\" summary=\"This table has three rows and two columns. The first row is a header row, and it labels each column: &#x201C;The U.S. Economy, after Specialization, Will Benefit If It:&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Saudi Arabian Economy, after Specialization, Will Benefit If It:&#x201D;.

If Saudi Arabia wishes to expand domestic production of corn in a world without international trade, then based on its opportunity costs it must give up four barrels of oil for every one additional bushel of corn. If Saudi Arabia could find a way to give up less than four barrels of oil for an additional bushel of corn (or equivalently, to receive more than one bushel of corn for four barrels of oil), it would be better off.\n\n\n\nWhat are the opportunity costs and gains from trade?\n\nThe range of trades that will benefit each country is based on the country\u2019s opportunity cost of producing each good. The United States can produce 100 bushels of corn or 50 barrels of oil. For the United States, the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn. If we divide the numbers above by 50, we get the same ratio: one barrel of oil is equivalent to two bushels of corn, or (100/50 = 2 and 50/50 = 1). In a trade with Saudi Arabia, if the United States is going to give up 100 bushels of corn in exports, it must import at least 50 barrels of oil to be just as well off. Clearly, to gain from trade it needs to be able to gain more than a half barrel of oil for its bushel of corn\u2014or why trade at all?\n\n\n\nRecall that David Ricardo argued that if each country specializes in its comparative advantage, it will benefit from trade, and total global output will increase. How can we show gains from trade as a result of comparative advantage and specialization? [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_06) shows the output assuming that each country specializes in its comparative advantage and produces no other good. This is 100% specialization. Specialization leads to an increase in total world production. (Compare the total world production in [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_03) to that in [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_06).)\n\n<table id=\"Table_33_06\" summary=\"This table has four rows and three columns.

Would there still be gains from trade? Consider another example, such as when the United States and Saudi Arabia start at C and C\\', respectively, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C33_010). Consider what occurs when trade is allowed and the United States exports 20 bushels of corn to Saudi Arabia in exchange for 20 barrels of oil.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C33_011 data-title=\"Production Possibilities Frontier in Saudi Arabia \"}\n\nStarting at point C, reduce Saudi Oil production by 20 and exchange it for 20 units of corn to reach point D (see [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C33_011)). Notice that even without 100% specialization, if the \u201ctrading price,\u201d in this case 20 barrels of oil for 20 bushels of corn, is greater than the country\u2019s opportunity cost, the Saudis will gain from trade. Indeed both countries consume more of both goods after specialized production and trade occurs.\n\n\nVisit this [website][2] for trade-related data visualizations.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA country has an absolute advantage in those products in which it has a productivity edge over other countries; it takes fewer resources to produce a product. A country has a comparative advantage when a good can be produced at a lower cost in terms of other goods. Countries that specialize based on comparative advantage gain from trade.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nTrue or False: The source of comparative advantage must be natural elements like climate and mineral deposits. Explain.\n\n\n\nFalse. Anything that leads to different levels of productivity between two economies can be a source of comparative advantage. For example, the education of workers, the knowledge base of engineers and scientists in a country, the part of a split-up value chain where they have their specialized learning, economies of scale, and other factors can all determine comparative advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil can produce 100 pounds of beef or 10 autos; in contrast the United States can produce 40 pounds of beef or 30 autos. Which country has the absolute advantage in beef? Which country has the absolute advantage in producing autos? What is the opportunity cost of producing one pound of beef in Brazil? What is the opportunity cost of producing one pound of beef in the United States?\n\n\n\nBrazil has the absolute advantage in producing beef and the United States has the absolute advantage in autos. The opportunity cost of producing one pound of beef is 1/10 of an auto; in the United States it is 3/4 of an auto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn France it takes one worker to produce one sweater, and one worker to produce one bottle of wine. In Tunisia it takes two workers to produce one sweater, and three workers to produce one bottle of wine. Who has the absolute advantage in production of sweaters? Who has the absolute advantage in the production of wine? How can you tell?\n\n\n\nIn answering questions like these, it is often helpful to begin by organizing the information in a table, such as in the following table. Notice that, in this case, the productivity of the countries is expressed in terms of how many workers it takes to produce a unit of a product.\n\n| Country | One Sweater | One Bottle of wine |\n|----------\n| France | 1 worker | 1 worker |\n| Tunisia | 2 workers | 3 workers |\n{: #Table_33_07 summary=\"This table has three rows and three columns.

You can tell because it takes France less labor to produce a unit of the good.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is absolute advantage? What is comparative advantage?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder what conditions does comparative advantage lead to gains from trade?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat factors does Paul Krugman identify that supported the expansion of international trade in the 1800s?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nAre differences in geography behind the differences in absolute advantages?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the United States not have an absolute advantage in coffee?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at [[link]](#fs-idp176454304). Compute the opportunity costs of producing sweaters and wine in both France and Tunisia. Who has the lowest opportunity cost of producing sweaters and who has the lowest opportunity cost of producing wine? Explain what it means to have a lower opportunity cost.\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nFrance and Tunisia both have Mediterranean climates that are excellent for producing/harvesting green beans and tomatoes. In France it takes two hours for each worker to harvest green beans and two hours to harvest a tomato. Tunisian workers need only one hour to harvest the tomatoes but four hours to harvest green beans. Assume there are only two workers, one in each country, and each works 40 hours a week.\n\n1.  Draw a production possibilities frontier for each country. *Hint*: Remember the production possibility frontier is the maximum that all workers can produce at a unit of time which, in this problem, is a week.\n2.  Identify which country has the absolute advantage in green beans and which country has the absolute advantage in tomatoes.\n3.  Identify which country has the comparative advantage.\n4.  How much would France have to give up in terms of tomatoes to gain from trade? How much would it have to give up in terms of green beans?\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nKrugman, Paul R. *Pop Internationalism*.

This is typical for high-income countries that often have well-educated workers, technologically advanced equipment, and the most up-to-date production processes. These high-income countries can produce all products with fewer resources than a low-income country. If the high-income country is more productive across the board, will there still be gains from trade? Good students of Ricardo understand that trade is about mutually beneficial exchange. Even when one country has an absolute advantage in all products, trade can still benefit both sides. This is because gains from trade come from specializing in one\u2019s comparative advantage.\n\n### Production Possibilities and Comparative Advantage\n\nConsider the example of trade between the United States and Mexico described in [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_08). In this example, it takes four U.S. workers to produce 1,000 pairs of shoes, but it takes five Mexican workers to do so. It takes one U.S. worker to produce 1,000 refrigerators, but it takes four Mexican workers to do so. The United States has an absolute advantage in productivity with regard to both shoes and refrigerators; that is, it takes fewer workers in the United States than in Mexico to produce both a given number of shoes and a given number of refrigerators.\n\n<table id=\"Table_33_08\" summary=\"This table has three rows and three columns.

It answers the question, \u201cHow many inputs do I need to produce shoes in Mexico?\u201d Comparative advantage asks this same question slightly differently. Instead of comparing how many workers it takes to produce a good, it asks, \u201cHow much am I giving up to produce this good in this country?\u201d Another way of looking at this is that comparative advantage identifies the good for which the producer\u2019s absolute advantage is relatively larger, or where the producer\u2019s absolute productivity disadvantage is relatively smaller. The United States can produce 1,000 shoes with four-fifths as many workers as Mexico (four versus five), but it can produce 1,000 refrigerators with only one-quarter as many workers (one versus four). So, the comparative advantage of the United States, where its absolute productivity advantage is relatively greatest, lies with refrigerators, and Mexico\u2019s comparative advantage, where its absolute productivity disadvantage is least, is in the production of shoes.\n\n### Mutually Beneficial Trade with Comparative Advantage\n\nWhen nations increase production in their area of comparative advantage and trade with each other, both countries can benefit. Again, the production possibility frontier is a useful tool to visualize this benefit.\n\nConsider a situation where the United States and Mexico each have 40 workers. For example, as [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_09) shows, if the United States divides its labor so that 40 workers are making shoes, then, since it takes four workers in the United States to make 1,000 shoes, a total of 10,000 shoes will be produced. (If four workers can make 1,000 shoes, then 40 workers will make 10,000 shoes). If the 40 workers in the United States are making refrigerators, and each worker can produce 1,000 refrigerators, then a total of 40,000 refrigerators will be produced.\n\n<table id=\"Table_33_09\" summary=\"This table has three rows and four columns.

(b) With 40 workers, Mexico can produce a maximum of 8,000 shoes and zero refrigerators, or 10,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. All other points on the production possibility line are possible combinations of the two goods that can be produced given current resources. Point A on both graphs is where the countries start producing and consuming before trade. Point B is where they end up after trade.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C33_008 data-title=\"Production Possibility Frontiers \"}\n\nLet\u2019s say that, in the situation before trade, each nation prefers to produce a combination of shoes and refrigerators that is shown at point A. [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_10) shows the output of each good for each country and the total output for the two countries.\n\n<table id=\"Table_33_10\" summary=\"This table has four rows and three columns.

For example, the United States transfers six workers away from shoes and toward producing refrigerators. As a result, U.S. production of shoes decreases by 1,500 units (6/4 \u00d7 1,000), while its production of refrigerators increases by 6,000 (that is, 6/1 \u00d7 1,000). Mexico also moves production toward its area of comparative advantage, transferring 10 workers away from refrigerators and toward production of shoes. As a result, production of refrigerators in Mexico falls by 2,500 (10/4 \u00d7 1,000), but production of shoes increases by 2,000 pairs (10/5 \u00d7 1,000). Notice that when both countries shift production toward each of their comparative advantages (what they are relatively better at), their combined production of both goods rises, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_11). The reduction of shoe production by 1,500 pairs in the United States is more than offset by the gain of 2,000 pairs of shoes in Mexico, while the reduction of 2,500 refrigerators in Mexico is more than offset by the additional 6,000 refrigerators produced in the United States.\n\n<table id=\"Table_33_11\" summary=\"This table has four rows and three columns.

Even though the United States has an absolute advantage in producing both refrigerators and shoes, it makes economic sense for it to specialize in the good for which it has a comparative advantage. The United States will export refrigerators and in return import shoes.\n\n### How Opportunity Cost Sets the Boundaries of Trade\n\nThis example shows that both parties can benefit from specializing in their comparative advantages and trading. By using the opportunity costs in this example, it is possible to identify the range of possible trades that would benefit each country.\n\nMexico started out, before specialization and trade, producing 4,000 pairs of shoes and 5,000 refrigerators (see [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C33_008) and [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_10)). Then, in the numerical example given, Mexico shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators. Thus, if Mexico can **export**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes (giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes) in exchange for **imports**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of at least 2,500 refrigerators (a gain of 2,500 refrigerators), it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade. Mexico will be unambiguously better off. Conversely, the United States started off, before specialization and trade, producing 5,000 pairs of shoes and 20,000 refrigerators. In the example, it then shifted production toward its comparative advantage, producing only 3,500 shoes but 26,000 refrigerators. If the United States can export no more than 6,000 refrigerators in exchange for imports of at least 1,500 pairs of shoes, it will be able to consume more of both goods and will be unambiguously better off.\n\nThe range of trades that can benefit both nations is shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_12). For example, a trade where the U.S. exports 4,000 refrigerators to Mexico in exchange for 1,800 pairs of shoes would benefit both sides, in the sense that both countries would be able to consume more of both goods than in a world without trade.\n\n<table id=\"Table_33_12\" summary=\"This table has three rows and two columns. The first row is a header row and it labels each column, &#x201C;The U.S. economy, after specialization, will benefit if it:&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Mexican economy, after specialization, will benefit if it:&#x201D;.

If Mexico wants to produce more refrigerators without trade, it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe production. If Mexico, instead, produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the United States, where the **opportunity cost**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of producing refrigerators is lower, Mexico can in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of refrigerators in the United States. Conversely, when the United States specializes in its comparative advantage of refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico, international trade allows the United States to take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in Mexico.\n\nThe theory of comparative advantage explains why countries trade: they have different comparative advantages. It shows that the gains from international trade result from pursuing comparative advantage and producing at a lower opportunity cost. The following Work It Out feature shows how to calculate absolute and comparative advantage and the way to apply them to a country\u2019s production.\n\n\n\nCalculating Absolute and Comparative Advantage\n\nIn Canada a worker can produce 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. In Venezuela, a worker can produce 60 barrels of oil or 30 tons of lumber.\n\n| Country | Oil (barrels) |  | Lumber (tons) |\n|----------\n| Canada | 20 | or | 40 |\n| Venezuela | 60 | or | 30 |\n{: #Table_33_13 summary=\"This table has three rows and four columns. The first row is a header row and it labels each column &#x201C;Country&#x201D;, &#x201C;Oil (barrels)&#x201D;, the third column is not labeled, and &#x201C;Lumber (tons)&#x201D;. Under the &#x201C;Country&#x201D; column are Canada and Venezuela. Under the &#x201C;Oil (barrels)&#x201D; column are the 20 and 60. Under the third, unlabeled, column are the words or and or. Under the column &#x201C;Lumber (tons)&#x201D; are the values 40 and 30.\"}\n\n1.  Who has the absolute advantage in the production of oil or lumber? How can you tell?\n2.  Which country has a comparative advantage in the production of oil?\n3.  Which country has a comparative advantage in producing lumber?\n4.  In this example, is absolute advantage the same as comparative advantage, or not?\n5.  In what product should Canada specialize? In what product should Venezuela specialize?\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\nStep 1. Make a table like [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_13).\n\nStep 2. To calculate absolute advantage, look at the larger of the numbers for each product. One worker in Canada can produce more lumber (40 tons versus 30 tons), so Canada has the absolute advantage in lumber. One worker in Venezuela can produce 60 barrels of oil compared to a worker in Canada who can produce only 20.\n\nStep 3. To calculate comparative advantage, find the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil in both countries. The country with the lowest opportunity cost has the comparative advantage. With the same labor time, Canada can produce either 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. So in effect, 20 barrels of oil is equivalent to 40 tons of lumber: 20 oil = 40 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 20 to calculate the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil in Canada. 20/20 oil = 40/20 lumber. 1 oil = 2 lumber. To produce one additional barrel of oil in Canada has an opportunity cost of 2 lumber. Calculate the same way for Venezuela: 60 oil = 30 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 60. One oil in Venezuela has an opportunity cost of 1/2 lumber. Because 1/2 lumber &lt; 2 lumber, Venezuela has the comparative advantage in producing oil.\n\nStep 4. Calculate the opportunity cost of one lumber by reversing the numbers, with lumber on the left side of the equation. In Canada, 40 lumber is equivalent in labor time to 20 barrels of oil: 40 lumber = 20 oil. Divide each side of the equation by 40. The opportunity cost of one lumber is 1/2 oil. In Venezuela, the equivalent labor time will produce 30 lumber or 60 oil: 30 lumber = 60 oil. Divide each side by 30. One lumber has an opportunity cost of two oil. Canada has the lower opportunity cost in producing lumber.\n\nStep 5. In this example, absolute advantage is the same as comparative advantage. Canada has the absolute and comparative advantage in lumber; Venezuela has the absolute and comparative advantage in oil.\n\nStep 6. Canada should specialize in what it has a relative lower opportunity cost, which is lumber, and Venezuela should specialize in oil. Canada will be exporting lumber and importing oil, and Venezuela will be exporting oil and importing lumber.\n\n\n\n### Comparative Advantage Goes Camping\n\nTo build an intuitive understanding of how comparative advantage can benefit all parties, set aside examples that involve national economies for a moment and consider the situation of a group of friends who decide to go camping together. The six friends have a wide range of skills and experiences, but one person in particular, Jethro, has done lots of camping before and is also a great athlete. Jethro has an absolute advantage in all aspects of camping: he is faster at carrying a backpack, gathering firewood, paddling a canoe, setting up tents, making a meal, and washing up. So here is the question: Because Jethro has an absolute productivity advantage in everything, should he do all the work?\n\nOf course not! Even if Jethro is willing to work like a mule while everyone else sits around, he, like most mortals, only has 24 hours in a day. If everyone sits around and waits for Jethro to do everything, not only will Jethro be an unhappy camper, but there will not be much output for his group of six friends to consume. The theory of comparative advantage suggests that everyone will benefit if they figure out their areas of comparative advantage\u2014that is, the area of camping where their productivity disadvantage is least, compared to Jethro. For example, it may be that Jethro is 80% faster at building fires and cooking meals than anyone else, but only 20% faster at gathering firewood and 10% faster at setting up tents. In that case, Jethro should focus on building fires and making meals, and others should attend to the other tasks, each according to where their productivity disadvantage is smallest. If the campers coordinate their efforts according to comparative advantage, they can all gain.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nEven when a country has high levels of productivity in all goods, it can still benefit from trade. Gains from trade come about as a result of comparative advantage. By specializing in a good that it gives up the least to produce, a country can produce more and offer that additional output for sale. If other countries specialize in the area of their comparative advantage as well and trade, the highly productive country is able to benefit from a lower opportunity cost of production in other countries.\n\n### Self-Check Question\n\n\n\nIn Germany it takes three workers to make one television and four workers to make one video camera. In Poland it takes six workers to make one television and 12 workers to make one video camera.\n\n1.  Who has the absolute advantage in the production of televisions? Who has the absolute advantage in the production of video cameras? How can you tell?\n2.  Calculate the opportunity cost of producing one additional television set in Germany and in Poland. (Your calculation may involve fractions, which is fine.) Which country has a comparative advantage in the production of televisions?\n3.  Calculate the opportunity cost of producing one video camera in Germany and in Poland. Which country has a comparative advantage in the production of video cameras?\n4.  In this example, is absolute advantage the same as comparative advantage, or not?\n5.  In what product should Germany specialize? In what product should Poland specialize?\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n(a) In Germany, it takes fewer workers to make either a television or a video camera. Germany has an absolute advantage in the production of both goods.* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n(b) Producing an additional television in Germany requires three workers. Shifting those three German workers will reduce video camera production by 3/4 of a camera. Producing an additional television set in Poland requires six workers, and shifting those workers from the other good reduces output of video cameras by 6/12 of a camera, or 1/2. Thus, the opportunity cost of producing televisions is lower in Poland, so Poland has the comparative advantage in the production of televisions. *Note*: Do not let the fractions like 3/4 of a camera or 1/2 of a video camera bother you. If either country was to expand television production by a significant amount\u2014that is, lots more than one unit\u2014then we will be talking about whole cameras and not fractional ones. You can also spot this conclusion by noticing that Poland\u2019s absolute disadvantage is relatively lower in televisions, because Poland needs twice as many workers to produce a television but three times as many to produce a video camera, so the product with the relatively lower absolute disadvantage is Poland\u2019s comparative advantage.* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n(c) Producing a video camera in Germany requires four workers, and shifting those four workers away from television production has an opportunity cost of 4/3 television sets. Producing a video camera in Poland requires 12 workers, and shifting those 12 workers away from television production has an opportunity cost of two television sets. Thus, the opportunity cost of producing video cameras is lower in Germany, and video cameras will be Germany\u2019s comparative advantage. * * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n(d) In this example, absolute advantage differs from comparative advantage. Germany has the absolute advantage in the production of both goods, but Poland has a comparative advantage in the production of televisions. (e) Germany should specialize, at least to some extent, in the production of video cameras, export video cameras, and import televisions. Conversely, Poland should specialize, at least to some extent, in the production of televisions, export televisions, and import video cameras.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nIs it possible to have a comparative advantage in the production of a good but not to have an absolute advantage?

They have poor soil, low investments in formal education and hence low-skill workers, no capital, and no natural resources to speak of. Because they have no advantage, they cannot benefit from trade.\u201d How would you respond?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at [[link]](#Table_33_10). Is there a range of trades for which there will be no gains?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou just got a job in Washington, D.C. You move into an apartment with some acquaintances. All your roommates, however, are slackers and do not clean up after themselves. You, on the other hand, can clean faster than each of them. You determine that you are 70% faster at dishes and 10% faster with vacuuming. All of these tasks have to be done daily. Which jobs should you assign to your roommates to get the most free time overall? Assume you have the same number of hours to devote to cleaning. Now, since you are faster, you seem to get done quicker than your roommate. What sorts of problems may this create? Can you imagine a trade-related analogy to this problem?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nIn Japan, one worker can make 5 tons of rubber or 80 radios. In Malaysia, one worker can make 10 tons of rubber or 40 radios.\n\n1.  Who has the absolute advantage in the production of rubber or radios? How can you tell?\n2.  Calculate the opportunity cost of producing 80 additional radios in Japan and in Malaysia. (Your calculation may involve fractions, which is fine.) Which country has a comparative advantage in the production of radios?\n3.  Calculate the opportunity cost of producing 10 additional tons of rubber in Japan and in Malaysia. Which country has a comparative advantage in producing rubber?\n4.  In this example, does each country have an absolute advantage and a comparative advantage in the same good?\n5.  In what product should Japan specialize? In what product should Malaysia specialize?\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the numbers for Canada and Venezuela from [[link]](#Table_33_13) which describes how many barrels of oil and tons of lumber the workers can produce. Use these numbers to answer the rest of this question.\n\n1.  Draw a production possibilities frontier for each country. Assume there are 100 workers in each country. Canadians and Venezuelans desire both oil and lumber. Canadians want at least 2,000 tons of lumber. Mark a point on their production possibilities where they can get at least 3,000 tons.\n2.  Assume that the Canadians specialize completely because they figured out they have a comparative advantage in lumber. They are willing to give up 1,000 tons of lumber. How much oil should they ask for in return for this lumber to be as well off as they were with no trade? How much should they ask for if they want to gain from trading with Venezuela? *Note*: We can think of this \u201cask\u201d as the relative price or trade price of lumber.\n3.  Is the Canadian \u201cask\u201d you identified in (b) also beneficial for Venezuelans? Use the production possibilities frontier graph for Venezuela to show that Venezuelans can gain from trade.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn [[link]](#fs-idm129993648), is there an \u201cask\u201d where Venezuelans may say \u201cno thank you\u201d to trading with Canada?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nBernstein, William J. *A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World*.

For example, the United States produces and exports autos and imports autos. [\\[link\\]](#Table_33_15) shows some of the largest categories of U.S. exports and imports. In all of these categories, the United States is both a substantial exporter and a substantial importer of goods from the same industry. In 2014, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the United States exported $159 billion worth of autos, and imported $327 billion worth of autos.

What can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars, computers, machinery and other products which are then shipped across the oceans to and from the United States, the European Union, and Japan? There are two reasons: (1) The **division of labor**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} leads to learning, innovation, and unique skills; and (2) economies of scale.\n\n### Gains from Specialization and Learning\n\nConsider the category of machinery, where the U.S. economy has considerable intra-industry trade. Machinery comes in many varieties, so the United States may be exporting machinery for manufacturing with wood, but importing machinery for photographic processing. The underlying reason why a country like the United States, Japan, or Germany produces one kind of machinery rather than another is usually not related to U.S., German, or Japanese firms and workers having generally higher or lower skills. It is just that, in working on very specific and particular products, firms in certain countries develop unique and different skills.\n\nSpecialization in the world economy can be very finely split. In fact, recent years have seen a trend in international trade called **splitting up the value chain**{: data-type=\"term\"}. The **value chain**{: data-type=\"term\"} describes how a good is produced in stages. As indicated in the beginning of the chapter, the production of the iPhone involves the design and engineering of the phone in the United States, parts supplied from Korea, the assembly of the parts in China, and the advertising and marketing done in the United States. Thanks in large part to improvements in communication technology, sharing information, and transportation, it has become easier to split up the value chain. Instead of production in a single large factory, all of these steps can be split up among different firms operating in different places and even different countries. Because firms split up the value chain, international trade often does not involve whole finished products like automobiles or refrigerators being traded between nations. Instead, it involves shipping more specialized goods like, say, automobile dashboards or the shelving that fits inside refrigerators. Intra-industry trade between similar countries produces economic gains because it allows workers and firms to learn and innovate on particular products\u2014and often to focus on very particular parts of the value chain.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] for some interesting information about the assembly of the iPhone.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### Economies of Scale, Competition, Variety\n\nA second broad reason that intra-industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale. The concept of **economies of scale**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, as introduced in [Cost and Industry Structure](/m48620){: .target-chapter}, means that as the scale of output goes up, average costs of production decline\u2014at least up to a point. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C33_005) illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens. The horizontal axis of the figure shows the quantity of production by a certain firm or at a certain manufacturing plant. The vertical axis measures the average cost of production. Production plant S produces a small level of output at 30 units and has an average cost of production of $30 per toaster oven. Plant M produces at a medium level of output at 50 units, and has an average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Plant L produces 150 units of output with an average cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven. Although plant V can produce 200 units of output, it still has the same unit cost as Plant L.\n\nIn this example, a small or medium plant, like S or M, will not be able to compete in the market with a large or a very large plant like L or V, because the firm that operates L or V will be able to produce and sell their output at a lower price. In this example, economies of scale operate up to point L, but beyond point L to V, the additional scale of production does not continue to reduce average costs of production.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C33_005 data-title=\"Economies of Scale \"}\n\nThe concept of economies of scale becomes especially relevant to international trade when it enables one or two large producers to supply the entire country. For example, a single large automobile factory could probably supply all the cars purchased in a smaller economy like the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given year. However, if a country has only one or two large factories producing cars, and no **international trade**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, then consumers in that country would have relatively little choice between kinds of cars (other than the color of the paint and other nonessential options). Little or no competition will exist between different car manufacturers.\n\nInternational trade provides a way to combine the lower average production costs that come from economies of scale and still have competition and variety for consumers. Large automobile factories in different countries can make and sell their products around the world. If the U.S. automobile market was made up of only General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, the level of competition and consumer choice would be quite a lot lower than when U.S. carmakers must face competition from Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, Fiat, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Volkswagen, Kia, Hyundai, BMW, Subaru, and others. Greater competition brings with it innovation and responsiveness to what consumers want. America\u2019s car producers make far better cars now than they did several decades ago, and much of the reason is competitive pressure, especially from East Asian and European carmakers.\n\n### Dynamic Comparative Advantage\n\nThe sources of gains from intra-industry trade between similar economies\u2014namely, the learning that comes from a high degree of specialization and splitting up the value chain and from economies of scale\u2014do not contradict the earlier theory of comparative advantage. Instead, they help to broaden the concept.\n\nIn intra-industry trade, the level of worker productivity is not determined by climate or geography. It is not even determined by the general level of education or skill. Instead, the level of worker productivity is determined by how firms engage in specific learning about specialized products, including taking advantage of economies of scale. In this vision, comparative advantage can be dynamic\u2014that is, it can evolve and change over time as new skills are developed and as the value chain is split up in new ways. This line of thinking also suggests that countries are not destined to have the same comparative advantage forever, but must instead be flexible in response to ongoing changes in comparative advantage.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nA large share of global trade happens between high-income economies that are quite similar in having well-educated workers and advanced technology. These countries practice intra-industry trade, in which they import and export the same products at the same time, like cars, machinery, and computers. In the case of intra-industry trade between economies with similar income levels, the gains from trade come from specialized learning in very particular tasks and from economies of scale. Splitting up the value chain means that several stages of producing a good take place in different countries around the world.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nHow can there be any economic gains for a country from both importing and exporting the same good, like cars?\n\n\n\nThere are a number of possible advantages of intra-industry trade. Both nations can take advantage of extreme specialization and learning in certain kinds of cars with certain traits, like gas-efficient cars, luxury cars, sport-utility vehicles, higher- and lower-quality cars, and so on. Moreover, nations can take advantage of economies of scale, so that large companies will compete against each other across international borders, providing the benefits of competition and variety to customers. This same argument applies to trade between U.S. states, where people often buy products made by people of other states, even though a similar product is made within the boundaries of their own state. All states\u2014and all countries\u2014can benefit from this kind of competition and trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[link]](#Table_33_16) shows how the average costs of production for semiconductors (the \u201cchips\u201d in computer memories) change as the quantity of semiconductors built at that factory increases.\n\n1.  Based on these data, sketch a curve with quantity produced on the horizontal axis and average cost of production on the vertical axis. How does the curve illustrate economies of scale?\n2.  If the equilibrium quantity of semiconductors demanded is 90,000, can this economy take full advantage of economies of scale? What about if quantity demanded is 70,000 semiconductors? 50,000 semiconductors? 30,000 semiconductors?\n3.  Explain how international trade could make it possible for even a small economy to take full advantage of economies of scale, while also benefiting from competition and the variety offered by several producers.\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_33_16\" summary=\"This table has six rows and two columns.

The following figure illustrates the average costs of production of semiconductors.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C33_009}\n\n\nThe curve illustrates economies of scale by showing that as the scale increases\u2014that is, as production at this particular factory goes up\u2014the average cost of production declines. The economies of scale exist up to an output of 40,000 semiconductors; at higher outputs, the average cost of production does not seem to decline any further.* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n(b) At any quantity demanded above 40,000, this economy can take full advantage of economies of scale; that is, it can produce at the lowest cost per unit. Indeed, if the quantity demanded was quite high, like 500,000, then there could be a number of different factories all taking full advantage of economies of scale and competing with each other. If the quantity demanded falls below 40,000, then the economy by itself, without foreign trade, cannot take full advantage of economies of scale.* * *\n{: data-type=\"newline\"}\n\n(c) The simplest answer to this question is that the small country could have a large enough factory to take full advantage of economies of scale, but then export most of the output. For semiconductors, countries like Taiwan and Korea have recently fit this description. Moreover, this country could also import semiconductors from other countries which also have large factories, thus getting the benefits of competition and variety. A slightly more complex answer is that the country can get these benefits of economies of scale without producing semiconductors, but simply by buying semiconductors made at low cost around the world. An economy, especially a smaller country, may well end up specializing and producing a few items on a large scale, but then trading those items for other items produced on a large scale, and thus gaining the benefits of economies of scale by trade, as well as by direct production.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is intra-industry trade?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the two main sources of economic gains from intra-industry trade?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is splitting up the value chain?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nDoes intra-industry trade contradict the theory of comparative advantage?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo consumers benefit from intra-industry trade?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might intra-industry trade seem surprising from the point of view of comparative advantage?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nFrom earlier chapters you will recall that technological change shifts the average cost curves. Draw a graph showing how technological change could influence intra-industry trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider two countries: South Korea and Taiwan. Taiwan can produce one million mobile phones per day at the cost of $10 per phone and South Korea can produce 50 million mobile phones at $5 per phone. Assume these phones are the same type and quality and there is only one price. What is the minimum price at which both countries will engage in trade?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. 2015. \u201cU.S. International Trade in Goods and Services: December 2014.\u201d Accessed April 13, 2015. http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/international/trade/2015/pdf/trad1214.pdf.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau.

Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and protecting against **dumping**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Traditionally, tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic, social, and cultural interests. The **World Trade Organization (WTO)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is committed to lowering barriers to trade. The world\u2019s nations meet through the WTO to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade, such as tariffs. WTO negotiations happen in \u201crounds,\u201d where all countries negotiate one agreement to encourage trade, take a year or two off, and then start negotiating a new agreement. The current round of negotiations is called the Doha Round because it was officially launched in Doha, the capital city of Qatar, in November 2001. In 2009, economists from the World Bank summarized recent research and found that the Doha round of negotiations would increase the size of the world economy by $160 billion to $385 billion per year, depending on the precise deal that ended up being negotiated.\n\nIn the context of a global economy that currently produces more than $30 trillion of goods and services each year, this amount is not huge: it is an increase of 1% or less. But before dismissing the gains from trade too quickly, it is worth remembering two points.\n\n* First, a gain of a few hundred billion dollars is enough money to deserve attention! Moreover, remember that this increase is not a one-time event; it would persist each year into the future.\n* Second, the estimate of gains may be on the low side because some of the gains from trade are not measured especially well in economic statistics. For example, it is difficult to measure the potential advantages to consumers of having a variety of products available and a greater degree of competition among producers. Perhaps the most important unmeasured factor is that trade between countries, especially when firms are splitting up the value chain of production, often involves a transfer of knowledge that can involve skills in production, technology, management, finance, and law.\n\nLow-income countries benefit more from trade than high-income countries do. In some ways, the giant U.S. economy has less need for international trade, because it can already take advantage of internal trade within its economy. However, many smaller national economies around the world, in regions like Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, have much more limited possibilities for trade inside their countries or their immediate regions. Without international trade, they may have little ability to benefit from comparative advantage, slicing up the value chain, or economies of scale. Moreover, smaller economies often have fewer competitive firms making goods within their economy, and thus firms have less pressure from other firms to provide the goods and prices that consumers want.\n\nThe economic gains from expanding international trade are measured in hundreds of billions of dollars, and the gains from international trade as a whole probably reach well into the trillions of dollars. The potential for gains from trade may be especially high among the smaller and lower-income countries of the world.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] for a list of some benefits of trade.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### From Interpersonal to International Trade\n\nMost people find it easy to believe that they, personally, would not be better off if they tried to grow and process all of their own food, to make all of their own clothes, to build their own cars and houses from scratch, and so on. Instead, we all benefit from living in economies where people and firms can specialize and trade with each other.\n\nThe benefits of trade do not stop at national boundaries, either. Earlier we explained that the division of labor could increase output for three reasons: (1) workers with different characteristics can specialize in the types of production where they have a comparative advantage; (2) firms and workers who specialize in a certain product become more productive with learning and practice; and (3) economies of scale. These three reasons apply from the individual and community level right up to the international level. If it makes sense to you that interpersonal, intercommunity, and interstate trade offer economic gains, it should make sense that international trade offers gains, too.\n\nInternational trade currently involves about $20 trillion worth of goods and services moving around the globe. Any economic force of that size, even if it confers overall benefits, is certain to cause disruption and controversy. This chapter has only made the case that trade brings economic benefits. Other chapters discuss, in detail, the public policy arguments over whether to restrict international trade.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s Apple\u2019s (Global) iPhone\n\nApple Corporation uses a global platform to produce the iPhone. Now that you understand the concept of comparative advantage, you can see why the engineering and design of the iPhone is done in the United States. The United States has built up a comparative advantage over the years in designing and marketing products, and sacrifices fewer resources to design high-tech devices relative to other countries. China has a comparative advantage in assembling the phone due to its large skilled labor force. Korea has a comparative advantage in producing components. Korea focuses its production by increasing its scale, learning better ways to produce screens and computer chips, and uses innovation to lower average costs of production. Apple, in turn, benefits because it can purchase these quality products at lower prices. Put the global assembly line together and you have the device with which we are all so familiar.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nTariffs are placed on imported goods as a way of protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and for protection against dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were used as a political tool to protect certain vested economic, social, and cultural interests. The WTO has been, and continues to be, a way for nations to meet and negotiate through barriers to trade. The gains of international trade are very large, especially for smaller countries, but are beneficial to all.\n\n### Self-Check Question\n\n\n\nIf the removal of trade barriers is so beneficial to international economic growth, why would a nation continue to restrict trade on some imported or exported products?\n\n\n\nA nation might restrict trade on imported products to protect an industry that is important for national security. For example, nation X and nation Y may be geopolitical rivals, each with ambitions of increased political and economic strength. Even if nation Y has comparative advantage in the production of missile defense systems, it is unlikely that nation Y would seek to export those goods to nation X. It is also the case that, for some nations, the production of a particular good is a key component of national identity. In Japan, the production of rice is culturally very important. It may be difficult for Japan to import rice from a nation like Vietnam, even if Vietnam has a comparative advantage in rice production.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Question\n\n\n\nAre the gains from international trade more likely to be relatively more important to large or small countries?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nIn World Trade Organization meetings, what do you think low-income countries lobby for?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might a low-income country put up barriers to trade, such as tariffs on imports?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan a nation\u2019s comparative advantage change over time? What factors would make it change?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nIf trade increases world GDP by 1% per year, what is the global impact of this increase over 10 years? How does this increase compare to the annual GDP of a country like Sri Lanka? Discuss. *Hint*: To answer this question, here are steps you may want to consider. Go to the World Development Indicators (online) published by the World Bank. Find the current level of World GDP in constant international dollars. Also, find the GDP of Sri Lanka in constant international dollars. Once you have these two numbers, compute the amount the additional increase in global incomes due to trade and compare that number to Sri Lanka\u2019s GDP.\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nWorld Trade Organization. \u201cThe Doha Round.\u201d Accessed October 2013. http://www.wto.org/english/tratop\\\\\\_e/dda\\\\\\_e/dda\\\\\\_e.htm.\n\nThe World Bank. \u201cData: World Development Indicators.\u201d Accessed October 2013. http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators.\n\n\n### Glossary\n{: data-type=\"glossary-title\"}\n\ntariffs\n: taxes that governments place on imported goods\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]: http://openstaxcollege.org/l/tradebenefits", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

While governments can limit the rise in prices of some products, they cannot control how much people want to buy or how much firms are willing to sell. The laws of demand and supply still hold. Trade policy is an example where regulations can redirect economic forces, but it cannot stop them from manifesting themselves elsewhere.\n\nFlat-panel displays, the displays for laptop computers, tablets, and flat screen televisions, are an example of such an enduring principle. In the early 1990s, the vast majority of flat-panel displays used in U.S.-manufactured laptops were imported, primarily from Japan. The small but politically powerful U.S. flat-panel-display industry filed a dumping complaint with the Commerce Department. They argued that Japanese firms were selling displays at \u201cless than fair value,\u201d which made it difficult for U.S. firms to compete. This argument for trade protection is referred to as anti-dumping. Other arguments for protection in this complaint included national security. After a preliminary determination by the Commerce Department that the Japanese firms were dumping, the U.S. International Trade Commission imposed a 63% dumping margin (or tax) on the import of flat-panel displays. Was this a successful exercise of U.S. trade policy? See what you think after reading the chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to Globalism and Protectionism\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn about:\n\n* Protectionism: An Indirect Subsidy from Consumers to Producers\n* International Trade and Its Effects on Jobs, Wages, and Working Conditions\n* Arguments in Support of Restricting Imports\n* How Trade Policy Is Enacted: Globally, Regionally, and Nationally\n* The Tradeoffs of Trade Policy\n\n\n\nThe world has become more connected on multiple levels, especially economically. In 1970, imports and exports made up 11% of U.S. GDP, while now they make up 32%. However, the United States, due to its size, is less internationally connected than most countries. For example, according to the World Bank, 97% of Botswana\u2019s economic activity is connected to trade. This chapter explores trade policy\u2014the laws and strategies a country uses to regulate international trade. This topic is not without controversy.\n\nAs the world has become more globally connected, firms and workers in high-income countries like the United States, Japan, or the nations of the European Union, perceive a competitive threat from firms in medium-income countries like Mexico, China, or South Africa, that have lower costs of living and therefore pay lower wages. Firms and workers in low-income countries fear that they will suffer if they must compete against more productive workers and advanced technology in high-income countries.\n\nOn a different tack, some environmentalists worry that multinational firms may evade environmental protection laws by moving their production to countries with loose or nonexistent pollution standards, trading a clean environment for jobs. Some politicians worry that their country may become overly dependent on key imported products, like oil, which in a time of war could threaten national security. All of these fears influence governments to reach the same basic policy conclusion: to protect national interests, whether businesses, jobs, or security, imports of foreign products should be restricted. This chapter analyzes such arguments. First, however, it is essential to learn a few key concepts and understand how the demand and supply model applies to international trade.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}
{"module_id": "m48825", "module_title": "Economics - m48825", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48825", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Explain protectionism and its three main forms\n* Analyze protectionism through concepts of demand and supply, noting its effects on equilibrium\n* Calculate the effects of trade barriers\n\n\n\nWhen a government legislates policies to reduce or block international trade it is engaging in **protectionism**{: data-type=\"term\"}. Protectionist policies often seek to shield domestic producers and domestic workers from foreign competition. Protectionism takes three main forms: tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers.\n\nRecall from [International Trade](/m48818){: .target-chapter} that **tariffs**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} are taxes imposed on imported goods and services. They make imports more expensive for consumers, discouraging imports. For example, in recent years large, flat-screen televisions imported from China have faced a 5% tariff rate.\n\nAnother way to control trade is through **import quotas**{: data-type=\"term\"}, which are numerical limitations on the quantity of products that can be imported. For instance, during the early 1980s, the Reagan Administration imposed a quota on the import of Japanese automobiles. In the 1970s, many developed countries, including the United States, found themselves with declining textile industries. Textile production does not require highly skilled workers, so producers were able to set up lower-cost factories in developing countries. In order to \u201cmanage\u201d this loss of jobs and income, the developed countries established an international Multifiber Agreement that essentially divided up the market for textile exports between importers and the remaining domestic producers. The agreement, which ran from 1974 to 2004, specified the exact quota of textile imports that each developed country would accept from each low-income country. A similar story exists for sugar imports into the United States, which are still governed by quotas.\n\n**Nontariff barriers**{: data-type=\"term\"} are all the other ways that a nation can draw up rules, regulations, inspections, and paperwork to make it more costly or difficult to import products. A rule requiring certain safety standards can limit imports just as effectively as high tariffs or low import quotas, for instance. There are also nontariff barriers in the form of \u201crules-of-origin\u201d regulations- these rules describe the \u201cMade in Country X\u201d label as the one in which the last substantial change in the product took place. A manufacturer wishing to evade import restrictions may try to change the production process so that the last big change in the product happens in his or her own country. For example, certain textiles are made in the United States, shipped to other countries, combined with textiles made in those other countries to make apparel\u2014and then re-exported back to the United States for a final assembly, to escape paying tariffs or to obtain a \u201cMade in the USA\u201d label.\n\nDespite import quotas, tariffs, and nontariff barriers, the share of apparel sold in the United States that is imported rose from about half in 1999 to about three-quarters today. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), estimated the number of U.S. jobs in textiles and apparel fell from 666,360 in 2007 to 385,240 in 2012, a 42% decline. Even more U.S. textile industry jobs would have been lost without tariffs, however, domestic jobs that are saved by import quotas come at a cost. Because textile and apparel protectionism adds to the costs of imports, consumers end up paying billions of dollars more for clothing each year.\n\nWhen the United States eliminates trade barriers in one area, consumers spend the money they save on that product elsewhere in the economy\u2014so there is no overall loss of jobs for the economy as a whole. Of course, workers in some of the poorest countries of the world who would otherwise have jobs producing textiles, would gain considerably if the United States reduced its barriers to trade in textiles. That said, there are good reasons to be wary about reducing barriers to trade. The 2012 and 2013 Bangladeshi fires in textile factories, which resulted in a horrific loss of life, present complications that our simplified analysis in the chapter will not capture.\n\nRealizing the compromises between nations that come about due to trade policy, many countries came together in 1947 to form the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). (We\u2019ll cover the GATT in more detail later in the chapter.) This agreement has since been superseded by the **World Trade Organization (WTO)**{: data-type=\"term\"}, whose membership includes about 150 nations and most of the economies of the world. It is the primary international mechanism through which nations negotiate their trade rules\u2014including rules about tariffs, quotas, and nontariff barriers. The next section examines the results of such protectionism and develops a simple model to show the impact of trade policy.\n\n### Demand and Supply Analysis of Protectionism\n\nTo the non-economist, restricting imports may appear to be nothing more than taking sales from foreign producers and giving them to domestic producers. Other factors are at work, however, because firms do not operate in a vacuum. Instead, firms sell their products either to consumers or to other firms (if they are business suppliers), who are also affected by the trade barriers. A demand and supply analysis of protectionism shows that it is not just a matter of domestic gains and foreign losses, but a policy that imposes substantial domestic costs as well.\n\nConsider two countries, Brazil and the United States, who produce sugar. Each country has a domestic supply and demand for sugar, as detailed in [\\[link\\]](#Table_34_01) and illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C34_001). In Brazil, without trade, the **equilibrium**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} price of sugar is 12 cents per pound and the equilibrium output is 30 tons. When there is no trade in the United States, the equilibrium price of sugar is 24 cents per pound and the equilibrium quantity is 80 tons. These equilibrium points are labeled with the point E.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C34_001 data-title=\"The Sugar Trade between Brazil and the United States \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_34_01\" summary=\"The table represents the sugar trade between Brazil and the United States.

As sugar is shipped from Brazil to the United States, the quantity of sugar produced in Brazil will be greater than Brazilian consumption (with the extra production being exported), and the amount produced in the United States will be less than the amount of U.S. consumption (with the extra consumption being imported). Exports to the United States will reduce the supply of sugar in Brazil, raising its price. Imports into the United States will increase the supply of sugar, lowering its price. When the price of sugar is the same in both countries, there is no incentive to trade further. As [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C34_001) shows, the equilibrium with trade occurs at a price of 16 cents per pound. At that price, the sugar farmers of Brazil supply a quantity of 40 tons, while the consumers of Brazil buy only 25 tons.\n\nThe extra 15 tons of sugar production, shown by the horizontal gap between the **demand curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and the **supply curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} in Brazil, is exported to the United States. In the United States, at a price of 16 cents, the farmers produce a quantity of 72 tons and consumers demand a quantity of 87 tons. The excess demand of 15 tons by American consumers, shown by the horizontal gap between demand and domestic supply at the price of 16 cents, is supplied by imported sugar. Free trade typically results in income distribution effects, but the key is to recognize the overall gains from trade, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C34_003). Building on the concepts outlined in [Demand and Supply](/m48628) and [Demand, Supply, and Efficiency](/m48832) in terms of consumer and producer surplus, [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C34_003) (a) shows that producers in Brazil gain by selling more sugar at a higher price, while [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C34_003) (b) shows consumers in the United States benefit from the lower price and greater availability of sugar. Consumers in Brazil are worse off (compare their no-trade consumer surplus with the free-trade consumer surplus) and U.S. producers of sugar are worse off. There are gains from trade\u2014an increase in social surplus in each country. That is, both the United States and Brazil are better off than they would be without trade. The following Clear It Up feature explains how trade policy can influence low-income countries.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C34_003 data-title=\"Free Trade of Sugar \"}\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to read more about the global sugar trade.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n\n\nWhy are there low-income countries?\n\nWhy are the poor countries of the world poor? There are a number of reasons, but one of them will surprise you: the trade policies of the high-income countries. Following is a stark review of social priorities which has been widely publicized by the international aid organization, **Oxfam International**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\n**High-income countries**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of the world\u2014primarily the United States, Canada, countries of the European Union, and Japan\u2014subsidize their domestic farmers collectively by about $360 billion per year. By contrast, the total amount of foreign aid from these same high-income countries to the poor countries of the world is about $70 billion per year, or less than 20% of the farm subsidies. Why does this matter?\n\nIt matters because the support of farmers in high-income countries is devastating to the livelihoods of farmers in **low-income countries**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Even when their climate and land are well-suited to products like cotton, rice, sugar, or milk, farmers in low-income countries find it difficult to compete. Farm **subsidies**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} in the high-income countries cause farmers in those countries to increase the amount they produce. This increase in supply drives down world prices of farm products below the costs of production. As Michael Gerson of the *Washington Post* describes it: \u201c\\[T\\]he effects in the cotton-growing regions of West Africa are dramatic . . . keep\\[ing\\] millions of Africans on the edge of malnutrition. In some of the poorest countries on Earth, cotton farmers are some of the poorest people, earning about a dollar a day. . . . Who benefits from the current system of subsidies? About 20,000 American cotton producers, with an average annual income of more than $125,000.\u201d\n\nAs if subsidies were not enough, often, the high-income countries block agricultural exports from low-income countries. In some cases, the situation gets even worse when the governments of high-income countries, having bought and paid for an excess supply of farm products, give away those products in poor countries and drive local farmers out of business altogether.\n\nFor example, shipments of excess milk from the European Union to Jamaica have caused great hardship for Jamaican dairy farmers. Shipments of excess rice from the United States to Haiti drove thousands of low-income rice farmers in Haiti out of business. The opportunity costs of protectionism are not paid just by domestic consumers, but also by foreign producers\u2014and for many agricultural products, those foreign producers are the world\u2019s poor.\n\n\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at what happens with **protectionism**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. U.S. sugar farmers are likely to argue that, if only they could be protected from sugar imported from Brazil, the United States would have higher domestic sugar production, more jobs in the sugar industry, and American sugar farmers would receive a higher price. If the United States government sets a high-enough tariff on imported sugar, or sets an import quota at zero, the result will be that the quantity of sugar traded between countries could be reduced to zero, and the prices in each country will return to the levels before trade was allowed.\n\nBlocking only some trade is also possible. Suppose that the United States passed a sugar import quota of seven tons. The United States will import no more than seven tons of sugar, which means that Brazil can export no more than seven tons of sugar to the United States. As a result, the price of sugar in the United States will be 20 cents, which is the price where the quantity demanded is seven tons greater than the domestic quantity supplied. Conversely, if Brazil can export only seven tons of sugar, then the price of sugar in Brazil will be 14 cents per pound, which is the price where the domestic quantity supplied in Brazil is seven tons greater than domestic demand.\n\nIn general, when a country sets a low or medium tariff or import quota, the equilibrium price and quantity will be somewhere between no trade and completely free trade. The following Work It Out explores the impact of these trade barriers.\n\n\n\nEffects of Trade Barriers\n\nLet\u2019s look carefully at the effects of tariffs or quotas. If the U.S. government imposes a tariff or quota sufficient to eliminate trade with Brazil, two things occur: U.S. consumers pay a higher price and therefore buy a smaller quantity of sugar. U.S. producers obtain a higher price so they sell a larger quantity of sugar. The effects of a tariff on producers and consumers in the United States can be measured using two concepts developed in [Demand, Supply, and Efficiency](/m48832)\\: **consumer surplus**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and **producer surplus**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C34_002 data-title=\"U.S. Sugar Supply and Demand \"}\n\n\nStep 1. Look at [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C34_002), which shows a hypothetical version of the demand and supply of sugar in the United States.\n\nStep 2. Note that the sugar market is in equilibrium at point A where Domestic Quantity Demanded (Qd) = Quantity Supplied (Domestic Qs + Imports from Brazil) at a price of P<sub>Trade</sub> when there is free trade.\n\nStep 3. Note, also, that imports are equal to the distance between points C and A.\n\nStep 4. Recall that consumer surplus is the value a consumer gets beyond what they paid for when they buy a product. Graphically, it is the area under a demand curve but above the price. In this case, the consumer surplus in the United States is the area of the triangle formed by the points P<sub>Trade</sub>, A, and B.\n\nStep 5. Recall, also, that producer surplus is another name for profit\u2014it is the income producers get above the cost of production, which is shown by the supply curve here. In this case, the producer surplus with trade is the area of the triangle formed by the points P<sub>trade</sub>, C, and D.\n\nStep 6. Suppose that the barriers to trade are imposed, imports are excluded, and the price rises to P<sub>NoTrade</sub>. Look what happens to producer surplus and consumer surplus. At the higher price, the domestic quantity supplied increases from Qs to Q at point E. Because producers are selling more quantity at a higher price, the producer surplus increases to the area of the triangle P<sub>NoTrade</sub>, E, and D.\n\nStep 7. Compare the areas of the two triangles and you will see the increase in the producer surplus.\n\nStep 8. Examine the consumer surplus. Consumers are now paying a higher price to get a lower quantity (Q instead of Qd). Their consumer surplus shrinks to the area of the triangle P<sub>NoTrade</sub>, E, and B.\n\nStep 9. Determine the net effect. The producer surplus increases by the area P<sub>trade</sub>, C, E, P<sub>NoTrade</sub>. The loss of consumer surplus, however, is larger. It is the area P<sub>trade</sub>, A, E, P<sub>NoTrade</sub>. In other words, consumers lose more than producers gain as a result of the trade barriers and the United States has a lower social surplus.\n\n\n\n### Who Benefits and Who Pays?\n\nUsing the demand and supply model, consider the impact of protectionism on producers and consumers in each of the two countries. For protected producers like U.S. sugar farmers, restricting imports is clearly positive. Without a need to face imported products, these producers are able to sell more, at a higher price. For consumers in the country with the protected good, in this case U.S. sugar consumers, restricting imports is clearly negative. They end up buying a lower quantity of the good and paying a higher price for what they do buy, compared to the equilibrium price and quantity without trade. The following Clear It Up feature considers why a country might outsource jobs even for a domestic product.\n\n\n\nWhy are Life Savers, an American product, not made in America?\n\nLife Savers, the hard candy with the hole in the middle, were invented in 1912 by Clarence Crane in Cleveland, Ohio. Starting in the late 1960s and for 35 years afterward, 46 billion Life Savers a year, in 200 million rolls, were produced by a plant in Holland, Michigan. But in 2002, the Kraft Company announced that the Michigan plant would be closed and Life Saver production moved across the border to Montreal, Canada.\n\nOne reason is that Canadian workers are paid slightly less, especially in healthcare and insurance costs that are not linked to employment there. Another main reason is that the United States government keeps the price of sugar high for the benefit of sugar farmers, with a combination of a government price floor program and strict quotas on imported sugar. According to the Coalition for Sugar Reform, from 2009 to 2012, the price of refined sugar in the United States ranged from 64% to 92% higher than the world price. Life Saver production uses over 100 tons of sugar each day, because the candies are 95% sugar.\n\nA number of other candy companies have also reduced U.S. production and expanded foreign production. Indeed, from 1997 to 2011, some 127,000 jobs in the sugar-using industries, or more than seven times the total employment in sugar production, were eliminated. While the candy industry is especially affected by the cost of sugar, the costs are spread more broadly. U.S. consumers pay roughly $1 billion per year in higher food prices because of elevated sugar costs. Meanwhile, sugar producers in low-income countries are driven out of business. Because of the sugar subsidies to domestic producers and the quotas on imports, they cannot sell their output profitably, or at all, in the United States market.\n\n\n\nThe fact that protectionism pushes up prices for consumers in the country enacting such protectionism is not always acknowledged openly, but it is not disputed. After all, if protectionism did not benefit domestic producers, there would not be much point in enacting such policies in the first place. Protectionism is simply a method of requiring consumers to subsidize producers. The subsidy is indirect, since it is paid by consumers through higher prices, rather than a direct subsidy paid by the government with money collected from taxpayers. But protectionism works like a subsidy, nonetheless. The American satirist Ambrose Bierce defined \u201ctariff\u201d this way in his 1911 book, *The Devil\u2019s Dictionary*\\: \u201cTariff, n. A scale of taxes on imports, designed to protect the domestic producer against the greed of his consumer.\u201d\n\nThe effect of protectionism on producers and consumers in the foreign country is complex. When an import quota is used to impose partial protectionism, the sugar producers of Brazil receive a lower price for the sugar they sell in Brazil\u2014but a higher price for the sugar they are allowed to export to the United States. Indeed, notice that some of the burden of protectionism, paid by domestic consumers, ends up in the hands of foreign producers in this case. Brazilian sugar consumers seem to benefit from U.S. protectionism, because it reduces the price of sugar that they pay. On the other hand, at least some of these Brazilian sugar consumers also work as sugar farmers, so their incomes and jobs are reduced by protectionism. Moreover, if trade between the countries vanishes, Brazilian consumers would miss out on better prices for imported goods\u2014which do not appear in our single-market example of sugar protectionism.\n\nThe effects of protectionism on foreign countries notwithstanding, protectionism requires domestic consumers of a product (consumers may include either households or other firms) to pay higher prices to benefit domestic producers of that product. In addition, when a country enacts protectionism, it loses the economic gains it would have been able to achieve through a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning, and economies of scale, concepts discussed in [International Trade](/m48818){: .target-chapter}.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThere are three tools for restricting the flow of trade: tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. When a country places limitations on imports from abroad, regardless of whether it uses tariffs, quotas, or nontariff barriers, it is said to be practicing protectionism. Protectionism will raise the price of the protected good in the domestic market, which causes domestic consumers to pay more, but domestic producers to earn more.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nExplain how a tariff reduction causes an increase in the equilibrium quantity of imports and a decrease in the equilibrium price. *Hint:* Consider the [Work It Out](#fs-idm78672016) \"Effects of Trade Barriers.\"\n\n\n\nThis is the opposite case of the Work It Out feature. A reduced tariff is like a decrease in the cost of production, which is shown by a downward (or rightward) shift in the supply curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain how a subsidy on agricultural goods like sugar adversely affects the income of foreign producers of imported sugar.\n\n\n\nA subsidy is like a reduction in cost. This shifts the supply curve down (or to the right), driving the price of sugar down. If the subsidy is large enough, the price of sugar can fall below the cost of production faced by foreign producers, which means they will lose money on any sugar they produce and sell.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWho does protectionism protect? What does it protect them from?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName and define three policy tools for enacting protectionism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does protectionism affect the price of the protected good in the domestic market?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nShow graphically that for any tariff, there is an equivalent quota that would give the same result. What would be the difference, then, between the two types of trade barriers? *Hint*: It is not something you can see from the graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the [Work It Out](#fs-idm78672016) \"Effects of Trade Barriers,\" you can see that a tariff raises the price of imports. What is interesting is that the price rises by less than the amount of the tariff. Who pays the rest of the tariff amount? Can you show this graphically?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nAssume two countries, Thailand (T) and Japan (J), have one good: cameras.

Let\u2019s consider these in turn.\n\n### Fewer Jobs?\n\nIn the early 1990s, the United States was negotiating the **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} with Mexico, an agreement that reduced tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers to trade between the United States, Mexico, and Canada. H. Ross Perot, a 1992 candidate for U.S. president, claimed, in prominent campaign arguments, that if the United States expanded trade with Mexico, there would be a \u201cgiant sucking sound\u201d as U.S. employers relocated to Mexico to take advantage of lower wages. After all, average wages in Mexico were, at that time, about one-eighth of those in the United States. NAFTA passed Congress, President Bill Clinton signed it into law, and it took effect in 1995. For the next six years, the United States economy had some of the most rapid job growth and low unemployment in its history. Those who feared that open trade with Mexico would lead to a dramatic decrease in jobs were proven wrong.\n\nThis result was no surprise to economists. After all, the trend toward globalization has been going on for decades, not just since NAFTA. If trade did reduce the number of available jobs, then the United States should have been seeing a steady loss of jobs for decades. While the United States economy does experience rises and falls in unemployment rates\u2014according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from spring 2008 to late 2009, the unemployment rate rose from 4.4% to 10%; it has since fallen back to 5.5% in spring 2015\u2014the number of jobs is not falling over extended periods of time. The number of U.S. jobs rose from 71 million in 1970 to 138 million in 2012.\n\n**Protectionism**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} certainly saves jobs in the specific industry being protected but, for two reasons, it costs jobs in other unprotected industries. First, if consumers are paying higher prices to the protected industry, they inevitably have less money to spend on goods from other industries, and so jobs are lost in those other industries. Second, if the protected product is sold to other firms, so that other firms must now pay a higher price for a key input, then those firms will lose sales to foreign producers who do not need to pay the higher price. Lost sales translate into lost jobs. The hidden **opportunity cost**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of using protectionism to save jobs in one industry is jobs sacrificed in other industries. This is why the United States International Trade Commission, in its study of barriers to trade, predicts that reducing trade barriers would not lead to an overall loss of jobs. Protectionism reshuffles jobs from industries without import protections to industries that are protected from imports, but it does not create more jobs.\n\nMoreover, the costs of saving jobs through protectionism can be very high. A number of different studies have attempted to estimate the cost to consumers in higher prices per job saved through protectionism. [\\[link\\]](#Table_34_02) shows a sample of results, compiled by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Saving a job through protectionism typically costs much more than the actual worker\u2019s salary. For example, a study published in 2002 compiled evidence that using protectionism to save an average job in the textile and apparel industry would cost $199,000 per job saved. In other words, those workers could have been paid $100,000 per year to be unemployed and the cost would only be half of what it is to keep them working in the textile and apparel industry. This result is not unique to textiles and apparel.\n\n<table id=\"Table_34_02\" summary=\"The table shows the cost to U.S. consumers of saving a job through protectionism.

The basic reason is that not all of the extra money paid by consumers because of tariffs or quotas goes to save jobs. For example, if tariffs are imposed on steel imports so that buyers of steel pay a higher price, U.S. steel companies earn greater profits, buy more equipment, pay bigger bonuses to managers, give pay raises to existing employees\u2014and also avoid firing some additional workers. Only part of the higher price of protected steel goes toward saving jobs. Also, when an industry is protected, the economy as a whole loses the benefits of playing to its comparative advantage\u2014in other words, producing what it is best at. So, part of the higher price that consumers pay for protected goods is lost economic efficiency, which can be measured as another deadweight loss, like that discussed in [Labor and Financial Markets](/m48636){: .target-chapter}.\n\nThere\u2019s a bumper sticker that speaks to the threat some U.S. workers feel from imported products: \u201cBuy American\u2014Save U.S. Jobs.\u201d If the car were being driven by an economist, the sticker might declare: \u201cBlock Imports\u2014Save Jobs for Some Americans, Lose Jobs for Other Americans, and Also Pay High Prices.\u201d\n\n### Trade and Wages\n\nEven if trade does not reduce the number of jobs, it could affect wages. Here, it is important to separate issues about the average level of wages from issues about whether the wages of certain workers may be helped or hurt by trade.\n\nBecause trade raises the amount that an economy can produce by letting firms and workers play to their comparative advantage, trade will also cause the average level of wages in an economy to rise. Workers who can produce more will be more desirable to employers, which will shift the demand for their labor out to the right, and increase wages in the labor market. By contrast, barriers to trade will reduce the average level of wages in an economy.\n\nHowever, even if trade increases the overall wage level, it will still benefit some workers and hurt others. Workers in industries that are confronted by competition from imported products may find that demand for their labor decreases and shifts back to the left, so that their wages decline with a rise in international trade. Conversely, workers in industries that benefit from selling in global markets may find that demand for their labor shifts out to the right, so that trade raises their wages.\n\n\nView this [website][1] to read an article on the issues surrounding fair trade coffee.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\nOne concern is that while **globalization**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} may be benefiting high-skilled, high-wage workers in the United States, it may also impose costs on low-skilled, low-wage workers. After all, high-skilled U.S. workers presumably benefit from increased sales of sophisticated products like computers, machinery, and pharmaceuticals in which the United States has a **comparative advantage**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Meanwhile, low-skilled U.S. workers must now compete against extremely low-wage workers worldwide for making simpler products like toys and clothing. As a result, the wages of low-skilled U.S. workers are likely to fall. There are, however, a number of reasons to believe that while globalization has helped some U.S. industries and hurt others, it has not focused its negative impact on the wages of low-skilled Americans. First, about half of U.S. trade is intra-industry trade. That means the U.S. trades similar goods with other high-wage economies like Canada, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. For instance, in 2014 the U.S. exported over 2 million cars, from all the major automakers, and also imported several million cars from other countries.\n\nMost U.S. workers in these industries have above-average skills and wages\u2014and many of them do quite well in the world of globalization. Some evidence suggested that intra-industry trade between similar countries had a small impact on domestic workers but later evidence indicates that it all depends on how flexible the labor market is. In other words, the key is how flexible workers are in finding jobs in different industries. Trade on low-wage workers depends a lot on the structure of labor markets and indirect effects felt in other parts of the economy. For example, in the United States and the United Kingdom, because labor market frictions are low, the impact of trade on low income workers is small.\n\nSecond, many low-skilled U.S. workers hold service jobs that cannot be replaced by imports from low-wage countries. For example, lawn care services or moving and hauling services or hotel maids cannot be imported from countries long distances away like China or Bangladesh. Competition from imported products is not the primary determinant of their wages.\n\nFinally, while the focus of the discussion here is on wages, it is worth pointing out that low-wage U.S. workers suffer due to protectionism in all the industries\u2014even those that they do not work in the U.S. For example, food and clothing are protected industries. These low-wage workers therefore pay higher prices for these basic necessities and as such their dollar stretches over fewer goods.\n\nThe benefits and costs of increased trade in terms of its effect on wages are not distributed evenly across the economy. However, the growth of international trade has helped to raise the productivity of U.S. workers as a whole\u2014and thus helped to raise the average level of wages.\n\n### Labor Standards and Working Conditions\n\nWorkers in many low-income countries around the world labor under conditions that would be illegal for a worker in the United States. Workers in countries like China, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and Poland are often paid less than the United States **minimum wage**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. For example, in the United States, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour; a typical wage in many low-income countries might be more like $7.25 per day, or often much less. Moreover, working conditions in low-income countries may be extremely unpleasant, or even unsafe. In the worst cases, production may involve the labor of small children or even workers who are treated nearly like slaves. These concerns over standards of foreign labor do not affect most of U.S. trade, which is intra-industry and carried out with other high-income countries that have labor standards similar to the United States, but it is, nonetheless, morally and economically important.\n\nIn thinking about labor standards in other countries, it is important to draw some distinctions between what is truly unacceptable and what is painful to think about. Most people, economists included, have little difficulty with the idea that production by six-year-olds confined in factories or by slave labor is morally unacceptable. They would support aggressive efforts to eliminate such practices\u2014including shutting out imported products made with such labor. Many cases, however, are less clear-cut. An opinion article in the *New York Times* several years ago described the case of Ahmed Zia, a 14-year-old boy from Pakistan. He earned $2 per day working in a carpet factory. He dropped out of school in second grade. Should the United States and other countries refuse to purchase rugs made by Ahmed and his co-workers? If the carpet factories were to close, the likely alternative job for Ahmed is farm work, and as Ahmed says of his carpet-weaving job: \u201cThis makes much more money and is more comfortable.\u201d\n\nOther workers may have even less attractive alternative jobs, perhaps scavenging garbage or prostitution. The real problem for Ahmed and many others in low-income countries is not that globalization has made their lives worse, but rather that they have so few good life alternatives. The United States went through similar situations during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nIn closing, there is some irony when the United States government or U.S. citizens take issue with labor standards in low-income countries, because the United States is not a world leader in government laws to protect employees. In Western European countries and Canada, all citizens are guaranteed some form of national healthcare by the government; the United States does not offer such a guarantee but has moved in the direction of universal health insurance coverage under the recent Affordable Care Act. Many European workers receive six weeks or more of paid vacation per year; in the United States, vacations are often one to three weeks per year. If European countries accused the United States of using unfair labor standards to make U.S. products cheaply, and announced that they would shut out all U.S. imports until the United States adopted guaranteed national healthcare, added more national holidays, and doubled vacation time, Americans would be outraged. Yet when U.S. protectionists start talking about restricting imports from poor countries because of low wage levels and poor working conditions, they are making a very similar argument. This is not to say that labor conditions in low-income countries are not an important issue. They are. However, linking labor conditions in low-income countries to trade deflects the emphasis from the real question to ask: \u201cWhat are acceptable and enforceable minimum labor standards and protections to have the world over?\u201d\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nAs international trade increases, it contributes to a shift in jobs away from industries where that economy does not have a comparative advantage and toward industries where it does have a comparative advantage. The degree to which trade affects labor markets has a lot to do with the structure of the labor market in that country and the adjustment process in other industries. Global trade should raise the average level of wages by increasing productivity. However, this increase in average wages may include both gains to workers in certain jobs and industries and losses to others.\n\nIn thinking about labor practices in low-income countries, it is useful to draw a line between what is unpleasant to think about and what is morally objectionable. For example, low wages and long working hours in poor countries are unpleasant to think about, but for people in low-income parts of the world, it may well be the best option open to them. Practices like child labor and forced labor are morally objectionable and many countries refuse to import products made using these practices.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nExplain how trade barriers save jobs in protected industries, but only by costing jobs in other industries.\n\n\n\nTrade barriers raise the price of goods in protected industries. If those products are inputs in other industries, it raises their production costs and then prices, so sales fall in those other industries. Lower sales lead to lower employment. Additionally, if the protected industries are consumer goods, their customers pay higher prices, which reduce demand for other consumer products and thus employment in those industries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain how trade barriers raise wages in protected industries by reducing average wages economy-wide.\n\n\n\nTrade based on comparative advantage raises the average wage rate economy-wide, though it can reduce the incomes of import-substituting industries. By moving away from a country\u2019s comparative advantage, trade barriers do the opposite: they give workers in protected industries an advantage, while reducing the average wage economy-wide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does international trade affect working conditions of low-income countries?\n\n\n\nBy raising incomes, trade tends to raise working conditions also, even though those conditions may not (yet) be equivalent to those in high-income countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo the jobs for workers in low-income countries that involve making products for export to high-income countries typically pay these workers more or less than their next-best alternative?\n\n\n\nThey typically pay more than the next-best alternative. If a Nike firm did not pay workers at least as much as they would earn, for example, in a subsistence rural lifestyle, they many never come to work for Nike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do trade barriers affect the average income level in an economy?\n\n\n\nSince trade barriers raise prices, real incomes fall. The average worker would also earn less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the cost of \u201csaving\u201d jobs in protected industries compare to the workers\u2019 wages and salaries?\n\n\n\nWorkers working in other sectors and the protected sector see a decrease in their real wage.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nDoes international trade, taken as a whole, increase the total number of jobs, decrease the total number of jobs, or leave the total number of jobs about the same?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs international trade likely to have roughly the same effect on the number of jobs in each individual industry?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is international trade, taken as a whole, likely to affect the average level of wages?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs international trade likely to have about the same effect on everyone\u2019s wages?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nIf trade barriers hurt the average worker in an economy (due to lower wages), why does government create trade barriers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do you think labor standards and working conditions are lower in the low-income countries of the world than in countries like the United States?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cData Retrieval: Employment, Hours, and Earnings (CES).\u201d Last modified February 1, 2013. http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cesbtab1.htm.\n\nDhillon, Kiran. 2015. \u201cWhy Are U.S. Oil Imports Falling?\u201d Time.com.

Countries that institute protectionist policies lose the economic gains achieved through a combination of comparative advantage, specialized learning, and economies of scale. With these overall costs in mind, let us now consider, one by one, a number of arguments that support restricting imports.\n\n### The Infant Industry Argument\n\nImagine Bhutan wants to start its own computer industry, but it has no computer firms that can produce at a low enough price and high enough quality to compete in world markets. However, Bhutanese politicians, business leaders, and workers hope that if the local industry had a chance to get established, before it needed to face international competition, then a domestic company or group of companies could develop the skills, management, technology, and economies of scale that it needs to become a successful profit-earning domestic industry. Thus, the **infant industry argument**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} for protectionism is to block imports for a limited time, to give the infant industry time to mature, before it starts competing on equal terms in the global economy. (Revisit [Macroeconomic Policy Around the World](/m48811){: .target-chapter} for more information on the infant industry argument.)\n\nThe infant industry argument is theoretically possible, even sensible: give an industry a short-term indirect subsidy through protection, and then reap the long-term economic benefits of having a vibrant, healthy industry. Implementation, however, is tricky. In many countries, infant industries have gone from babyhood to senility and obsolescence without ever having reached the profitable maturity stage. Meanwhile, the protectionism that was supposed to be short-term often took a very long time to be repealed.\n\nAs one example, Brazil treated its computer industry as an infant industry from the late 1970s until about 1990. In an attempt to establish its computer industry in the global economy, Brazil largely barred imports of computer products for several decades. This policy guaranteed increased sales for Brazilian computers. However, by the mid-1980s, due to lack of international competition, Brazil had a backward and out-of-date industry, typically lagging behind world standards for price and performance by three to five years\u2014a long time in this fast-moving industry. After more than a decade, during which Brazilian consumers and industries that would have benefited from up-to-date computers paid the costs and Brazil\u2019s computer industry never competed effectively on world markets, Brazil phased out its infant industry policy for the computer industry.\n\nProtectionism for infant industries always imposes costs on domestic users of the product, and typically has provided little benefit in the form of stronger, competitive industries. However, several countries in East Asia offer an exception. Japan, Korea, Thailand, and other countries in this region have sometimes provided a package of indirect and direct subsidies targeted at certain industries, including protection from foreign competition and government loans at interest rates below the market equilibrium. In Japan and Korea, for example, subsidies helped get their domestic steel and auto industries up and running.\n\nWhy did the infant industry policy of protectionism and other subsidies work fairly well in East Asia? A study by the World Bank in the early 1990s offered three guidelines to countries thinking about infant industry protection:\n\n1.  Do not hand out protectionism and other subsidies to all industries, but focus on a few industries where your country has a realistic chance to be a world-class producer.\n2.  Be very hesitant about using protectionism in areas like computers, where many other industries rely on having the best products available, because it is not useful to help one industry by imposing high costs on many other industries.\n3.  Have clear guidelines for when the infant industry policy will end.\n{: type=\"1\"}\n\nIn Korea in the 1970s and 1980s, a common practice was to link protectionism and subsidies to export sales in global markets. If export sales rose, then the infant industry had succeeded and the protectionism could be phased out. If export sales did not rise, then the infant industry policy had failed and the protectionism could be phased out. Either way, the protectionism would be temporary.\n\nFollowing these rules is easier said than done. Politics often intrudes, both in choosing which industries will receive the benefits of being treated as \u201cinfants\u201d and when to phase out import restrictions and other subsidies. Also, if the government of a country wishes to impose costs on its citizens so that it can provide subsidies to a few key industries, it has many tools for doing so: direct government payments, loans, targeted tax reductions, government support of research and development of new technologies, and so on. In other words, protectionism is not the only or even the best way to support key industries.\n\n\nVisit this [website][1] to view a presentation by Pankaj Ghemawat questioning how integrated the world really is.\n\n<span data-type=\"media\" data-alt=\"QR Code representing a URL\">  </span>\n\n\n### The Anti-Dumping Argument\n\n**Dumping**{: data-type=\"term\"} refers to selling goods below their cost of production. **Anti-dumping laws**{: data-type=\"term\"} block imports that are sold below the cost of production by imposing tariffs that increase the price of these imports to reflect their cost of production. Since dumping is not allowed under the rules of the **World Trade Organization (WTO)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, nations that believe they are on the receiving end of dumped goods can file a complaint with the WTO. Anti-dumping complaints have risen in recent years, from about 100 cases per year in the late 1980s to about 200 new cases each year by the late 2000s. Note that dumping cases are countercyclical. During recessions, case filings increase. During economic booms, case filings go down. Individual countries have also frequently started their own anti-dumping investigations. The U.S. government has dozens of anti-dumping orders in place from past investigations. In 2009, for example, some U.S. imports that were under anti-dumping orders included pasta from Turkey, steel pipe fittings from Thailand, pressure-sensitive plastic tape from Italy, preserved mushrooms and lined paper products from India, and cut-to-length carbon steel and non-frozen apple juice concentrate from China.\n\n**Why Might Dumping Occur?**\n\nWhy would foreign firms export a product at less than its cost of production\u2014which presumably means taking a loss? This question has two possible answers, one innocent and one more sinister.\n\nThe innocent explanation is that market prices are set by demand and supply, not by the cost of production. Perhaps demand for a product shifts back to the left or supply shifts out to the right, which drives the market price to low levels\u2014even below the cost of production. When a local store has a going-out-of-business sale, for example, it may sell goods at below the cost of production. If international companies find that there is excess supply of steel or computer chips or machine tools that is driving the market price down below their cost of production\u2014this may be the market in action.\n\nThe sinister explanation is that dumping is part of a long-term strategy. Foreign firms sell goods at prices below the cost of production for a short period of time, and when they have driven out the domestic U.S. competition, they then raise prices. This scenario is sometimes called predatory pricing, which is discussed in the [Monopoly](/m48650){: .target-chapter} chapter.\n\n**Should Anti-Dumping Cases Be Limited?**\n\nAnti-dumping cases pose two questions. How much sense do they make in economic theory? How much sense do they make as practical policy?\n\nIn terms of economic theory, the case for anti-dumping laws is weak. In a market governed by demand and supply, the government does not guarantee that firms will be able to make a profit. After all, low prices are difficult for producers, but benefit consumers. Moreover, although there are plenty of cases in which foreign producers have driven out domestic firms, there are zero documented cases in which the foreign producers then jacked up prices. Instead, foreign producers typically continue competing hard against each other and providing low prices to consumers. In short, it is difficult to find evidence of predatory pricing by foreign firms exporting to the United States.\n\nEven if one could make a case that the government should sometimes enact anti-dumping rules in the short term, and then allow free trade to resume shortly thereafter, there is a growing concern that anti-dumping investigations often involve more politics than careful analysis. The U.S. Commerce Department is charged with calculating the appropriate \u201ccost of production,\u201d which can be as much an art as a science.\n\nFor example, if a company built a new factory two years ago, should part of the factory\u2019s cost be counted in this year\u2019s cost of production? When a company is in a country where prices are controlled by the government, like China for example, how can one measure the true cost of production? When a domestic industry complains loudly enough, government regulators seem very likely to find that unfair dumping has occurred. Indeed, a common pattern has arisen where a domestic industry files an anti-dumping complaint, the governments meet and negotiate a reduction in imports, and then the domestic producers drop the anti-dumping suit. In such cases, anti-dumping cases often appear to be little more than a cover story for imposing tariffs or import quotas.\n\nIn the 1980s, almost all of the anti-dumping cases were initiated by the United States, Canada, the European Union, Australia, and New Zealand. By the 2000s, countries like Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, South Africa, Mexico, and India were filing the majority of the anti-dumping cases before the WTO. As the number of anti-dumping cases has increased, and as countries such as the United States and the European Union feel targeted by the anti-dumping actions of others, the WTO may well propose some additional guidelines to limit the reach of anti-dumping laws.\n\n### The Environmental Protection Argument\n\nThe potential for global trade to affect the environment has become controversial. A president of the Sierra Club, an environmental lobbying organization, once wrote: \u201cThe consequences of globalization for the environment are not good. \u2026 Globalization, if we are lucky, will raise average incomes enough to pay for cleaning up some of the mess that we have made. But before we get there, globalization could also destroy enough of the planet\u2019s basic biological and physical systems that prospects for life itself will be radically compromised.\u201d\n\nIf **free trade**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} meant the destruction of life itself, then even economists would convert to protectionism! While globalization\u2014and economic activity of all kinds\u2014can pose environmental dangers, it seems quite possible that, with the appropriate safeguards in place, the environmental impacts of trade can be minimized. In some cases, trade may even bring environmental benefits.\n\nIn general, **high-income countries**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} such as the United States, Canada, Japan, and the nations of the European Union have relatively strict environmental standards. In contrast, middle- and **low-income countries**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} like Brazil, Nigeria, India, and China have lower environmental standards. The general view of the governments of such countries is that environmental protection is a luxury: as soon as their people have enough to eat, decent healthcare, and longer life expectancies, then they will spend more money on sewage treatment plants, scrubbers to reduce air pollution from factory smokestacks, national parks to protect wildlife, and so on.\n\nThis gap in environmental standards between high-income and low-income countries raises two worrisome possibilities in a world of increasing global trade: the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d scenario and the question of how quickly environmental standards will improve in low-income countries.\n\n**The Race to the Bottom Scenario**\n\nThe **race to the bottom**{: data-type=\"term\"} scenario of global environmental degradation runs like this. Profit-seeking multinational companies shift their production from countries with strong environmental standards to countries with weak standards, thus reducing their costs and increasing their profits. Faced with such behavior, countries reduce their environmental standards to attract multinational firms, which, after all, provide jobs and economic clout. As a result, global production becomes concentrated in countries where it can pollute the most and environmental laws everywhere \u201crace to the bottom.\u201d\n\nAlthough the race-to-the-bottom scenario sounds plausible, it does not appear to describe reality. In fact, the financial incentive for firms to shift production to poor countries to take advantage of their weaker environmental rules does not seem especially powerful. When firms decide where to locate a new factory, they look at many different factors: the costs of labor and financial capital; whether the location is close to a reliable suppliers of the inputs that they need; whether the location is close to customers; the quality of transportation, communications, and electrical power networks; the level of taxes; and the competence and honesty of the local government. The cost of environmental regulations is a factor, too, but typically environmental costs are no more than 1 to 2% of the costs faced by a large industrial plant. The other factors that determine location are much more important to these companies than trying to skimp on environmental protection costs.\n\nWhen an international company does choose to build a plant in a low-income country with lax environmental laws, it typically builds a plant similar to those that it operates in high-income countries with stricter environmental standards. Part of the reason for this decision is that designing an industrial plant is a complex and costly task, and so if a plant works well in a high-income country, companies prefer to use the same design everywhere. Also, companies realize that if they create an environmental disaster in a low-income country, it is likely to cost them a substantial amount of money in paying for damages, lost trust, and reduced sales\u2014by building up-to-date plants everywhere they minimize such risks. As a result of these factors, foreign-owned plants in low-income countries often have a better record of compliance with environmental laws than do locally-owned plants.\n\n**Pressuring Low-Income Countries for Higher Environmental Standards**\n\nIn some cases, the issue is not so much whether globalization will pressure low-income countries to reduce their environmental standards, but instead whether the threat of blocking international trade can pressure these countries into adopting stronger standards. For example, restrictions on ivory imports in high-income countries, along with stronger government efforts to catch elephant poachers, have been credited with helping to reduce the illegal poaching of elephants in certain African countries.\n\nHowever, it would be highly undemocratic for the well-fed citizens of high-income countries to attempt to dictate to the ill-fed citizens of low-income countries what domestic policies and priorities they must adopt, or how they should balance environmental goals against other priorities for their citizens. Furthermore, if high-income countries want stronger environmental standards in low-income countries, they have many options other than the threat of protectionism. For example, high-income countries could pay for anti-pollution equipment in low-income countries, or could help to pay for national parks. High-income countries could help pay for and carry out the scientific and economic studies that would help environmentalists in low-income countries to make a more persuasive case for the economic benefits of protecting the environment.\n\nAfter all, environmental protection is vital to two industries of key importance in many low-income countries\u2014agriculture and tourism. Environmental advocates can set up standards for labeling products, like \u201cthis tuna caught in a net that kept dolphins safe\u201d or \u201cthis product made only with wood not taken from rainforests,\u201d so that consumer pressure can reinforce environmentalist values. These values are also reinforced by the United Nations, which sponsors treaties to address issues such as climate change and global warming, the preservation of biodiversity, the spread of deserts, and the environmental health of the seabed. Countries that share a national border or are within a region often sign environmental agreements about air and water rights, too. The WTO is also becoming more aware of environmental issues and more careful about ensuring that increases in trade do not inflict environmental damage.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that these concerns about the race to the bottom or pressuring low-income countries for more strict environmental standards do not apply very well to the roughly half of all U.S. trade that occurs with other high-income countries. Indeed, many European countries have stricter environmental standards in certain industries than the United States.\n\n### The Unsafe Consumer Products Argument\n\nOne argument for shutting out certain imported products is that they are unsafe for consumers. Indeed, consumer rights groups have sometimes warned that the World Trade Organization would require nations to reduce their health and safety standards for imported products. However, the WTO explains its current agreement on the subject in this way: \u201cIt allows countries to set their own standards.\u201d But it also says \u201cregulations must be based on science. . . . And they should not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate between countries where identical or similar conditions prevail.\u201d Thus, for example, under WTO rules it is perfectly legitimate for the United States to pass laws requiring that *all* food products or cars sold in the United States meet certain safety standards approved by the United States government, whether or not other countries choose to pass similar standards. However, such standards must have some scientific basis. It is improper to impose one set of health and safety standards for domestically produced goods but a different set of standards for imports, or one set of standards for imports from Europe and a different set of standards for imports from Latin America.\n\nIn 2007, Mattel recalled nearly two million toys imported from China due to concerns about high levels of lead in the paint, as well as some loose parts. It is unclear if other toys were subject to similar standards. More recently, in 2013, Japan blocked imports of U.S. wheat because of concerns that genetically modified (GMO) wheat might be included in the shipments. The science on the impact of GMOs on health is still developing.\n\n### The National Interest Argument\n\nSome argue that a nation should not depend too heavily on other countries for supplies of certain key products, such as oil, or for special materials or technologies that might have national security applications. On closer consideration, this argument for protectionism proves rather weak.\n\nAs an example, in the United States, oil provides about 40% of all the energy and 32% of the oil used in the United States economy is imported. Several times in the last few decades, when disruptions in the Middle East have shifted the supply curve of oil back to the left and sharply raised the price, the effects have been felt across the United States economy. This is not, however, a very convincing argument for restricting imports of oil. If the United States needs to be protected from a possible cutoff of foreign oil, then a more reasonable strategy would be to import 100% of the petroleum supply now, and save U.S. domestic oil resources for when or if the foreign supply is cut off. It might also be useful to import extra oil and put it into a stockpile for use in an emergency, as the United States government did by starting a Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1977. Moreover, it may be necessary to discourage people from using oil, and to start a high-powered program to seek out alternatives to oil. A straightforward way to do this would be to raise taxes on oil. What\u2019s more, it makes no sense to argue that because oil is highly important to the United States economy, then the United States should shut out oil imports and use up its domestic supplies of oil more quickly. U.S. domestic production of oil is increasing. Shale oil is adding to domestic supply using fracking extraction techniques.\n\nWhether or not to limit certain kinds of imports of key technologies or materials that might be important to national security and weapons systems is a slightly different issue. If weapons\u2019 builders are not confident that they can continue to obtain a key product in wartime, they might decide to avoid designing weapons that use this key product, or they can go ahead and design the weapons and stockpile enough of the key high-tech components or materials to last through an armed conflict. Indeed, there is a U.S. Defense National Stockpile Center that has built up reserves of many materials, from aluminum oxides, antimony, and bauxite to tungsten, vegetable tannin extracts, and zinc (although many of these stockpiles have been reduced and sold in recent years). Think every country is pro-trade? How about the U.S.? The following Clear it Up might surprise you.\n\n\n\nHow does the United States really feel about expanding trade?\n\nHow do people around the world feel about expanding trade between nations? In summer 2007, the Pew Foundation surveyed 45,000 people in 47 countries. One of the questions asked about opinions on growing trade ties between countries. [\\[link\\]](#Table_34_03) shows the percentages who answered either \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201csomewhat good\u201d for some of countries surveyed.\n\nFor those who think of the United States as the world\u2019s leading supporter of expanding trade, the survey results may be perplexing. When adding up the shares of those who say that growing trade ties between countries is \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201csomewhat good,\u201d Americans had the least favorable attitude toward increasing globalization, while the Chinese and South Africans ranked highest. In fact, among the 47 countries surveyed, the United States ranked by far the lowest on this measure, followed by Egypt, Italy, and Argentina.\n\n<table id=\"Table_34_03\" summary=\"The table shows how people perceive the growing trade ties between countries.

In 1954, the United States became worried that it was importing half of the wool required for military uniforms, so it declared wool and mohair to be \u201cstrategic materials\u201d and began to give subsidies to wool and mohair farmers. Although wool was removed from the official list of \u201cstrategic\u201d materials in 1960, the subsidies for mohair continued for almost 40 years until they were repealed in 1993, and then were reinstated in 2002. All too often, the national interest argument has become an excuse for handing out the indirect subsidy of protectionism to certain industries or companies. After all, decisions about what constitutes a key strategic material are made by politicians, not nonpartisan analysts.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThere are a number of arguments that support restricting imports. These arguments are based around industry and competition, environmental concerns, and issues of safety and security.\n\nThe infant industry argument for protectionism is that small domestic industries need to be temporarily nurtured and protected from foreign competition for a time so that they can grow into strong competitors. In some cases, notably in East Asia, this approach has worked. Often, however, the infant industries never grow up. On the other hand, arguments against dumping (which is setting prices below the cost of production to drive competitors out of the market), often simply seem to be a convenient excuse for imposing protectionism.\n\nLow-income countries typically have lower environmental standards than high-income countries because they are more worried about immediate basics such as food, education, and healthcare. However, except for a small number of extreme cases, shutting off trade seems unlikely to be an effective method of pursuing a cleaner environment.\n\nFinally, there are arguments involving safety and security. Under the rules of the World Trade Organization, countries are allowed to set whatever standards for product safety they wish, but the standards must be the same for domestic products as for imported products and there must be a scientific basis for the standard. The national interest argument for protectionism holds that it is unwise to import certain key products because if the nation becomes dependent on key imported supplies, it could be vulnerable to a cutoff. However, it is often wiser to stockpile resources and to use foreign supplies when available, rather than preemptively restricting foreign supplies so as not to become dependent on them.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nExplain how predatory pricing could be a motivation for dumping.\n\n\n\nIf imports can be sold at extremely low prices, domestic firms would have to match those prices to be competitive. By definition, matching prices would imply selling under cost and, therefore, losing money. Firms cannot sustain losses forever. When they leave the industry, importers can \u201ctake over,\u201d raising prices to monopoly levels to cover their short-term losses and earn long-term profits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do low-income countries like Brazil, Egypt, or Vietnam have lower environmental standards than high-income countries like the Germany, Japan, or the United States?\n\n\n\nBecause low-income countries need to provide necessities\u2014food, clothing, and shelter\u2014to their people. In other words, they consider environmental quality a luxury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain the logic behind the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d argument and the likely reason it has not occurred.\n\n\n\nLow-income countries can compete for jobs by reducing their environmental standards to attract business to their countries. This could lead to a competitive reduction in regulations, which would lead to greater environmental damage. While pollution management is a cost for businesses, it is tiny relative to other costs, like labor and adequate infrastructure. It is also costly for firms to locate far away from their customers, which many low-income countries are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the conditions under which a country may use the unsafe products argument to block imports?\n\n\n\nThe decision should not be arbitrary or unnecessarily discriminatory. It should treat foreign companies the same way as domestic companies. It should be based on science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is the national security argument not convincing?\n\n\n\nRestricting imports today does not solve the problem. If anything, it makes it worse since it implies using up domestic sources of the products faster than if they are imported. Also, the national security argument can be used to support protection of nearly any product, not just things critical to our national security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume a perfectly competitive market and the exporting country is small. Using a demand and supply diagram, show the impact of increasing standards on a low-income exporter of toys. Show the impact of a tariff. Is the effect on the price of toys the same or different? Why is a standards policy preferred to tariffs?\n\n\n\nThe effect of increasing standards may increase costs to the small exporting country. The supply curve of toys will shift to the left. Exports will decrease and toy prices will rise. Tariffs also raise prices. So the effect on the price of toys is the same. A tariff is a \u201csecond best\u201d policy and also affects other sectors. However, a common standard across countries is a \u201cfirst best\u201d policy that attacks the problem at its root.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are main reasons for protecting \u201cinfant industries\u201d? Why is it difficult to stop protecting them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is dumping? Why does prohibiting it often work better in theory than in practice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the \u201crace to the bottom\u201d scenario?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo the rules of international trade require that all nations impose the same consumer safety standards?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the national interest argument for protectionism with regard to certain products?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nHow would direct subsidies to key industries be preferable to tariffs or quotas?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can governments identify good candidates for infant industry protection? Can you suggest some key characteristics of good candidates? Why are industries like computers not good candidates for infant industry protection?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicroeconomic theory argues that it economically rationale (and profitable) to sell additional output as long as the price covers the variable costs of production. How is this relevant to the determination of whether dumping has occurred?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you think Americans would feel if other countries began to urge the United States to increase environmental standards?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it legitimate to impose higher safety standards on imported goods than exist in the foreign country where the goods were produced?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might the unsafe consumer products argument be a more effective strategy (from the perspective of the importing country) than using tariffs or quotas to restrict imports?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might a tax on domestic consumption of resources critical for national security be a more efficient approach than barriers to imports?\n\n\n\n\n### Problems\n\n\n\nYou have just been put in charge of trade policy for Malawi. Coffee is a recent crop that is growing well and the Malawian export market is developing. As such, Malawi coffee is an infant industry. Malawi coffee producers come to you and ask for tariff protection from cheap Tanzanian coffee. What sorts of policies will you enact? Explain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country of Pepperland exports steel to the Land of Submarines.

In the years after the Great Depression and World War II, there was a worldwide push to build institutions that would tie the nations of the world together. The United Nations officially came into existence in 1945. The World Bank, which assists the poorest people in the world, and the International Monetary Fund, which addresses issues raised by international financial transactions, were both created in 1946. The third planned organization was to be an International Trade Organization, which would manage international trade. The United Nations was unable to agree to this. Instead, the **General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)**{: data-type=\"term\"}, was established in 1947 to provide a forum in which nations could come together to negotiate reductions in tariffs and other barriers to trade. In 1995, the GATT was transformed into the WTO.\n\nThe GATT process was to negotiate an agreement to reduce barriers to trade, sign that agreement, pause for a while, and then start negotiating the next agreement. The rounds of talks in the GATT, and now the WTO, are shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_34_06). Notice that the early rounds of GATT talks took a relatively short time, included a small number of countries, and focused almost entirely on reducing tariffs. Since the 1970s, however, rounds of trade talks have taken years, included a large number of countries, and an ever-broadening range of issues.\n\n<table id=\"Table_34_06\" summary=\"The table shows the negotiating rounds of GATT and the WTO. Column 1 lists the year. Column 2 lists the place or name of round. Column 3 lists the main subjects. Column 4 lists the number of countries involved.

The slow pace of international trade talks, however, is understandable, even sensible. Having dozens of nations agree to any treaty is a lengthy process. GATT often set up separate trading rules for certain industries, like agriculture, and separate trading rules for certain countries, like the low-income countries. There were rules, exceptions to rules, opportunities to opt out of rules, and precise wording to be fought over in every case. Like the GATT before it, the WTO is not a world government, with power to impose its decisions on others. The total staff of the WTO in 2014 is 640 people and its annual budget (as of 2014) is $197 million, which makes it smaller in size than many large universities.\n\n### Regional Trading Agreements\n\nThere are different types of economic integration across the globe, ranging from **free trade agreements**{: data-type=\"term\"}, in which participants allow each other\u2019s imports without tariffs or quotas, to **common markets**{: data-type=\"term\"}, in which participants have a common external trade policy as well as free trade within the group, to full **economic unions**{: data-type=\"term\"}, in which, in addition to a common market, monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated. Many nations belong both to the World Trade Organization and to regional trading agreements.\n\nThe best known of these regional trading agreements is the **European Union**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. In the years after World War II, leaders of several European nations reasoned that if they could tie their economies together more closely, they might be more likely to avoid another devastating war. Their efforts began with a free trade association, evolved into a common market, and then transformed into what is now a full economic union, known as the European Union. The EU, as it is often called, has a number of goals. For example, in the early 2000s it introduced a common currency for Europe, the euro, and phased out most of the former national forms of money like the German mark and the French franc, though a few have retained their own currency. Another key element of the union is to eliminate barriers to the mobility of goods, labor, and capital across Europe.\n\nFor the United States, perhaps the best-known regional trading agreement is the **North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. The United States also participates in some less-prominent regional trading agreements, like the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which offers reduced tariffs for imports from these countries, and a free trade agreement with Israel.\n\nThe world has seen a flood of regional trading agreements in recent years. About 100 such agreements are now in place. A few of the more prominent ones are listed in [\\[link\\]](#Table_34_07). Some are just agreements to continue talking; others set specific goals for reducing tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers. One economist described the current trade treaties as a \u201cspaghetti bowl,\u201d which is what a map with lines connecting all the countries with trade treaties looks like.\n\nThere is concern among economists who favor free trade that some of these regional agreements may promise free trade, but actually act as a way for the countries within the regional agreement to try to limit trade from anywhere else. In some cases, the regional trade agreements may even conflict with the broader agreements of the World Trade Organization.\n\n<table id=\"Table_34_07\" summary=\"The tables shows trade agreements (column 1) and the participating countries (column 2).

The United States, for example, imposes import quotas on sugar, because of a fear that such imports would drive down the price of sugar and thus injure domestic sugar producers. One of the jobs of the United States Department of Commerce is to determine if imports from other countries are being dumped. The United States International Trade Commission\u2014a government agency\u2014determines whether domestic industries have been substantially injured by the dumping, and if so, the president can impose tariffs that are intended to offset the unfairly low price.\n\nIn the arena of trade policy, the battle often seems to be between national laws that increase protectionism and international agreements that try to reduce protectionism, like the WTO. Why would a country pass laws or negotiate agreements to shut out certain foreign products, like sugar or textiles, while simultaneously negotiating to reduce trade barriers in general? One plausible answer is that international trade agreements offer a method for countries to restrain their own special interests. A member of Congress can say to an industry lobbying for tariffs or quotas on imports: \u201cSure would like to help you, but that pesky WTO agreement just won\u2019t let me.\u201d\n\n\nIf consumers are the biggest losers from trade, why do they not fight back? The quick answer is because it is easier to organize a small group of people around a narrow interest versus a large group that has diffuse interests. This is a question about trade policy theory.

Countries are almost constantly threatening to challenge the \u201cunfair\u201d trading practices of other nations. Cases are brought to the dispute settlement procedures of the WTO, the European Union, NAFTA, and other regional trading agreements. Politicians in national legislatures, goaded on by lobbyists, often threaten to pass bills that will \u201cestablish a fair playing field\u201d or \u201cprevent unfair trade\u201d\u2014although most such bills seek to accomplish these high-sounding goals by placing more restrictions on trade. Protesters in the streets may object to specific trade rules or to the entire practice of international trade.\n\nThrough all the controversy, the general trend in the last 60 years is clearly toward lower barriers to trade. The average level of tariffs on imported products charged by industrialized countries was 40% in 1946. By 1990, after decades of GATT negotiations, it was down to less than 5%. Indeed, one of the reasons that GATT negotiations shifted from focusing on tariff reduction in the early rounds to a broader agenda was that tariffs had been reduced so dramatically there was not much more to do in that area. U.S. tariffs have followed this general pattern: After rising sharply during the Great Depression, tariffs dropped off to less than 2% by the end of the century. Although measures of import quotas and nontariff barriers are less exact than those for tariffs, they generally appear to be at lower levels, too.\n\nThus, the last half-century has seen both a dramatic reduction in government-created barriers to trade, such as tariffs, import quotas, and nontariff barriers, and also a number of technological developments that have made international trade easier, like advances in transportation, communication, and information management. The result has been the powerful surge of international trade.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nTrade policy is determined at many different levels: administrative agencies within government, laws passed by the legislature, regional negotiations between a small group of nations (sometimes just two), and global negotiations through the World Trade Organization. During the second half of the twentieth century, trade barriers have, in general, declined quite substantially in the United States economy and in the global economy. One reason why countries sign international trade agreements to commit themselves to free trade is to give themselves protection against their own special interests. When an industry lobbies for protection from foreign producers, politicians can point out that, because of the trade treaty, their hands are tied.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a free trade association, a common market, and an economic union?\n\n\n\nA free trade association offers free trade between its members, but each country can determine its own trade policy outside the association. A common market requires a common external trade policy in addition to free trade within the group. An economic union is a common market with coordinated fiscal and monetary policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy would countries promote protectionist laws, while also negotiate for freer trade internationally?\n\n\n\nInternational agreements can serve as a political counterweight to domestic special interests, thereby preventing stronger protectionist measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat might account for the dramatic increase in international trade over the past 50 years?\n\n\n\nReductions in tariffs, quotas, and other trade barriers, improved transportation, and communication media have made people more aware of what is available in the rest of the world.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nName several of the international treaties where countries negotiate with each other over trade policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the general trend of trade barriers over recent decades: higher, lower, or about the same?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf opening up to free trade would benefit a nation, then why do nations not just eliminate their trade barriers, and not bother with international trade negotiations?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhy do you think that the GATT rounds and, more recently, WTO negotiations have become longer and more difficult to resolve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn economic union requires giving up some political autonomy to succeed. What are some examples of political power countries must give up to be members of an economic union?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nUnited States Department of Labor.

{"module_id": "m48830", "module_title": "Economics - m48830", "book_title": "Economics", "section": "m48830", "text": "By the end of this section, you will be able to:\n\n* Asses the complexity of international trade\n* Discuss why a market-oriented economy is so affected by international trade\n* Explain disruptive market change\n\n\n\nEconomists readily acknowledge that international trade is not all sunshine, roses, and happy endings. Over time, the average person gains from international trade, both as a worker who has greater productivity and higher wages because of the benefits of specialization and comparative advantage, and as a consumer who can benefit from shopping all over the world for a greater variety of quality products at attractive prices. The \u201caverage person,\u201d however, is hypothetical, not real\u2014representing a mix of those who have done very well, those who have done all right, and those who have done poorly. It is a legitimate concern of public policy to focus not just on the average or on the success stories, but also on those have not been so fortunate. Workers in other countries, the environment, and prospects for new industries and materials that might be of key importance to the national economy are also all legitimate issues.\n\nThe common belief among economists is that it is better to embrace the gains from trade, and then deal with the costs and tradeoffs with other policy tools, than it is to cut off trade to avoid the costs and tradeoffs.\n\nTo gain a better intuitive understanding for this argument, consider a hypothetical American company called Technotron. Technotron invents a new scientific technology that allows the firm to increase the output and quality of its goods with a smaller number of workers at a lower cost. As a result of this technology, other U.S. firms in this industry will lose money and will also have to lay off workers\u2014and some of the competing firms will even go bankrupt. Should the United States government protect the existing firms and their employees by making it illegal for Technotron to use its new technology? Most people who live in market-oriented economies would oppose trying to block better products that lower the cost of services. Certainly, there is a case for society providing temporary support and assistance for those who find themselves without work. Many would argue for government support of programs that encourage retraining and acquiring additional skills. Government might also support research and development efforts, so that other firms may find ways of outdoing Technotron. Blocking the new technology altogether, however, seems like a mistake. After all, few people would advocate giving up electricity because it caused so much disruption to the kerosene and candle business. Few would suggest holding back on improvements in medical technology because they might cause companies selling leeches and snake oil to lose money. In short, most people view disruptions due to technological change as a necessary cost that is worth bearing.\n\nNow, imagine that Technotron\u2019s new \u201ctechnology\u201d is as simple as this: the company imports what it sells from another country. In other words, think of foreign trade as a type of innovative technology. The objective situation is now exactly the same as before. Because of Technotron\u2019s new technology\u2014which in this case is importing goods from another county\u2014other firms in this industry will lose money and lay off workers. Just as it would have been inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of new scientific technology by trying to shut it down, it would be inappropriate and ultimately foolish to respond to the disruptions of **international trade**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} by trying to restrict trade.\n\nSome workers and firms will suffer because of international trade. In a living, breathing market-oriented economy, some workers and firms will always be experiencing disruptions, for a wide variety of reasons. Corporate management can be better or worse. Workers for a certain firm can be more productive or less. Tough domestic competitors can create just as much disruption as tough foreign competitors. Sometimes a new product is a hit with consumers; sometimes it is a flop. Sometimes a company is blessed by a run of good luck or stricken with a run of bad luck. For some firms, international trade will offer great opportunities for expanding productivity and jobs; for other firms, trade will impose stress and pain. The disruption caused by international trade is not fundamentally different from all the other disruptions caused by the other workings of a market economy.\n\nIn other words, the economic analysis of free trade does not rely on a belief that foreign trade is not disruptive or does not pose tradeoffs; indeed, the story of Technotron begins with a particular **disruptive market change**{: data-type=\"term\"}\u2014a new technology\u2014that causes real tradeoffs. In thinking about the disruptions of foreign trade, or any of the other possible costs and tradeoffs of foreign trade discussed in this chapter, the best public policy solutions typically do not involve protectionism, but instead involve finding ways for public policy to address the particular issues, while still allowing the benefits of international trade to occur.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s the Downside of Protection?\n\nThe domestic flat-panel display industry employed many workers before the ITC imposed the dumping margin tax. Flat-panel displays make up a significant portion of the cost of producing laptop computers\u2014as much as 50%. Therefore, the antidumping tax would substantially increase the cost, and thus the price, of U.S.-manufactured laptops. As a result of the ITC\u2019s decision, Apple moved its domestic manufacturing plant for Macintosh computers to Ireland (where it had an existing plant). Toshiba shut down its U.S. manufacturing plant for laptops. And IBM cancelled plans to open a laptop manufacturing plant in North Carolina, instead deciding to expand production at its plant in Japan. In this case, rather than having the desired effect of protecting U.S. interests and giving domestic manufacturing an advantage over items manufactured elsewhere, it had the unintended effect of driving the manufacturing completely out of the country. Many people lost their jobs and most flat-panel display production now occurs in countries other than the United States.\n\n\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nInternational trade certainly has income distribution effects. This is hardly surprising. All domestic or international competitive market forces are disruptive. They cause companies and industries to rise and fall. Government has a role to play in cushioning workers against the disruptions of the market. However, just as it would be unwise in the long term to clamp down on new technology and other causes of disruption in domestic markets, it would be unwise to clamp down on foreign trade. In both cases, the disruption brings with it economic benefits.\n\n### Self-Check Questions\n\n\n\nHow does competition, whether domestic or foreign, harm businesses?\n\n\n\nCompetition from firms with better or cheaper products can reduce a business\u2019s profits, and may drive it out of business. Workers would similarly lose income or even their jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the gains from competition?\n\n\n\nConsumers get better or less expensive products. Businesses with the better or cheaper products increase their profits. Employees of those businesses earn more income. On balance, the gains outweigh the losses to a nation.\n\n\n\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWho gains and who loses from trade?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is trade a good thing if some people lose?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are some ways that governments can help people who lose from trade?\n\n\n\n\n### Critical Thinking Questions\n\n\n\nWhat are some examples of innovative products that have disrupted their industries for the better?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn principle, the benefits of international trade to a country exceed the costs, no matter whether the country is importing or exporting. In practice, it is not always possible to compensate the losers in a country, for example, workers who lose their jobs due to foreign imports. In your opinion, does that mean that trade should be inhibited to prevent the losses?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists sometimes say that protectionism is the \u201csecond-best\u201d choice for dealing with any particular problem. What they mean is that there is often a policy choice that is more direct or effective for dealing with the problem\u2014a choice that would still allow the benefits of trade to occur. Explain why protectionism is a \u201csecond-best\u201d choice for:\n\n1.  helping workers as a group\n2.  helping industries stay strong\n3.  protecting the environment\n4.  advancing national defense\n{: type=\"a\"}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade has income distribution effects. For example, suppose that because of a government-negotiated reduction in trade barriers, trade between Germany and the Czech Republic increases. Germany sells house paint to the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic sells alarm clocks to Germany. Would you expect this pattern of trade to increase or decrease jobs and wages in the paint industry in Germany? The alarm clock industry in Germany? The paint industry in Czech Republic? The alarm clock industry in Czech Republic? What has to happen for there to be no increase in total unemployment in both countries?\n\n\n\n\n### References\n\nE.

There is no important concept in this course that cannot be explained without mathematics. That said, math is a tool that can be used to illustrate economic concepts. Remember the saying a picture is worth a thousand words? Instead of a picture, think of a graph. It is the same thing. Economists use models as the primary tool to derive insights about economic issues and problems. Math is one way of working with (or manipulating) economic models.\n\nThere are other ways of representing models, such as text or narrative. But why would you use your fist to bang a nail, if you had a hammer? Math has certain advantages over text. It disciplines your thinking by making you specify exactly what you mean. You can get away with fuzzy thinking in your head, but you cannot when you reduce a model to algebraic equations. At the same time, math also has disadvantages. Mathematical models are necessarily based on simplifying assumptions, so they are not likely to be perfectly realistic. Mathematical models also lack the nuances which can be found in narrative models. The point is that math is one tool, but it is not the only tool or even always the best tool economists can use. So what math will you need for this book? The answer is: little more than high school algebra and graphs. You will need to know:\n\n* What a function is\n* How to interpret the equation of a line (i.e., slope and intercept)\n* How to manipulate a line (i.e., changing the slope or the intercept)\n* How to compute and interpret a growth rate (i.e., percentage change)\n* How to read and manipulate a graph\n\nIn this text, we will use the easiest math possible, and we will introduce it in this appendix. So if you find some math in the book that you cannot follow, come back to this appendix to review. Like most things, math has diminishing returns. A little math ability goes a long way; the more advanced math you bring in, the less additional knowledge that will get you. That said, if you are going to major in economics, you should consider learning a little calculus. It will be worth your while in terms of helping you learn advanced economics more quickly.\n\n### Algebraic Models\n\nOften economic models (or parts of models) are expressed in terms of mathematical functions. What is a function? A **function**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} describes a relationship. Sometimes the relationship is a definition. For example (using words), your professor is Adam Smith. This could be expressed as Professor = Adam Smith. Or Friends = Bob + Shawn + Margaret.\n\nOften in economics, functions describe cause and effect. The variable on the left-hand side is what is being explained (\u201cthe effect\u201d). On the right-hand side is what is doing the explaining (\u201cthe causes\u201d). For example, suppose your GPA was determined as follows:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>GPA\u00a0=\u00a00.25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0combined\\_SAT\u00a0+\u00a00.25\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0class\\_attendance\u00a0+\u00a00.50\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0hours\\_spent\\_studying</mtext></math>\n\n\nThis equation states that your GPA depends on three things: your combined SAT score, your class attendance, and the number of hours you spend studying. It also says that study time is twice as important (0.50) as either combined\\\\\\_SAT score (0.25) or class\\\\\\_attendance (0.25). If this relationship is true, how could you raise your GPA? By not skipping class and studying more. Note that you cannot do anything about your SAT score, since if you are in college, you have (presumably) already taken the SATs.\n\nOf course, economic models express relationships using economic variables, like Budget = money\\\\\\_spent\\\\\\_on\\\\\\_econ\\\\\\_books + money\\\\\\_spent\\\\\\_on\\\\\\_music, assuming that the only things you buy are economics books and music.\n\nMost of the relationships we use in this course are expressed as linear equations of the form:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>y\u00a0=\u00a0b\u00a0+\u00a0mx</mtext></math>\n\n\n**Expressing Equations Graphically**\n\nGraphs are useful for two purposes. The first is to express equations visually, and the second is to display statistics or data. This section will discuss expressing equations visually.\n\nTo a mathematician or an economist, a **variable**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of values. In the equation of a line presented above, x and y are the variables, with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis, and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line. To see how this equation works, consider a numerical example:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>y\u00a0=\u00a09\u00a0+\u00a03x</mtext></math>\n\n\nIn this equation for a specific line, the b term has been set equal to 9 and the m term has been set equal to 3. [\\[link\\]](#Table_A_01) shows the values of x and y for this given equation. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_010) shows this equation, and these values, in a graph. To construct the table, just plug in a series of different values for x, and then calculate what value of y results. In the figure, these points are plotted and a line is drawn through them.\n\n<table id=\"Table_A_01\" summary=\"The table shows the values for the slop intercept equation. Column 1 shows the values for x. Column 2 shows the values for y. Row 1: (0, 9); Row 2: (1, 12); Row 3: (2, 15); Row 4: (3, 18); Row 5: (4, 21); Row 6: (5, 24); Row 7: (6, 27).\"><caption><span data-type=\"title\">Values for the Slope Intercept Equation</span></caption><thead>\n<tr>\n<th>x</th>\n<th>y</th>\n</tr>\n</thead><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>9</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>12</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>18</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>24</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>27</td>\n</tr>\n\n      </tbody></table>\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_A01_010 data-title=\"Slope and the Algebra of Straight Lines \"}\n\nThis example illustrates how the b and m terms in an equation for a straight line determine the shape of the line. The b term is called the y-intercept. The reason for this name is that, if x = 0, then the b term will reveal where the line intercepts, or crosses, the y-axis. In this example, the line hits the vertical axis at 9. The m term in the equation for the line is the slope. Remember that **slope**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is defined as rise over run; more specifically, the slope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis. In this example, each time the x term increases by one (the run), the y term rises by three. Thus, the slope of this line is three. Specifying a y-intercept and a slope\u2014that is, specifying b and m in the equation for a line\u2014will identify a specific line. Although it is rare for real-world data points to arrange themselves as an exact straight line, it often turns out that a straight line can offer a reasonable approximation of actual data.\n\n**Interpreting the Slope**\n\nThe concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables. A **positive slope**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} means that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x decreases, y decreases also. Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line rises. The length-weight relationship, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_008) later in this Appendix, has a positive slope. We will learn in other chapters that price and quantity supplied have a positive relationship; that is, firms will supply more when the price is higher.\n\nA **negative slope**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} means that two variables are negatively related; that is, when x increases, y decreases, or when x decreases, y increases. Graphically, a negative slope means that, as the line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line falls. The altitude-air density relationship, shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_009) later in this appendix, has a negative slope. We will learn that price and quantity demanded have a negative relationship; that is, consumers will purchase less when the price is higher.\n\nA slope of zero means that there is no relationship between x and y. Graphically, the line is flat; that is, zero rise over the run. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_025) of the unemployment rate, shown later in this appendix, illustrates a common pattern of many line graphs: some segments where the slope is positive, other segments where the slope is negative, and still other segments where the slope is close to zero.\n\nThe slope of a straight line between two points can be calculated in numerical terms. To calculate slope, begin by designating one point as the \u201cstarting point\u201d and the other point as the \u201cend point\u201d and then calculating the rise over run between these two points. As an example, consider the slope of the air density graph between the points representing an altitude of 4,000 meters and an altitude of 6,000 meters:\n\nRise: Change in variable on vertical axis (end point minus original point)\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>0.100\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.307</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u20130.207</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nRun: Change in variable on horizontal axis (end point minus original point)\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px 2px 2px\" columnalign=\"center center left\"><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>6,000\u00a0\u2013\u00a04,000</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>2,000</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nThus, the slope of a straight line between these two points would be that from the altitude of 4,000 meters up to 6,000 meters, the density of the air decreases by approximately 0.1 kilograms/cubic meter for each of the next 1,000 meters\n\nSuppose the slope of a line were to increase. Graphically, that means it would get steeper. Suppose the slope of a line were to decrease. Then it would get flatter. These conditions are true whether or not the slope was positive or negative to begin with. A higher positive slope means a steeper upward tilt to the line, while a smaller positive slope means a flatter upward tilt to the line. A negative slope that is larger in absolute value (that is, more negative) means a steeper downward tilt to the line. A slope of zero is a horizontal flat line. A vertical line has an infinite slope.\n\nSuppose a line has a larger intercept. Graphically, that means it would shift out (or up) from the old origin, parallel to the old line. If a line has a smaller intercept, it would shift in (or down), parallel to the old line.\n\n**Solving Models with Algebra**\n\nEconomists often use models to answer a specific question, like: What will the unemployment rate be if the economy grows at 3% per year? Answering specific questions requires solving the \u201csystem\u201d of equations that represent the model.\n\nSuppose the demand for personal pizzas is given by the following equation:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Qd\u00a0=\u00a016\u00a0\u2013\u00a02P</mtext></math>\n\n\nwhere Qd is the amount of personal pizzas consumers want to buy (i.e., quantity demanded), and P is the price of pizzas. Suppose the supply of personal pizzas is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Qs\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0+\u00a05P</mtext></math>\n\n\nwhere Qs is the amount of pizza producers will supply (i.e., quantity supplied).\n\nFinally, suppose that the personal pizza market operates where supply equals demand, or\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Qd\u00a0=\u00a0Qs</mtext></math>\n\n\nWe now have a system of three equations and three unknowns (Qd, Qs, and P), which we can solve with algebra:\n\nSince Qd = Qs, we can set the demand and supply equation equal to each other:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Qd</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>Qs</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>16\u00a0\u2013\u00a02P</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>2\u00a0+\u00a05P</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nSubtracting 2 from both sides and adding 2P to both sides yields:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>16\u00a0\u2013\u00a02P\u00a0\u2013\u00a02</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>2\u00a0+\u00a05P\u00a0\u2013\u00a02</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>14\u00a0\u2013\u00a02P</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>5P</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>14\u00a0\u2013\u00a02P\u00a0+\u00a02P</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>5P\u00a0+\u00a02P</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>14</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>7P</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mfrac><mtext>14</mtext><mtext>7</mtext></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>7P</mtext><mtext>7</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>2</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>P</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nIn other words, the price of each personal pizza will be $2. How much will consumers buy?\n\nTaking the price of $2, and plugging it into the demand equation, we get:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Qd</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>16\u00a0\u2013\u00a02P</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>16\u00a0\u2013\u00a02(2)</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>16\u00a0\u2013\u00a04</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>12</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nSo if the price is $2 each, consumers will purchase 12.

This means we did our math correctly, since Qd = Qs.\n\n**Solving Models with Graphs**\n\nIf algebra is not your forte, you can get the same answer by using graphs. Take the equations for Qd and Qs and graph them on the same set of axes as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_024). Since P is on the vertical axis, it is easiest if you solve each equation for P. The demand curve is then P = 8 \u2013 0.5Qd and the demand curve is P = \u20130.4 + 0.2Qs. Note that the vertical intercepts are 8 and \u20130.4, and the slopes are \u20130.5 for demand and 0.2 for supply. If you draw the graphs carefully, you will see that where they cross (Qs = Qd), the price is $2 and the quantity is 12, just like the algebra predicted.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_A01_024 data-title=\"Supply and Demand Graph \"}\n\nWe will use graphs more frequently in this book than algebra, but now you know the math behind the graphs.\n\n### Growth Rates\n\nGrowth rates are frequently encountered in real world economics. A **growth rate**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is simply the percentage change in some quantity. It could be your income. It could be a business\u2019s sales. It could be a nation\u2019s GDP. The formula for computing a growth rate is straightforward:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Percentage\u00a0change</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>Change\u00a0in\u00a0quantity</mtext><mtext>Quantity</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nSuppose your job pays $10 per hour. Your boss, however, is so impressed with your work that he gives you a $2 per hour raise. The percentage change (or growth rate) in your pay is $2/$10 = 0.20 or 20%.\n\nTo compute the growth rate for data over an extended period of time, for example, the average annual growth in GDP over a decade or more, the denominator is commonly defined a little differently. In the previous example, we defined the quantity as the initial quantity\u2014or the quantity when we started. This is fine for a one-time calculation, but when we compute the growth over and over, it makes more sense to define the quantity as the average quantity over the period in question, which is defined as the quantity halfway between the initial quantity and the next quantity. This is harder to explain in words than to show with an example. Suppose a nation\u2019s GDP was $1 trillion in 2005 and $1.03 trillion in 2006. The growth rate between 2005 and 2006 would be the change in GDP ($1.03 trillion \u2013 $1.00 trillion) divided by the average GDP between 2005 and 2006 ($1.03 trillion + $1.00 trillion)/2. In other words:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>$1.03\u00a0trillion\u00a0\u2013\u00a0$1.00\u00a0trillion</mtext><mtext>($1.03\u00a0trillion\u00a0+\u00a0$1.00\u00a0trillion)\u00a0/\u00a02</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>0.03</mtext><mtext>1.015</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>0.0296</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>2.96%\u00a0growth</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nNote that if we used the first method, the calculation would be ($1.03 trillion \u2013 $1.00 trillion) / $1.00 trillion = 3% growth, which is approximately the same as the second, more complicated method. If you need a rough approximation, use the first method. If you need accuracy, use the second method.\n\nA few things to remember: A positive growth rate means the quantity is growing. A smaller growth rate means the quantity is growing more slowly. A larger growth rate means the quantity is growing more quickly. A negative growth rate means the quantity is decreasing.\n\nThe same change over times yields a smaller growth rate. If you got a $2 raise each year, in the first year the growth rate would be $2/$10 = 20%, as shown above. But in the second year, the growth rate would be $2/$12 = 0.167 or 16.7% growth. In the third year, the same $2 raise would correspond to a $2/$14 = 14.2%. The moral of the story is this: To keep the growth rate the same, the change must increase each period.\n\n### Displaying Data Graphically and Interpreting the Graph\n\nGraphs are also used to display data or evidence. Graphs are a method of presenting numerical patterns. They condense detailed numerical information into a visual form in which relationships and numerical patterns can be seen more easily. For example, which countries have larger or smaller populations? A careful reader could examine a long list of numbers representing the populations of many countries, but with over 200 nations in the world, searching through such a list would take concentration and time. Putting these same numbers on a graph can quickly reveal population patterns. Economists use graphs both for a compact and readable presentation of groups of numbers and for building an intuitive grasp of relationships and connections.\n\nThree types of graphs are used in this book: line graphs, pie graphs, and bar graphs. Each is discussed below. We also provide warnings about how graphs can be manipulated to alter viewers\u2019 perceptions of the relationships in the data.\n\n**Line Graphs**\n\nThe graphs we have discussed so far are called **line graphs**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, because they show a relationship between two variables: one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis.\n\nSometimes it is useful to show more than one set of data on the same axes. The data in [\\[link\\]](#Table_A_02) is displayed in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_008) which shows the relationship between two variables: length and median weight for American baby boys and girls during the first three years of life. (The **median**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half weigh less.) The line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds on the vertical axis. For example, point A on the figure shows that a boy who is 28 inches long will have a median weight of about 19 pounds. One line on the graph shows the length-weight relationship for boys and the other line shows the relationship for girls. This kind of graph is widely used by healthcare providers to check whether a child\u2019s physical development is roughly on track.\n\n is typically 19 pounds in weight (measured on the vertical axis). These data apply only to children in the first three years of life.\"){: #CNX_Econ_A01_008 data-title=\"The Length-Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_A_02\" summary=\"The table shows length (inches) and weight (pounds) for Boys from birth to 36 months and Girls from birth to 36 months.

Sometimes they are curves. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_009) presents another example of a line graph, representing the data from [\\[link\\]](#Table_A_03). In this case, the line graph shows how thin the air becomes when you climb a mountain. The horizontal axis of the figure shows altitude, measured in meters above sea level. The vertical axis measures the density of the air at each altitude. Air density is measured by the weight of the air in a cubic meter of space (that is, a box measuring one meter in height, width, and depth). As the graph shows, air pressure is heaviest at ground level and becomes lighter as you climb. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_009) shows that a cubic meter of air at an altitude of 500 meters weighs approximately one kilogram (about 2.2 pounds). However, as the altitude increases, air density decreases. A cubic meter of air at the top of Mount Everest, at about 8,828 meters, would weigh only 0.023 kilograms. The thin air at high altitudes explains why many mountain climbers need to use oxygen tanks as they reach the top of a mountain.\n\n and air density of 0.023 kilograms per cubic meter (the vertical axis).\"){: #CNX_Econ_A01_009 data-title=\"Altitude-Air Density Relationship \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_A_03\" summary=\"The table shows the relationship between altitude and air density.

If you were to collect actual data on air pressure at different altitudes, the same altitude in different geographic locations will have slightly different air density, depending on factors like how far you are from the equator, local weather conditions, and the humidity in the air. Similarly, in measuring the height and weight of children for the previous line graph, children of a particular height would have a range of different weights, some above average and some below. In the real world, this sort of variation in data is common. The task of a researcher is to organize that data in a way that helps to understand typical patterns. The study of statistics, especially when combined with computer statistics and spreadsheet programs, is a great help in organizing this kind of data, plotting line graphs, and looking for typical underlying relationships. For most economics and social science majors, a statistics course will be required at some point.\n\nOne common line graph is called a **time series**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis displays another variable. Thus, a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time.

The points for the unemployment rate in each year are plotted on the graph, and a line then connects the points, showing how the unemployment rate has moved up and down since 1975. The line graph makes it easy to see, for example, that the highest unemployment rate during this time period was slightly less than 10% in the early 1980s and 2010, while the unemployment rate declined from the early 1990s to the end of the 1990s, before rising and then falling back in the early 2000s, and then rising sharply during the recession from 2008\u20132009.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_A01_025 data-title=\"U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1975&#x2013;2014\"}\n\n**Pie Graphs**\n\nA **pie graph**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (sometimes called a **pie chart**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}) is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts.

For example, 50% would be half of the pie and 20% would be one-fifth of the pie. The three pie graphs in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_020) show that the share of the U.S. population 65 and over is growing. The pie graphs allow you to get a feel for the relative size of the different age groups from 1970 to 2000 to 2030, without requiring you to slog through the specific numbers and percentages in the table. Some common examples of how pie graphs are used include dividing the population into groups by age, income level, ethnicity, religion, occupation; dividing different firms into categories by size, industry, number of employees; and dividing up government spending or taxes into its main categories.\n\n**Bar Graphs**\n\nA **bar graph**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} uses the height of different bars to compare quantities.

[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_021) (a) shows three bars for each year, representing the total number of persons in each age bracket for each year. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_021) (b) shows just one bar for each year, but the different age groups are now shaded inside the bar. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_021) (c), still based on the same data, the vertical axis measures percentages rather than the number of persons. In this case, all three bar graphs are the same height, representing 100% of the population, with each bar divided according to the percentage of population in each age group. It is sometimes easier for a reader to run his or her eyes across several bar graphs, comparing the shaded areas, rather than trying to compare several pie graphs.\n\n  Shows three bars for each year, representing the total number of persons in each age bracket for each year. (b) Shows just one bar for each year, but the different age groups are now shaded inside the bar. (c) Sets the vertical axis as a measure of percentages rather than the number of persons. All three bar graphs are the same height and each bar is divided according to the percentage of population in each age group.\"){: #CNX_Econ_A01_021 data-title=\"U.S. Population with Bar Graphs \"}\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_004) and [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_021) show how the bars can represent countries or years, and how the vertical axis can represent a numerical or a percentage value. Bar graphs can also compare size, quantity, rates, distances, and other quantitative categories.\n\n**Comparing Line Graphs with Pie Charts and Bar Graphs**\n\nNow that you are familiar with pie graphs, bar graphs, and line graphs, how do you know which graph to use for your data? Pie graphs are often better than line graphs at showing how an overall group is divided. However, if a pie graph has too many slices, it can become difficult to interpret.\n\nBar graphs are especially useful when comparing quantities. For example, if you are studying the populations of different countries, as in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_004), bar graphs can show the relationships between the population sizes of multiple countries. Not only can it show these relationships, but it can also show breakdowns of different groups within the population.\n\nA line graph is often the most effective format for illustrating a relationship between two variables that are both changing. For example, time series graphs can show patterns as time changes, like the unemployment rate over time. Line graphs are widely used in economics to present continuous data about prices, wages, quantities bought and sold, the size of the economy.\n\n**How Graphs Can Be Misleading**\n\nGraphs not only reveal patterns; they can also alter how patterns are perceived. To see some of the ways this can be done, consider the line graphs of [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_022), [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_023), and [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_017). These graphs all illustrate the unemployment rate\u2014but from different perspectives.\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_A01_022}\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_A01_023 data-title=\"Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them Accurate \"}\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_A01_017 data-title=\"Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them Accurate \"}\n\nSuppose you wanted a graph which gives the impression that the rise in unemployment in 2009 was not all that large, or all that extraordinary by historical standards. You might choose to present your data as in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_022) (a). [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_022) (a) includes much of the same data presented earlier in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_025), but stretches the horizontal axis out longer relative to the vertical axis. By spreading the graph wide and flat, the visual appearance is that the rise in unemployment is not so large, and is similar to some past rises in unemployment. Now imagine you wanted to emphasize how unemployment spiked substantially higher in 2009. In this case, using the same data, you can stretch the vertical axis out relative to the horizontal axis, as in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_022) (b), which makes all rises and falls in unemployment appear larger.\n\nA similar effect can be accomplished without changing the length of the axes, but by changing the scale on the vertical axis. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_023) (c), the scale on the vertical axis runs from 0% to 30%, while in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_023) (d), the vertical axis runs from 3% to 10%. Compared to [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_025), where the vertical scale runs from 0% to 12%, [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_023) (c) makes the fluctuation in unemployment look smaller, while [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_023) (d) makes it look larger.\n\nAnother way to alter the perception of the graph is to reduce the amount of variation by changing the number of points plotted on the graph. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_023) (e) shows the unemployment rate according to five-year averages. By averaging out some of the year- to-year changes, the line appears smoother and with fewer highs and lows. In reality, the unemployment rate is reported monthly, and [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_017) (f) shows the monthly figures since 1960, which fluctuate more than the five-year average. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_017) (f) is also a vivid illustration of how graphs can compress lots of data. The graph includes monthly data since 1960, which over almost 50 years, works out to nearly 600 data points. Reading that list of 600 data points in numerical form would be hypnotic. You can, however, get a good intuitive sense of these 600 data points very quickly from the graph.\n\nA final trick in manipulating the perception of graphical information is that, by choosing the starting and ending points carefully, you can influence the perception of whether the variable is rising or falling. The original data show a general pattern with unemployment low in the 1960s, but spiking up in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, and late 2000s. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A01_017) (g), however, shows a graph that goes back only to 1975, which gives an impression that unemployment was more-or-less gradually falling over time until the 2009 recession pushed it back up to its \u201coriginal\u201d level\u2014which is a plausible interpretation if one starts at the high point around 1975.\n\nThese kinds of tricks\u2014or shall we just call them \u201cpresentation choices\u201d\u2014 are not limited to line graphs. In a pie chart with many small slices and one large slice, someone must decided what categories should be used to produce these slices in the first place, thus making some slices appear bigger than others. If you are making a bar graph, you can make the vertical axis either taller or shorter, which will tend to make variations in the height of the bars appear more or less.\n\nBeing able to read graphs is an essential skill, both in economics and in life. A graph is just one perspective or point of view, shaped by choices such as those discussed in this section. Do not always believe the first quick impression from a graph. View with caution.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nMath is a tool for understanding economics and economic relationships can be expressed mathematically using algebra or graphs. The algebraic equation for a line is y = b + mx, where x is the variable on the horizontal axis and y is the variable on the vertical axis, the b term is the y-intercept and the m term is the slope. The slope of a line is the same at any point on the line and it indicates the relationship (positive, negative, or zero) between two economic variables.\n\nEconomic models can be solved algebraically or graphically. Graphs allow you to illustrate data visually. They can illustrate patterns, comparisons, trends, and apportionment by condensing the numerical data and providing an intuitive sense of relationships in the data. A line graph shows the relationship between two variables: one is shown on the horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis. A pie graph shows how something is allotted, such as a sum of money or a group of people. The size of each slice of the pie is drawn to represent the corresponding percentage of the whole. A bar graph uses the height of bars to show a relationship, where each bar represents a certain entity, like a country or a group of people. The bars on a bar graph can also be divided into segments to show subgroups.\n\nAny graph is a single visual perspective on a subject. The impression it leaves will be based on many choices, such as what data or time frame is included, how data or groups are divided up, the relative size of vertical and horizontal axes, whether the scale used on a vertical starts at zero. Thus, any graph should be regarded somewhat skeptically, remembering that the underlying relationship can be open to different interpretations.\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nName three kinds of graphs and briefly state when is most appropriate to use each type of graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is slope on a line graph?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do the slices of a pie chart represent?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is a bar chart the best way to illustrate comparisons?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does the appearance of positive slope differ from negative slope and from zero slope?", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

In [Consumer Choices](/m48640){: .target-chapter}, the level of **utility**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} that a person receives is described in numerical terms. This appendix presents an alternative approach to describing personal preferences, called indifference curves, which avoids any need for using numbers to measure utility. By setting aside the assumption of putting a numerical valuation on utility\u2014an assumption that many students and economists find uncomfortably unrealistic\u2014the **indifference curve**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} framework helps to clarify the logic of the underlying model.\n\n### What Is an Indifference Curve?\n\nPeople cannot really put a numerical value on their level of satisfaction. However, they can, and do, identify what choices would give them more, or less, or the same amount of satisfaction. An indifference curve shows combinations of goods that provide an equal level of utility or satisfaction. For example, [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_001) presents three indifference curves that represent Lilly\u2019s preferences for the tradeoffs that she faces in her two main relaxation activities: eating doughnuts and reading paperback books. Each indifference curve (Ul, Um, and Uh) represents one level of utility. First we will explore the meaning of one particular indifference curve and then we will look at the indifference curves as a group.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_A06_001 data-title=\"Lilly&#x2019;s Indifference Curves \"}\n\n**The Shape of an Indifference Curve**\n\nThe indifference curve Um has four points labeled on it: A, B, C, and D. Since an indifference curve represents a set of choices that have the same level of utility, Lilly must receive an equal amount of utility, judged according to her personal preferences, from two books and 120 doughnuts (point A), from three books and 84 doughnuts (point B) from 11 books and 40 doughnuts (point C) or from 12 books and 35 doughnuts (point D). She would also receive the same utility from any of the unlabeled intermediate points along this indifference curve.\n\nIndifference curves have a roughly similar shape in two ways: 1) they are downward sloping from left to right; 2) they are convex with respect to the origin. In other words, they are steeper on the left and flatter on the right. The downward slope of the indifference curve means that Lilly must trade off less of one good to get more of the other, while holding utility constant. For example, points A and B sit on the same indifference curve Um, which means that they provide Lilly with the same level of utility. Thus, the **marginal utility**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} that Lilly would gain from, say, increasing her consumption of books from two to three must be equal to the marginal utility that she would lose if her consumption of doughnuts was cut from 120 to 84\u2014so that her overall utility remains unchanged between points A and B. Indeed, the slope along an indifference curve is referred to as the **marginal rate of substitution**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which is the rate at which a person is willing to trade one good for another so that utility will remain the same.\n\nIndifference curves like Um are steeper on the left and flatter on the right. The reason behind this shape involves diminishing marginal utility\u2014the notion that as a person consumes more of a good, the marginal utility from each additional unit becomes lower. Compare two different choices between points that all provide Lilly an equal amount of utility along the indifference curve Um: the choice between A and B, and between C and D. In both choices, Lilly consumes one more book, but between A and B her consumption of doughnuts falls by 36 (from 120 to 84) and between C and D it falls by only five (from 40 to 35). The reason for this difference is that points A and C are different starting points, and thus have different implications for marginal utility. At point A, Lilly has few books and many doughnuts. Thus, her marginal utility from an extra book will be relatively high while the marginal utility of additional doughnuts is relatively low\u2014so on the margin, it will take a relatively large number of doughnuts to offset the utility from the marginal book. At point C, however, Lilly has many books and few doughnuts. From this starting point, her marginal utility gained from extra books will be relatively low, while the marginal utility lost from additional doughnuts would be relatively high\u2014so on the margin, it will take a relatively smaller number of doughnuts to offset the change of one marginal book. In short, the slope of the indifference curve changes because the marginal rate of substitution\u2014that is, the quantity of one good that would be traded for the other good to keep utility constant\u2014also changes, as a result of **diminishing marginal utility**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} of both goods.\n\n**The Field of Indifference Curves**\n\nEach indifference curve represents the choices that provide a single level of utility. Every level of utility will have its own indifference curve. Thus, Lilly\u2019s preferences will include an infinite number of indifference curves lying nestled together on the diagram\u2014even though only three of the indifference curves, representing three levels of utility, appear on [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_001). In other words, an infinite number of indifference curves are not drawn on this diagram\u2014but you should remember that they exist.\n\nHigher indifference curves represent a greater level of utility than lower ones. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_001), indifference curve Ul can be thought of as a \u201clow\u201d level of utility, while Um is a \u201cmedium\u201d level of utility and Uh is a \u201chigh\u201d level of utility. All of the choices on indifference curve Uh are preferred to all of the choices on indifference curve Um, which in turn are preferred to all of the choices on Ul.\n\nTo understand why higher indifference curves are preferred to lower ones, compare point B on indifference curve Um to point F on indifference curve Uh. Point F has greater consumption of both books (five to three) and doughnuts (100 to 84), so point F is clearly preferable to point B. Given the definition of an indifference curve\u2014that all the points on the curve have the same level of utility\u2014if point F on indifference curve Uh is preferred to point B on indifference curve Um, then it must be true that all points on indifference curve Uh have a higher level of utility than all points on Um. More generally, for any point on a lower indifference curve, like Ul, you can identify a point on a higher indifference curve like Um or Uh that has a higher consumption of both goods. Since one point on the higher indifference curve is preferred to one point on the lower curve, and since all the points on a given indifference curve have the same level of utility, it must be true that all points on higher indifference curves have greater utility than all points on lower indifference curves.\n\nThese arguments about the shapes of indifference curves and about higher or lower levels of utility do not require any numerical estimates of utility, either by the individual or by anyone else. They are only based on the assumptions that when people have less of one good they need more of another good to make up for it, if they are keeping the same level of utility, and that as people have more of a good, the marginal utility they receive from additional units of that good will diminish. Given these gentle assumptions, a field of indifference curves can be mapped out to describe the preferences of any individual.\n\n**The Individuality of Indifference Curves**\n\nEach person determines their own preferences and utility. Thus, while indifference curves have the same general shape\u2014they slope down, and the slope is steeper on the left and flatter on the right\u2014the specific shape of indifference curves can be different for every person. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_001), for example, applies only to Lilly\u2019s preferences. Indifference curves for other people would probably travel through different points.\n\n### Utility-Maximizing with Indifference Curves\n\nPeople seek the highest level of utility, which means that they wish to be on the highest possible indifference curve. However, people are limited by their budget constraints, which show what tradeoffs are actually possible.\n\n**Maximizing Utility at the Highest Indifference Curve**\n\nReturn to the situation of Lilly\u2019s choice between paperback books and doughnuts. Say that books cost $6, doughnuts are 50 cents each, and that Lilly has $60 to spend. This information provides the basis for the budget line shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_002). Along with the **budget line**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} are shown the three indifference curves from [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_001). What is Lilly\u2019s utility-maximizing choice? Several possibilities are identified in the diagram.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_A06_002 data-title=\"Indifference Curves and a Budget Constraint \"}\n\nThe choice of F with five books and 100 doughnuts is highly desirable, since it is on the highest indifference curve Uh of those shown in the diagram. However, it is not affordable given Lilly\u2019s budget constraint. The choice of H with three books and 70 doughnuts on indifference curve Ul is a wasteful choice, since it is inside Lilly\u2019s budget set, and as a utility-maximizer, Lilly will always prefer a choice on the budget constraint itself. Choices B and G are both on the opportunity set. However, choice G of six books and 48 doughnuts is on lower indifference curve Ul than choice B of three books and 84 doughnuts, which is on the indifference curve Um. If Lilly were to start at choice G, and then thought about whether the marginal utility she was deriving from doughnuts and books, she would decide that some additional doughnuts and fewer books would make her happier\u2014which would cause her to move toward her preferred choice B. Given the combination of Lilly\u2019s personal preferences, as identified by her indifference curves, and Lilly\u2019s opportunity set, which is determined by prices and income, B will be her utility-maximizing choice.\n\nThe highest achievable indifference curve touches the opportunity set at a single point of tangency. Since an infinite number of indifference curves exist, even if only a few of them are drawn on any given diagram, there will always exist one indifference curve that touches the budget line at a single point of tangency. All higher indifference curves, like Uh, will be completely above the budget line and, although the choices on that indifference curve would provide higher utility, they are not affordable given the budget set. All lower indifference curves, like Ul, will cross the budget line in two separate places. When one indifference curve crosses the budget line in two places, however, there will be another, higher, attainable indifference curve sitting above it that touches the budget line at only one point of tangency.\n\n### Changes in Income\n\nA rise in income causes the budget constraint to shift to the right. In graphical terms, the new **budget constraint**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} will now be tangent to a higher indifference curve, representing a higher level of utility. A reduction in income will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left, which will cause it to be tangent to a lower indifference curve, representing a reduced level of utility. If income rises by, for example, 50%, exactly how much will a person alter consumption of books and doughnuts? Will consumption of both goods rise by 50%? Or will the quantity of one good rise substantially, while the quantity of the other good rises only a little, or even declines?\n\nSince personal preferences and the shape of indifference curves are different for each individual, the response to changes in income will be different, too. For example, consider the preferences of Manuel and Natasha in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_013) (a) and [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_013) (b). They each start with an identical income of $40, which they spend on yogurts that cost $1 and rental movies that cost $4. Thus, they face identical budget constraints. However, based on Manuel\u2019s preferences, as revealed by his indifference curves, his utility-maximizing choice on the original budget set occurs where his opportunity set is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve at W, with three movies and 28 yogurts, while Natasha\u2019s utility-maximizing choice on the original budget set at Y will be seven movies and 12 yogurts.\n\n  Manuel&#x2019;s original choice at W involves more yogurt and more movies, and he reacts to the higher income by mainly increasing consumption of movies at X. (b) Conversely, Natasha&#x2019;s original choice (Y) involves relatively more movies, but she reacts to the higher income by choosing relatively more yogurts. Even when budget constraints are the same, personal preferences lead to different original choices and to different reactions in response to a change in income.\"){: #CNX_Econ_A06_013 data-title=\"Manuel and Natasha&#x2019;s Indifference Curves \"}\n\nNow, say that income rises to $60 for both Manuel and Natasha, so their budget constraints shift to the right. As shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_013) (a), Manuel\u2019s new utility maximizing choice at X will be seven movies and 32 yogurts\u2014that is, Manuel will choose to spend most of the extra income on movies. Natasha\u2019s new utility maximizing choice at Z will be eight movies and 28 yogurts\u2014that is, she will choose to spend most of the extra income on yogurt. In this way, the indifference curve approach allows for a range of possible responses. However, if both goods are normal goods, then the typical response to a higher level of income will be to purchase more of them\u2014although exactly how much more is a matter of personal preference. If one of the goods is an inferior good, the response to a higher level of income will be to purchase less of it.\n\n### Responses to Price Changes: Substitution and Income Effects\n\nA higher price for a good will cause the budget constraint to shift to the left, so that it is tangent to a lower indifference curve representing a reduced level of utility. Conversely, a lower price for a good will cause the opportunity set to shift to the right, so that it is tangent to a higher indifference curve representing an increased level of utility. Exactly how much a change in price will lead to the quantity demanded of each good will depend on personal preferences.\n\nAnyone who faces a change in price will experience two interlinked motivations: a substitution effect and an income effect. The **substitution effect**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is that when a good becomes more expensive, people seek out substitutes. If oranges become more expensive, fruit-lovers scale back on oranges and eat more apples, grapefruit, or raisins. Conversely, when a good becomes cheaper, people substitute toward consuming more. If oranges get cheaper, people fire up their juicing machines and ease off on other fruits and foods. The **income effect**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} refers to how a change in the price of a good alters the effective buying power of one\u2019s income. If the price of a good that you have been buying falls, then in effect your buying power has risen\u2014you are able to purchase more goods. Conversely, if the price of a good that you have been buying rises, then the buying power of a given amount of income is diminished. (One common source of confusion is that the \u201cincome effect\u201d does not refer to a change in actual income. Instead, it refers to the situation in which the price of a good changes, and thus the quantities of goods that can be purchased with a fixed amount of income change. It might be more accurate to call the \u201cincome effect\u201d a \u201cbuying power effect,\u201d but the \u201cincome effect\u201d terminology has been used for decades, and it is not going to change during this economics course.) Whenever a price changes, consumers feel the pull of both substitution and income effects at the same time.\n\nUsing indifference curves, you can illustrate the substitution and income effects on a graph. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_005), Ogden faces a choice between two goods: haircuts or personal pizzas. Haircuts cost $20, personal pizzas cost $6, and he has $120 to spend.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_A06_005 data-title=\"Substitution and Income Effects \"}\n\nThe price of haircuts rises to $30. Ogden starts at choice A on the higher **opportunity set**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} and the higher indifference curve. After the price of pizza increases, he chooses B on the lower opportunity set and the lower indifference curve. Point B with two haircuts and 10 personal pizzas is immediately below point A with three haircuts and 10 personal pizzas, showing that Ogden reacted to a higher price of haircuts by cutting back only on haircuts, while leaving his consumption of pizza unchanged.\n\nThe dashed line in the diagram, and point C, are used to separate the substitution effect and the income effect. To understand their function, start by thinking about the substitution effect with this question: How would Ogden change his consumption if the relative prices of the two goods changed, but this change in relative prices did not affect his utility? The slope of the budget constraint is determined by the relative price of the two goods; thus, the slope of the original budget line is determined by the original relative prices, while the slope of the new budget line is determined by the new relative prices. With this thought in mind, the dashed line is a graphical tool inserted in a specific way: It is inserted so that it is parallel with the new budget constraint, so it reflects the new relative prices, but it is tangent to the original indifference curve, so it reflects the original level of utility or buying power.\n\nThus, the movement from the original choice (A) to point C is a substitution effect; it shows the choice that Ogden would make if relative prices shifted (as shown by the different slope between the original budget set and the dashed line) but if buying power did not shift (as shown by being tangent to the original indifference curve). The substitution effect will encourage people to shift away from the good which has become relatively more expensive\u2014in Ogden\u2019s case, the haircuts on the vertical axis\u2014and toward the good which has become relatively less expensive\u2014in this case, the pizza on the vertical axis. The two arrows labeled with \u201cs\u201d for \u201csubstitution effect,\u201d one on each axis, show the direction of this movement.\n\nThe income effect is the movement from point C to B, which shows how Ogden reacts to a reduction in his buying power from the higher indifference curve to the lower indifference curve, but holding constant the relative prices (because the dashed line has the same slope as the new budget constraint). In this case, where the price of one good increases, buying power is reduced, so the income effect means that consumption of both goods should fall (if they are both normal goods, which it is reasonable to assume unless there is reason to believe otherwise). The two arrows labeled with \u201ci\u201d for \u201cincome effect,\u201d one on each axis, show the direction of this income effect movement.\n\nNow, put the substitution and income effects together. When the price of pizza increased, Ogden consumed less of it, for two reasons shown in the exhibit: the substitution effect of the higher price led him to consume less and the income effect of the higher price also led him to consume less. However, when the price of pizza increased, Ogden consumed the same quantity of haircuts. The substitution effect of a higher price for pizza meant that haircuts became relatively less expensive (compared to pizza), and this factor, taken alone, would have encouraged Ogden to consume more haircuts. However, the income effect of a higher price for pizza meant that he wished to consume less of both goods, and this factor, taken alone, would have encouraged Ogden to consume fewer haircuts. As shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_005), in this particular example the substitution effect and income effect on Ogden\u2019s consumption of haircuts are offsetting\u2014so he ends up consuming the same quantity of haircuts after the price increase for pizza as before.\n\nThe size of these income and substitution effects will differ from person to person, depending on individual preferences. For example, if Ogden\u2019s substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is especially strong, and outweighs the income effect, then a higher price for pizza might lead to increased consumption of haircuts. This case would be drawn on the graph so that the point of tangency between the new budget constraint and the relevant indifference curve occurred below point B and to the right. Conversely, if the substitution effect away from pizza and toward haircuts is not as strong, and the income effect on is relatively stronger, then Ogden will be more likely to react to the higher price of pizza by consuming less of both goods. In this case, his optimal choice after the price change will be above and to the left of choice B on the new budget constraint.\n\nAlthough the substitution and income effects are often discussed as a sequence of events, it should be remembered that they are twin components of a single cause\u2014a change in price. Although you can analyze them separately, the two effects are always proceeding hand in hand, happening at the same time.\n\n### Indifference Curves with Labor-Leisure and Intertemporal Choices\n\nThe concept of an indifference curve applies to tradeoffs in any household choice, including the labor-leisure choice or the intertemporal choice between present and future consumption. In the labor-leisure choice, each indifference curve shows the combinations of leisure and income that provide a certain level of utility. In an intertemporal choice, each indifference curve shows the combinations of present and future consumption that provide a certain level of utility. The general shapes of the indifference curves\u2014downward sloping, steeper on the left and flatter on the right\u2014also remain the same.\n\n**A Labor-Leisure Example**\n\nPetunia is working at a job that pays $12 per hour but she gets a raise to $20 per hour. After family responsibilities and sleep, she has 80 hours per week available for work or leisure. As shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_006), the highest level of utility for Petunia, on her original budget constraint, is at choice A, where it is tangent to the lower indifference curve (Ul). Point A has 30 hours of leisure and thus 50 hours per week of work, with income of $600 per week (that is, 50 hours of work at $12 per hour). Petunia then gets a raise to $20 per hour, which shifts her budget constraint to the right. Her new utility-maximizing choice occurs where the new budget constraint is tangent to the higher indifference curve Uh. At B, Petunia has 40 hours of leisure per week and works 40 hours, with income of $800 per week (that is, 40 hours of work at $20 per hour).\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_A06_006 data-title=\"Effects of a Change in Petunia&#x2019;s Wage \"}\n\nSubstitution and income effects provide a vocabulary for discussing how Petunia reacts to a higher hourly wage. The dashed line serves as the tool for separating the two effects on the graph.\n\nThe substitution effect tells how Petunia would have changed her hours of work if her wage had risen, so that income was relatively cheaper to earn and leisure was relatively more expensive, but if she had remained at the same level of utility. The slope of the budget constraint in a **labor-leisure diagram**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is determined by the wage rate. Thus, the dashed line is carefully inserted with the slope of the new opportunity set, reflecting the labor-leisure tradeoff of the new wage rate, but tangent to the original indifference curve, showing the same level of utility or \u201cbuying power.\u201d The shift from original choice A to point C, which is the point of tangency between the original indifference curve and the dashed line, shows that because of the higher wage, Petunia will want to consume less leisure and more income. The \u201cs\u201d arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes of [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_006) show the substitution effect on leisure and on income.\n\nThe income effect is that the higher wage, by shifting the labor-leisure budget constraint to the right, makes it possible for Petunia to reach a higher level of utility. The income effect is the movement from point C to point B; that is, it shows how Petunia\u2019s behavior would change in response to a higher level of utility or \u201cbuying power,\u201d with the wage rate remaining the same (as shown by the dashed line being parallel to the new budget constraint). The income effect, encouraging Petunia to consume both more leisure and more income, is drawn with arrows on the horizontal and vertical axis of [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_006).\n\nPutting these effects together, Petunia responds to the higher wage by moving from choice A to choice B. This movement involves choosing more income, both because the substitution effect of higher wages has made income relatively cheaper or easier to earn, and because the income effect of higher wages has made it possible to have more income and more leisure. Her movement from A to B also involves choosing more leisure because, according to Petunia\u2019s preferences, the income effect that encourages choosing more leisure is stronger than the substitution effect that encourages choosing less leisure.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_006) represents only Petunia\u2019s preferences. Other people might make other choices. For example, a person whose substitution and income effects on leisure exactly counterbalanced each other might react to a higher wage with a choice like D, exactly above the original choice A, which means taking all of the benefit of the higher wages in the form of income while working the same number of hours. Yet another person, whose substitution effect on leisure outweighed the income effect, might react to a higher wage by making a choice like F, where the response to higher wages is to work more hours and earn much more income. To represent these different preferences, you could easily draw the indifference curve Uh to be tangent to the new budget constraint at D or F, rather than at B.\n\n**An Intertemporal Choice Example**\n\nQuentin has saved up $10,000. He is thinking about spending some or all of it on a vacation in the present, and then will save the rest for another big vacation five years from now. Over those five years, he expects to earn a total 80% rate of return. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_007) shows Quentin\u2019s budget constraint and his indifference curves between present consumption and future consumption. The highest level of utility that Quentin can achieve at his original intertemporal budget constraint occurs at point A, where he is consuming $6,000, saving $4,000 for the future, and expecting with the accumulated interest to have $7,200 for future consumption (that is, $4,000 in current financial savings plus the 80% rate of return).\n\nHowever, Quentin has just realized that his expected rate of return was unrealistically high. A more realistic expectation is that over five years he can earn a total return of 30%. In effect, his intertemporal budget constraint has pivoted to the left, so that his original utility-maximizing choice is no longer available. Will Quentin react to the lower rate of return by saving more, or less, or the same amount? Again, the language of substitution and income effects provides a framework for thinking about the motivations behind various choices. The dashed line, which is a graphical tool to separate the substitution and income effect, is carefully inserted with the same slope as the new opportunity set, so that it reflects the changed rate of return, but it is tangent to the original indifference curve, so that it shows no change in utility or \u201cbuying power.\u201d\n\nThe substitution effect tells how Quentin would have altered his consumption because the lower rate of return makes future consumption relatively more expensive and present consumption relatively cheaper. The movement from the original choice A to point C shows how Quentin substitutes toward more present consumption and less future consumption in response to the lower interest rate, with no change in utility. The substitution arrows on the horizontal and vertical axes of [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_007) show the direction of the substitution effect motivation. The substitution effect suggests that, because of the lower interest rate, Quentin should consume more in the present and less in the future.\n\nQuentin also has an income effect motivation. The lower rate of return shifts the budget constraint to the left, which means that Quentin\u2019s utility or \u201cbuying power\u201d is reduced. The income effect (assuming normal goods) encourages less of both present and future consumption. The impact of the income effect on reducing present and future consumption in this example is shown with \u201ci\u201d arrows on the horizontal and vertical axis of [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_007).\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_A06_007 data-title=\"Indifference Curve and an Intertemporal Budget Constraint \"}\n\nTaking both effects together, the substitution effect is encouraging Quentin toward more present and less future consumption, because present consumption is relatively cheaper, while the income effect is encouraging him to less present and less future consumption, because the lower interest rate is pushing him to a lower level of utility. For Quentin\u2019s personal preferences, the substitution effect is stronger so that, overall, he reacts to the lower rate of return with more present consumption and less savings at choice B. However, other people might have different preferences. They might react to a lower rate of return by choosing the same level of present consumption and savings at choice D, or by choosing less present consumption and more savings at a point like F. For these other sets of preferences, the income effect of a lower rate of return on present consumption would be relatively stronger, while the substitution effect would be relatively weaker.\n\n### Sketching Substitution and Income Effects\n\nIndifference curves provide an analytical tool for looking at all the choices that provide a single level of utility. They eliminate any need for placing numerical values on utility and help to illuminate the process of making utility-maximizing decisions. They also provide the basis for a more detailed investigation of the complementary motivations that arise in response to a change in a price, wage or rate of return\u2014namely, the substitution and income effects.\n\nIf you are finding it a little tricky to sketch diagrams that show substitution and income effects so that the points of tangency all come out correctly, it may be useful to follow this procedure.\n\nStep 1. Begin with a budget constraint showing the choice between two goods, which this example will call \u201ccandy\u201d and \u201cmovies.\u201d Choose a point A which will be the optimal choice, where the indifference curve will be tangent\u2014but it is often easier not to draw in the indifference curve just yet. See [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_008).\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_A06_008 data-title=\"\"}\n\nStep 2. Now the price of movies changes: let\u2019s say that it rises. That shifts the budget set inward. You know that the higher price will push the decision-maker down to a lower level of utility, represented by a lower indifference curve. But at this stage, draw only the new budget set. See [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_009).\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_A06_009 data-title=\"\"}\n\nStep 3. The key tool in distinguishing between substitution and income effects is to insert a dashed line, parallel to the new budget line. This line is a graphical tool that allows you to distinguish between the two changes: (1) the effect on consumption of the two goods of the shift in prices\u2014with the level of utility remaining unchanged\u2014which is the substitution effect; and (2) the effect on consumption of the two goods of shifting from one indifference curve to the other\u2014with relative prices staying unchanged\u2014which is the income effect. The dashed line is inserted in this step. The trick is to have the dashed line travel close to the original choice A, but not directly through point A. See [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_010).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_A06_010 data-title=\"\"}\n\nStep 4. Now, draw the original indifference curve, so that it is tangent to both point A on the original budget line and to a point C on the dashed line. Many students find it easiest to first select the tangency point C where the original indifference curve touches the dashed line, and then to draw the original indifference curve through A and C. The substitution effect is illustrated by the movement along the original indifference curve as prices change but the level of utility holds constant, from A to C. As expected, the substitution effect leads to less consumed of the good that is relatively more expensive, as shown by the \u201cs\u201d (substitution) arrow on the vertical axis, and more consumed of the good that is relatively less expensive, as shown by the \u201cs\u201d arrow on the horizontal axis. See [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_011).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_A06_011 data-title=\"\"}\n\nStep 5. With the substitution effect in place, now choose utility-maximizing point B on the new opportunity set. When you choose point B, think about whether you wish the substitution or the income effect to have a larger impact on the good (in this case, candy) on the horizontal axis. If you choose point B to be directly in a vertical line with point A (as is illustrated here), then the income effect will be exactly offsetting the substitution effect on the horizontal axis. If you insert point B so that it lies a little to right of the original point A, then the substitution effect will exceed the income effect. If you insert point B so that it lies a little to the left of point A, then the income effect will exceed the substitution effect. The income effect is the movement from C to B, showing how choices shifted as a result of the decline in buying power and the movement between two levels of utility, with relative prices remaining the same. With normal goods, the negative income effect means less consumed of each good, as shown by the direction of the \u201ci\u201d (income effect) arrows on the vertical and horizontal axes. See [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_A06_012).\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_A06_012 data-title=\"\"}\n\nIn sketching substitution and income effect diagrams, you may wish to practice some of the following variations: (1) Price falls instead of a rising; (2) The price change affects the good on either the vertical or the horizontal axis; (3) Sketch these diagrams so that the substitution effect exceeds the income effect; the income effect exceeds the substitution effect; and the two effects are equal.\n\nOne final note: The helpful dashed line can be drawn tangent to the new indifference curve, and parallel to the original budget line, rather than tangent to the original indifference curve and parallel to the new budget line. Some students find this approach more intuitively clear. The answers you get about the direction and relative sizes of the substitution and income effects, however, should be the same.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nAn indifference curve is drawn on a budget constraint diagram that shows the tradeoffs between two goods. All points along a single indifference curve provide the same level of utility. Higher indifference curves represent higher levels of utility. Indifference curves slope downward because, if utility is to remain the same at all points along the curve, a reduction in the quantity of the good on the vertical axis must be counterbalanced by an increase in the quantity of the good on the horizontal axis (or vice versa). Indifference curves are steeper on the far left and flatter on the far right, because of diminishing marginal utility.\n\nThe utility-maximizing choice along a budget constraint will be the point of tangency where the budget constraint touches an indifference curve at a single point. A change in the price of any good has two effects: a substitution effect and an income effect. The substitution effect motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to buy less of what is relatively more expensive and more of what is relatively cheaper. The income effect motivation encourages a utility-maximizer to buy more of both goods if utility rises or less of both goods if utility falls (if they are both normal goods).\n\nIn a labor-leisure choice, every wage change has a substitution and an income effect. The substitution effect of a wage increase is to choose more income, since it is cheaper to earn, and less leisure, since its opportunity cost has increased. The income effect of a wage increase is to choose more of leisure and income, since they are both normal goods. The substitution and income effects of a wage decrease would reverse these directions.\n\nIn an intertemporal consumption choice, every interest rate change has a substitution and an income effect. The substitution effect of an interest rate increase is to choose more future consumption, since it is now cheaper to earn future consumption and less present consumption (more savings), since the opportunity cost of present consumption in terms of what is being given up in the future has increased. The income effect of an interest rate increase is to choose more of both present and future consumption, since they are both normal goods. The substitution and income effects of an interest rate decrease would reverse these directions.\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat point is preferred along an indifference curve?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do indifference curves slope down?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are indifference curves steep on the left and flatter on the right?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many indifference curves does a person have?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can you tell which indifference curves represent higher or lower levels of utility?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a substitution effect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is an income effect?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the \u201cincome effect\u201d involve a change in income?

The price of a bond depends on the future payments that the bond is expected to make, including both payments of interest and the repayment of the face value of the bond. The price of a stock depends on the expected future profits earned by the firm. The concept of a **present discounted value (PDV)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which is defined as the amount you should be willing to pay in the present for a stream of expected future payments, can be used to calculate appropriate prices for stocks and bonds. To place a present discounted value on a future payment, think about what amount of money you would need to have in the present to equal a certain amount in the future. This calculation will require an **interest rate**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. For example, if the interest rate is 10%, then a payment of $110 a year from now will have a present discounted value of $100\u2014that is, you could take $100 in the present and have $110 in the future. We will first shows how to apply the idea of present discounted value to a stock and then we will show how to apply it to a bond.\n\n### Applying Present Discounted Value to a Stock\n\nConsider the case of Babble, Inc., a company that offers speaking lessons. For the sake of simplicity, say that the founder of Babble is 63 years old and plans to retire in two years, at which point the company will be disbanded. The company is selling 200 shares of stock and profits are expected to be $15 million right away, in the present, $20 million one year from now, and $25 million two years from now. All profits will be paid out as dividends to shareholders as they occur. Given this information, what will an investor pay for a share of stock in this company?\n\nA financial investor, thinking about what future payments are worth in the present, will need to choose an interest rate. This interest rate will reflect the rate of return on other available financial investment opportunities, which is the opportunity cost of investing financial capital, and also a risk premium (that is, using a higher interest rate than the rates available elsewhere if this investment appears especially risky). In this example, say that the financial investor decides that appropriate interest rate to value these future payments is 15%.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_D_01) shows how to calculate the present discounted value of the future profits. For each time period, when a benefit is going to be received, apply the formula:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Present\u00a0discounted\u00a0value\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext><mfrac><mtext>Future\u00a0value\u00a0received\u00a0years\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0future</mtext><msup><mtext>(1\u00a0+\u00a0Interest\u00a0rate)</mtext><mtext>numbers\u00a0of\u00a0years\u00a0t</mtext></msup></mfrac></math>\n\n\n<table id=\"Table_D_01\" summary=\"The table has 2 columns.

The present value calculations ask what the amount in the future is worth in the present, given the 15% interest rate. Notice that a different PDV calculation needs to be done separately for amounts received at different times. Then, divide the PDV of total profits by the number of shares, 200 in this case: 51.3 million/200 = 0.2565 million. The price per share should be about $256,500 per share.\n\nOf course, in the real world expected profits are a best guess, not a hard piece of data. Deciding which interest rate to apply for discounting to the present can be tricky. One needs to take into account both potential capital gains from the future sale of the stock and also dividends that might be paid. Differences of opinion on these issues are exactly why some financial investors want to buy a stock that other people want to sell: they are more optimistic about its future prospects. Conceptually, however, it all comes down to what you are willing to pay in the present for a stream of benefits to be received in the future.\n\n### Applying Present Discounted Value to a Bond\n\nA similar calculation works in the case of bonds. [Financial Markets](/m48697){: .target-chapter} explains that if the interest rate falls after a bond is issued, so that the investor has locked in a higher rate, then that bond will sell for more than its face value. Conversely, if the interest rate rises after a bond is issued, then the investor is locked into a lower rate, and the bond will sell for less than its face value. The present value calculation sharpens this intuition.\n\nThink about a simple two-year bond. It was issued for $3,000 at an interest rate of 8%. Thus, after the first year, the bond pays interest of 240 (which is 3,000 \u00d7 8%). At the end of the second year, the bond pays $240 in interest, plus the $3,000 in principle. Calculate how much this bond is worth in the present if the discount rate is 8%. Then, recalculate if interest rates rise and the applicable discount rate is 11%. To carry out these calculations, look at the stream of payments being received from the bond in the future and figure out what they are worth in present discounted value terms. The calculations applying the present value formula are shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_D_02).\n\n<table id=\"Table_D_02\" summary=\"The table has four columns. Column 1 is labeled &#x201C;stream of payments (for the 8% interest rate).&#x201D; Column 2 is labeled &#x201C;present value (for the 8% interest rate).&#x201D; Column 3 is labeled &#x201C;stream of payments for the 11% interest rate).&#x201D; Column 4 is labeled &#x201C;present value (for the 11% interest rate).&#x201D; Row 1: stream of payments for 8% = $240 payment after one year; present value for 8% is the equation: $240 divided by [(1 +0.08) to the first power] = $222.20; stream of payments for 11% = $240 payment after one year; present value for 11% is the equation: $240 divided by [(1 + 0.11) to the first power] = $216.20.

After all, that is how much money the borrower is receiving. The calculation confirms that the present value is the same for the lender. The bond is moving money around in time, from those willing to save in the present to those who want to borrow in the present, but the present value of what is received by the borrower is identical to the present value of what will be repaid to the lender.\n\nThe second calculation shows what happens if the interest rate rises from 8% to 11%. The actual dollar payments in the first column, as determined by the 8% interest rate, do not change. However, the present value of those payments, now discounted at a higher interest rate, is lower. Even though the future dollar payments that the bond is receiving have not changed, a person who tries to sell the bond will find that the investment\u2019s value has fallen.\n\nAgain, real-world calculations are often more complex, in part because, not only the interest rate prevailing in the market, but also the riskiness of whether the borrower will repay the loan, will change. In any case, the price of a bond is always the present value of a stream of future expected payments.\n\n### Other Applications\n\nPresent discounted value is a widely used analytical tool outside the world of finance. Every time a business thinks about making a physical capital investment, it must compare a set of present costs of making that investment to the present discounted value of future benefits. When government thinks about a proposal to, for example, add safety features to a highway, it must compare costs incurred in the present to benefits received in the future. Some academic disputes over environmental policies, like how much to reduce carbon dioxide emissions because of the risk that they will lead to a warming of global temperatures several decades in the future, turn on how one compares present costs of pollution control with long-run future benefits. Someone who wins the lottery and is scheduled to receive a string of payments over 30 years might be interested in knowing what the present discounted value is of those payments. Whenever a string of costs and benefits stretches from the present into different times in the future, present discounted value becomes an indispensable tool of analysis.", "key_terms": [], "subject_id": "economics"}

The fundamental ideas of Keynesian economics were developed before the AD/AS model was popularized. From the 1930s until the 1970s, Keynesian economics was usually explained with a different model, known as the expenditure-output approach. This approach is strongly rooted in the fundamental assumptions of Keynesian economics: it focuses on the total amount of spending in the economy, with no explicit mention of aggregate supply or of the price level (although as you will see, it is possible to draw some inferences about aggregate supply and price levels based on the diagram).\n\n### The Axes of the Expenditure-Output Diagram\n\nThe **expenditure-output model**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, sometimes also called the **Keynesian cross diagram**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, determines the equilibrium level of real GDP by the point where the total or aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the amount of output produced. The axes of the Keynesian cross diagram presented in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_011) show real GDP on the horizontal axis as a measure of output and aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis as a measure of spending.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C25_011 data-title=\"The Expenditure-Output Diagram \"}\n\nRemember that GDP can be thought of in several equivalent ways: it measures both the value of spending on final goods and also the value of the production of final goods. All sales of the final goods and services that make up GDP will eventually end up as income for workers, for managers, and for investors and owners of firms. The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is called **national income**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} (Y). At some points in the discussion that follows, it will be useful to refer to real GDP as \u201cnational income.\u201d Both axes are measured in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.\n\n**The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line**\n\nThe Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion. The first is a vertical line showing the level of **potential GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Potential GDP means the same thing here that it means in the AD/AS diagrams: it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of its labor and physical capital.\n\nThe second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line, which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the right. A line that stretches up at a 45-degree angle represents the set of points (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) and so on, where the measurement on the vertical axis is equal to the measurement on the horizontal axis. In this diagram, the 45-degree line shows the set of points where the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy, measured on the vertical axis, is equal to the level of output or national income in the economy, measured by GDP on the horizontal axis.\n\nWhen the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the **real GDP**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\u2014because by definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy. Thus, the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal\u2014which will only occur along the 45-degree line.\n\n**The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule**\n\nThe final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure-output diagram is the **aggregate expenditure schedule**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line\u2014at point E<sub>0</sub> in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_011)\u2014will show the equilibrium for the economy, because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP. After developing an understanding of what the aggregate expenditures schedule means, we will return to this equilibrium and how to interpret it.\n\n### Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule\n\nAggregate expenditure is the key to the expenditure-income model. The aggregate expenditure schedule shows, either in the form of a table or a graph, how aggregate expenditures in the economy rise as real GDP or national income rises. Thus, in thinking about the components of the aggregate expenditure line\u2014consumption, investment, government spending, exports and imports\u2014the key question is how expenditures in each category will adjust as national income rises.\n\n**Consumption as a Function of National Income**\n\nHow do consumption expenditures increase as national income rises? People can do two things with their income: consume it or save it (for the moment, let\u2019s ignore the need to pay taxes with some of it). Each person who receives an additional dollar faces this choice. The **marginal propensity to consume (MPC)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures. The **marginal propensity to save (MPS)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save. It must always hold true that:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>MPC\u00a0+\u00a0MPS\u00a0=\u00a01</mtext></math>\n\n\nFor example, if the marginal propensity to consume out of the marginal amount of income earned is 0.9, then the marginal propensity to save is 0.1.\n\nWith this relationship in mind, consider the relationship among income, consumption, and savings shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_012). (Note that we use \u201cAggregate Expenditure\u201d on the vertical axis in this and the following figures, because all consumption expenditures are parts of aggregate expenditures.)\n\nAn assumption commonly made in this model is that even if income were zero, people would have to consume something. In this example, consumption would be $600 even if income were zero. Then, the MPC is 0.8 and the MPS is 0.2. Thus, when income increases by $1,000, consumption rises by $800 and savings rises by $200. At an income of $4,000, total consumption will be the $600 that would be consumed even without any income, plus $4,000 multiplied by the marginal propensity to consume of 0.8, or $ 3,200, for a total of $ 3,800. The total amount of consumption and saving must always add up to the total amount of income. (Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important, because even low-income societies are not literally at zero income, so the point is hypothetical.) This relationship between income and consumption, illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_012) and [\\[link\\]](#Table_E_01), is called the **consumption function**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C25_012 data-title=\"The Consumption Function \"}\n\nThe pattern of consumption shown in [\\[link\\]](#Table_E_01) is plotted in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_012). To calculate consumption, multiply the income level by 0.8, for the marginal propensity to consume, and add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income was zero. Consumption plus savings must be equal to income.\n\n<table id=\"Table_E_01\" summary=\"The table shows the income, consumption, and savings data needed to calculate consumption.

These factors were summarized in the earlier discussion of consumption, and listed in [\\[link\\]](#Table_E_01). When the consumption function moves, it can shift in two ways: either the entire consumption function can move up or down in a parallel manner, or the slope of the consumption function can shift so that it becomes steeper or flatter. For example, if a tax cut leads consumers to spend more, but does not affect their marginal propensity to consume, it would cause an upward shift to a new consumption function that is parallel to the original one. However, a change in household preferences for saving that reduced the marginal propensity to save would cause the slope of the consumption function to become steeper: that is, if the savings rate is lower, then every increase in income leads to a larger rise in consumption.\n\n**Investment as a Function of National Income**\n\nInvestment decisions are forward-looking, based on expected rates of return. Precisely because investment decisions depend primarily on perceptions about future economic conditions, they do *not* depend primarily on the level of GDP in the current year. Thus, on a Keynesian cross diagram, the investment function can be drawn as a horizontal line, at a fixed level of expenditure. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_013) shows an investment function where the level of investment is, for the sake of concreteness, set at the specific level of 500. Just as a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP (or national income), the **investment function**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} shows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C25_013 data-title=\"The Investment Function \"}\n\nThe appearance of the investment function as a horizontal line does not mean that the level of investment never moves. It means only that in the context of this two-dimensional diagram, the level of investment on the vertical aggregate expenditure axis does not vary according to the current level of real GDP on the horizontal axis. However, all the other factors that vary investment\u2014new technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, interest rates, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment\u2014can cause the horizontal investment function to shift up or down.\n\n**Government Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income**\n\nIn the Keynesian cross diagram, government spending appears as a horizontal line, as in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_014), where government spending is set at a level of 1,300. As in the case of investment spending, this horizontal line does not mean that government spending is unchanging. It means only that government spending changes when Congress decides on a change in the budget, rather than shifting in a predictable way with the current size of the real GDP shown on the horizontal axis.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C25_014 data-title=\"The Government Spending Function \"}\n\nThe situation of taxes is different because taxes often rise or fall with the volume of economic activity. For example, income taxes are based on the level of income earned and sales taxes are based on the amount of sales made, and both income and sales tend to be higher when the economy is growing and lower when the economy is in a recession. For the purposes of constructing the basic Keynesian cross diagram, it is helpful to view taxes as a proportionate share of GDP. In the United States, for example, taking federal, state, and local taxes together, government typically collects about 30\u201335 % of income as taxes.\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_E_02) revises the earlier table on the consumption function so that it takes taxes into account. The first column shows national income. The second column calculates taxes, which in this example are set at a rate of 30%, or 0.3. The third column shows after-tax income; that is, total income minus taxes. The fourth column then calculates consumption in the same manner as before: multiply after-tax income by 0.8, representing the marginal propensity to consume, and then add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income was zero. When taxes are included, the marginal propensity to consume is reduced by the amount of the tax rate, so each additional dollar of income results in a smaller increase in consumption than before taxes. For this reason, the consumption function, with taxes included, is flatter than the consumption function without taxes, as [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_015) shows.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C25_015 data-title=\"The Consumption Function Before and After Taxes \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_E_02\" summary=\"The table shows the income, consumption, tax, and savings data needed to calculate consumption before and after taxes.

Again, as in the case of investment spending and government spending, drawing the export function as horizontal does not imply that exports never change. It just means that they do not change because of what is on the horizontal axis\u2014that is, a country\u2019s own level of domestic production\u2014and instead are shaped by the level of aggregate demand in other countries. More demand for exports from other countries would cause the export function to shift up; less demand for exports from other countries would cause it to shift down.\n\n  The export function is drawn as a horizontal line because exports are determined by the buying power of other countries and thus do not change with the size of the domestic economy. In this example, exports are set at 840. However, exports can shift up or down, depending on buying patterns in other countries. (b) The import function is drawn in negative territory because expenditures on imported products are a subtraction from expenditures in the domestic economy. In this example, the marginal propensity to import is 0.1, so imports are calculated by multiplying the level of income by &#x2013;0.1.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C25_025 data-title=\"The Export and Import Functions \"}\n\nImports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward-sloping line, with the downward slope determined by the **marginal propensity to import (MPI)**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, out of national income. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_025) (b), the marginal propensity to import is 0.1. Thus, if real GDP is $5,000, imports are $500; if national income is $6,000, imports are $600, and so on. The import function is drawn as downward sloping and negative, because it represents a subtraction from the aggregate expenditures in the domestic economy. A change in the marginal propensity to import, perhaps as a result of changes in preferences, would alter the slope of the import function.\n\n\n\nUsing an Algebraic Approach to the Expenditure-Output Model\n\nIn the expenditure-output or Keynesian cross model, the equilibrium occurs where the aggregate expenditure line (AE line) crosses the 45-degree line. Given algebraic equations for two lines, the point where they cross can be readily calculated. Imagine an economy with the following characteristics.\n\nY = Real GDP or national income\n\nT = Taxes = 0.3Y\n\nC = Consumption = 140 + 0.9(Y \u2013 T)\n\nI = Investment = 400\n\nG = Government spending = 800\n\nX = Exports = 600\n\nM = Imports = 0.15Y\n\nStep 1. Determine the aggregate expenditure function. In this case, it is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>AE</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>C\u00a0+\u00a0I\u00a0+\u00a0G\u00a0+\u00a0X\u00a0\u2013\u00a0M</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>AE</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>140\u00a0+\u00a00.9(Y\u00a0\u2013\u00a0T)\u00a0+\u00a0400\u00a0+\u00a0800\u00a0+\u00a0600\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.15Y</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 2. The equation for the 45-degree line is the set of points where GDP or national income on the horizontal axis is equal to aggregate expenditure on the vertical axis. Thus, the equation for the 45-degree line is: AE = Y.\n\nStep 3. The next step is to solve these two equations for Y (or AE, since they will be equal to each other).

In this case, let the economic parameters be:\n\nY = National income\n\nT = Taxes = 0.3Y\n\nC = Consumption = 200 + 0.9(Y \u2013 T)\n\nI = Investment = 600\n\nG = Government spending = 1,000\n\nX = Exports = 600\n\nY = Imports = 0.1(Y \u2013 T)\n\nStep 8. Calculate the equilibrium for this economy (remember Y = AE).\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Y</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>200\u00a0+\u00a00.9(Y\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.3Y)\u00a0+\u00a0600\u00a0+\u00a01000\u00a0+\u00a0600\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.1(Y\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.3Y)</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Y\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.63Y\u00a0+\u00a00.07Y</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>2400</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>0.44Y</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>2400</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Y</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>5454</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 9. Assume that the full employment level of output is 6,000. What level of government spending would be necessary to reach that level? To answer this question, plug in 6,000 as equal to Y, but leave G as a variable, and solve for G. Thus:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>6000\u00a0=\u00a0200\u00a0+\u00a00.9(6000\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.3(6000))\u00a0+\u00a0600\u00a0+\u00a0G\u00a0+\u00a0600\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.1(6000\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.3(6000))</mtext></math>\n\nStep 10. Solve this problem arithmetically. The answer is: G = 1,240. In other words, increasing government spending by 240, from its original level of 1,000, to 1,240, would raise output to the full employment level of GDP.\n\nIndeed, the question of how much to increase government spending so that equilibrium output will rise from 5,454 to 6,000 can be answered without working through the algebra, just by using the multiplier formula. The multiplier equation in this case is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mfrac><mtext>1</mtext><mtext>1\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.56</mtext></mfrac></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>2.27</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"left\"><mtr /><mtr /><mtr /><mtr /></mtable><mspace linebreak=\"newline\" /></math>\n\nThus, to raise output by 546 would require an increase in government spending of 546/2.27=240, which is the same as the answer derived from the algebraic calculation.\n\nThis algebraic framework is highly flexible. For example, taxes can be treated as a total set by political considerations (like government spending) and not dependent on national income. Imports might be based on before-tax income, not after-tax income. For certain purposes, it may be helpful to analyze the economy without exports and imports. A more complicated approach could divide up consumption, investment, government, exports and imports into smaller categories, or to build in some variability in the rates of taxes, savings, and imports. A wise economist will shape the model to fit the specific question under investigation.\n\n\n\n**Building the Combined Aggregate Expenditure Function**\n\nAll the components of **aggregate demand**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\u2014consumption, investment, government spending, and the trade balance\u2014are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_018) builds up an aggregate expenditure function, based on the numerical illustrations of C, I, G, X, and M that have been used throughout this text. The first three columns in [\\[link\\]](#Table_E_03) are lifted from the earlier [\\[link\\]](#Table_E_02), which showed how to bring taxes into the consumption function. The first column is real GDP or national income, which is what appears on the horizontal axis of the income-expenditure diagram. The second column calculates after-tax income, based on the assumption, in this case, that 30% of real GDP is collected in taxes. The third column is based on an MPC of 0.8, so that as after-tax income rises by $700 from one row to the next, consumption rises by $560 (700 \u00d7 0.8) from one row to the next. Investment, government spending, and exports do not change with the level of current national income. In the previous discussion, investment was $500, government spending was $1,300, and exports were $840, for a total of $2,640. This total is shown in the fourth column. Imports are 0.1 of real GDP in this example, and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column. The final column, **aggregate expenditures**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}, sums up C + I + G + X \u2013 M. This **aggregate expenditure line**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is illustrated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_018).\n\n  is graphed. The equilibrium occurs where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income; this occurs where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line, at a real GDP of $6,000. Potential GDP in this example is $7,000, so the equilibrium is occurring at a level of output or real GDP below the potential GDP level.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C25_018 data-title=\"A Keynesian Cross Diagram \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_E_03\" summary=\"The table shows the data for national income-aggregate expenditure equilibrium.

The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures\u2014which do not vary with national income. The upward slope of the aggregate expenditure function will be determined by the marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, and the marginal propensity to import. A higher marginal propensity to save, a higher tax rate, and a higher marginal propensity to import will all make the slope of the aggregate expenditure function flatter\u2014because out of any extra income, more is going to savings or taxes or imports and less to spending on domestic goods and services.\n\nThe equilibrium occurs where national income is equal to aggregate expenditure, which is shown on the graph as the point where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line. In this example, the equilibrium occurs at 6,000. This equilibrium can also be read off the table under the figure; it is the level of national income where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income.\n\n### Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Model\n\nWith the aggregate expenditure line in place, the next step is to relate it to the two other elements of the Keynesian cross diagram. Thus, the first subsection interprets the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line, while the next subsection relates this point of intersection to the potential GDP line.\n\n**Where Equilibrium Occurs**\n\nThe point where the aggregate expenditure line that is constructed from C + I + G + X \u2013 M crosses the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium for the economy. It is the only point on the aggregate expenditure line where the total amount being spent on aggregate demand equals the total level of production. In [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_018), this point of equilibrium (E<sub>0</sub>) happens at 6,000, which can also be read off [\\[link\\]](#Table_E_03).\n\nThe meaning of \u201cequilibrium\u201d remains the same; that is, **equilibrium**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis} is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome. To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium, consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E, say point H in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_019), where output is higher than the equilibrium. At point H, the level of aggregate expenditure is below the 45-degree line, so that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is less than the level of output. As a result, at point H, output is piling up unsold\u2014not a sustainable state of affairs.\n\n  must lie on the 45-degree line, which is the set of points where national income and aggregate expenditure are equal.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C25_019 data-title=\"Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Diagram \"}\n\nConversely, consider the situation where the level of output is at point L\u2014where real output is lower than the equilibrium. In that case, the level of aggregate demand in the economy is above the 45-degree line, indicating that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is greater than the level of output. When the level of aggregate demand has emptied the store shelves, it cannot be sustained, either. Firms will respond by increasing their level of production. Thus, the equilibrium must be the point where the amount produced and the amount spent are in balance, at the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line.\n\n\n\nFinding Equilibrium\n\n[\\[link\\]](#Table_E_04) gives some information on an economy. The Keynesian model assumes that there is some level of consumption even without income. That amount is $236 \u2013 $216 = $20. $20 will be consumed when national income equals zero. Assume that taxes are 0.2 of real GDP. Let the marginal propensity to save of after-tax income be 0.1. The level of investment is $70, the level of government spending is $80, and the level of exports is $50. Imports are 0.2 of after-tax income. Given these values, you need to complete [\\[link\\]](#Table_E_04) and then answer these questions:\n\n* What is the consumption function?\n* What is the equilibrium?\n* Why is a national income of $300 not at equilibrium?\n* How do expenditures and output compare at this point?\n\n| National Income | Taxes | After-tax income | Consumption | I + G + X | Imports | Aggregate Expenditures |\n|----------\n| $300 |  |  | $236 |  |  |  |\n| $400 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| $500 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| $600 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| $700 |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n{: #Table_E_04 summary=\"The table shows information needed to find equilibrium, as well as space for filling in the final values.

Calculate consumption. The marginal propensity to save is given as 0.1. This means that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.9, since MPS + MPC = 1. Therefore, multiply 0.9 by the after-tax income amount using the following as an example:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnalign=\"left center center right\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>After-tax\u00a0Income</mtext></mtd><mtd /><mtd /><mtd><mtext>$240</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>MPC</mtext></mtd><mtd /><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00d7\u00a00.9</mtext></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd><mtext>Consumption</mtext></mtd><mtd /><mtd /><mtd><mtext>$216</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\nStep 4.

That amount is $236 \u2013 $216 = $20.\n\nStep 5. There is now enough information to write the consumption function. The consumption function is found by figuring out the level of consumption that will happen when income is zero.

Use the consumption function to find consumption at each level of national income.\n\nStep 7. Add investment (I), government spending (G), and exports (X). Remember that these do not change as national income changes:\n\nStep 8. Find imports, which are 0.2 of after-tax income at each level of national income.

Answer this question: Why is a national income of $300 not an equilibrium? At national income of $300, aggregate expenditures are $388.\n\nStep 13. Answer this question: How do expenditures and output compare at this point? Aggregate expenditures cannot exceed output (GDP) in the long run, since there would not be enough goods to be bought.\n\n\n\n**Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps**\n\nIn the Keynesian cross diagram, if the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at the level of potential GDP, then the economy is in sound shape. There is no recession, and unemployment is low. But there is no guarantee that the equilibrium will occur at the potential GDP level of output. The equilibrium might be higher or lower.\n\nFor example, [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_026) (a) illustrates a situation where the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at point E<sub>0</sub>, which is a real GDP of $6,000, and which is below the potential GDP of $7,000. In this situation, the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level, and unemployment will occur. The distance between an output level like E<sub>0</sub> that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is called a **recessionary gap**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low, firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers, and unemployment will be high.\n\n  If the equilibrium occurs at an output below potential GDP, then a recessionary gap exists. The policy solution to a recessionary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule up from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax cuts or government spending increases. Then the new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential GDP. (b) If the equilibrium occurs at an output above potential GDP, then an inflationary gap exists. The policy solution to an inflationary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule down from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax increases or spending cuts. Then, the new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential GDP.\"){: #CNX_Econ_C25_026 data-title=\"Addressing Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps \"}\n\nWhat might cause a recessionary gap? Anything that shifts the aggregate expenditure line down is a potential cause of recession, including a decline in consumption, a rise in savings, a fall in investment, a drop in government spending or a rise in taxes, or a fall in exports or a rise in imports. Moreover, an economy that is at equilibrium with a recessionary gap may just stay there and suffer high unemployment for a long time; remember, the meaning of equilibrium is that there is no particular adjustment of prices or quantities in the economy to chase the recession away.\n\nThe appropriate response to a recessionary gap is for the government to reduce taxes or increase spending so that the aggregate expenditure function shifts up from AE<sub>0</sub> to AE<sub>1</sub>. When this shift occurs, the new equilibrium E<sub>1</sub> now occurs at potential GDP as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_026) (a).\n\nConversely, [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_026) (b) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule (AE<sub>0</sub>) intersects the 45-degree line above potential GDP. The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E<sub>0</sub> and potential GDP is called an **inflationary gap**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}. The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting. After all, a na\u00efve reading of the Keynesian cross diagram might suggest that if the aggregate expenditure function is just pushed up high enough, real GDP can be as large as desired\u2014even doubling or tripling the potential GDP level of the economy. This implication is clearly wrong. An economy faces some supply-side limits on how much it can produce at a given time with its existing quantities of workers, physical and human capital, technology, and market institutions.\n\nThe inflationary gap should be interpreted, not as a literal prediction of how large real GDP will be, but as a statement of how much extra aggregate expenditure is in the economy beyond what is needed to reach potential GDP. An inflationary gap suggests that because the economy cannot produce enough goods and services to absorb this level of aggregate expenditures, the spending will instead cause an inflationary increase in the price level. In this way, even though changes in the price level do not appear explicitly in the Keynesian cross equation, the notion of inflation is implicit in the concept of the inflationary gap.\n\nThe appropriate Keynesian response to an inflationary gap is shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_026) (b). The original intersection of aggregate expenditure line AE<sub>0</sub> and the 45-degree line occurs at $8,000, which is above the level of potential GDP at $7,000. If AE<sub>0</sub> shifts down to AE<sub>1</sub>, so that the new equilibrium is at E<sub>1</sub>, then the economy will be at potential GDP without pressures for inflationary price increases. The government can achieve a downward shift in aggregate expenditure by increasing taxes on consumers or firms, or by reducing government expenditures.\n\n### The Multiplier Effect\n\nThe Keynesian policy prescription has one final twist. Assume that for a certain economy, the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is at a GDP of 700, while the level of potential GDP for this economy is $800. By how much does government spending need to be increased so that the economy reaches the full employment GDP? The obvious answer might seem to be $800 \u2013 $700 = $100; so raise government spending by $100. But that answer is incorrect. A change of, for example, $100 in government expenditures will have an effect of more than $100 on the equilibrium level of real GDP. The reason is that a change in aggregate expenditures circles through the economy: households buy from firms, firms pay workers and suppliers, workers and suppliers buy goods from other firms, those firms pay their workers and suppliers, and so on. In this way, the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once. This is called the **multiplier effect**{: data-type=\"term\" .no-emphasis}\\: An initial increase in spending, cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent.\n\n**How Does the Multiplier Work?**\n\nTo understand how the multiplier effect works, return to the example in which the current equilibrium in the Keynesian cross diagram is a real GDP of $700, or $100 short of the $800 needed to be at full employment, potential GDP. If the government spends $100 to close this gap, someone in the economy receives that spending and can treat it as income. Assume that those who receive this income pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, spend 10% of total income on imports, and then spend the rest on domestically produced goods and services.\n\nAs shown in the calculations in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_022) and [\\[link\\]](#Table_E_06), out of the original $100 in government spending, $53 is left to spend on domestically produced goods and services. That $53 which was spent, becomes income to someone, somewhere in the economy. Those who receive that income also pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, and spend 10% of total income on imports, as shown in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_022), so that an additional $28.09 (that is, 0.53 \u00d7 $53) is spent in the third round. The people who receive that income then pay taxes, save, and buy imports, and the amount spent in the fourth round is $14.89 (that is, 0.53 \u00d7 $28.09).\n\n{: #CNX_Econ_C25_022 data-title=\"The Multiplier Effect \"}\n\n<table id=\"Table_E_06\" summary=\"The table shows information needed to calculate the multiplier effect.

[\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_022) shows these total aggregate expenditures after these first four rounds, and then the figure shows the total aggregate expenditures after 30 rounds. The additional boost to aggregate expenditures is shrinking in each round of consumption. After about 10 rounds, the additional increments are very small indeed\u2014nearly invisible to the naked eye. After 30 rounds, the additional increments in each round are so small that they have no practical consequence. After 30 rounds, the cumulative value of the initial boost in aggregate expenditure is approximately $213. Thus, the government spending increase of $100 eventually, after many cycles, produced an increase of $213 in aggregate expenditure and real GDP. In this example, the multiplier is $213/$100 = 2.13.\n\n**Calculating the Multiplier**\n\nFortunately for everyone who is not carrying around a computer with a spreadsheet program to project the impact of an original increase in expenditures over 20, 50, or 100 rounds of spending, there is a formula for calculating the multiplier.\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtext>Spending\u00a0Multiplier\u00a0=\u00a01/(1\u00a0\u2013\u00a0MPC\u00a0*\u00a0(1\u00a0\u2013\u00a0tax\u00a0rate)\u00a0+\u00a0MPI)</mtext><mo>\u00a0</mo></math>\n\n\nThe data from [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_022) and [\\[link\\]](#Table_E_06) is:\n\n* Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) = 30%\n* Tax rate = 10%\n* Marginal Propensity to Import (MPI) = 10%\n\nThe MPC is equal to 1 \u2013 MPS, or 0.7. Therefore, the spending multiplier is:\n\n\n<math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mtable columnspacing=\"2px\" columnalign=\"right center left\"><mtr><mtd><mtext>Spending\u00a0Multiplier</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>1</mtext><mtext>1\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(0.7\u00a0\u2013\u00a0(0.10)(0.7)\u00a0\u2013\u00a00.10)</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mfrac><mtext>1</mtext><mtext>0.47</mtext></mfrac></mtd></mtr><mtr><mtd /><mtd><mtext>\u00a0=\u00a0</mtext></mtd><mtd><mtext>2.13</mtext></mtd></mtr></mtable></math>\n\n\nA change in spending of $100 multiplied by the spending multiplier of 2.13 is equal to a change in GDP of $213. Not coincidentally, this result is exactly what was calculated in [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_022) after many rounds of expenditures cycling through the economy.\n\nThe size of the multiplier is determined by what proportion of the marginal dollar of income goes into taxes, saving, and imports. These three factors are known as \u201cleakages,\u201d because they determine how much demand \u201cleaks out\u201d in each round of the multiplier effect. If the leakages are relatively small, then each successive round of the multiplier effect will have larger amounts of demand, and the multiplier will be high. Conversely, if the leakages are relatively large, then any initial change in demand will diminish more quickly in the second, third, and later rounds, and the multiplier will be small. Changes in the size of the leakages\u2014a change in the marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, or the marginal propensity to import\u2014will change the size of the multiplier.\n\n**Calculating Keynesian Policy Interventions**\n\nReturning to the original question: How much should government spending be increased to produce a total increase in real GDP of $100? If the goal is to increase aggregate demand by $100, and the multiplier is 2.13, then the increase in government spending to achieve that goal would be $100/2.13 = $47. Government spending of approximately $47, when combined with a multiplier of 2.13 (which is, remember, based on the specific assumptions about tax, saving, and import rates), produces an overall increase in real GDP of $100, restoring the economy to potential GDP of $800, as [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_023) shows.\n\n {: #CNX_Econ_C25_023 data-title=\"The Multiplier Effect in an Expenditure-Output Model \"}\n\nThe multiplier effect is also visible on the Keynesian cross diagram. [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_023) shows the example we have been discussing: a recessionary gap with an equilibrium of $700, potential GDP of $800, the slope of the aggregate expenditure function (AE<sub>0</sub>) determined by the assumptions that taxes are 30% of income, savings are 0.1 of after-tax income, and imports are 0.1 of before-tax income. At AE<sub>1</sub>, the aggregate expenditure function is moved up to reach potential GDP.\n\nNow, compare the vertical shift upward in the aggregate expenditure function, which is $47, with the horizontal shift outward in real GDP, which is $100 (as these numbers were calculated earlier). The rise in real GDP is more than double the rise in the aggregate expenditure function. (Similarly, if you look back at [\\[link\\]](#CNX_Econ_C25_026), you will see that the vertical movements in the aggregate expenditure functions are smaller than the change in equilibrium output that is produced on the horizontal axis. Again, this is the multiplier effect at work.) In this way, the power of the multiplier is apparent in the income\u2013expenditure graph, as well as in the arithmetic calculation.\n\nThe multiplier does not just affect government spending, but applies to any change in the economy. Say that business confidence declines and investment falls off, or that the economy of a leading trading partner slows down so that export sales decline. These changes will reduce aggregate expenditures, and then will have an even larger effect on real GDP because of the multiplier effect. Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn how the multiplier effect can be applied to analyze the economic impact of professional sports.\n\n\n\nHow can the multiplier be used to analyze the economic impact of professional sports?\n\nAttracting professional sports teams and building sports stadiums to create jobs and stimulate business growth is an economic development strategy adopted by many communities throughout the United States. In his recent article, \u201cPublic Financing of Private Sports Stadiums,\u201d James Joyner of *Outside the Beltway* looked at public financing for NFL teams. Joyner\u2019s findings confirm the earlier work of John Siegfried of Vanderbilt University and Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College.\n\nSiegfried and Zimbalist used the multiplier to analyze this issue. They considered the amount of taxes paid and dollars spent locally to see if there was a positive multiplier effect. Since most professional athletes and owners of sports teams are rich enough to owe a lot of taxes, let\u2019s say that 40% of any marginal income they earn is paid in taxes. Because athletes are often high earners with short careers, let\u2019s assume that they save one-third of their after-tax income.\n\nHowever, many professional athletes do not live year-round in the city in which they play, so let\u2019s say that one-half of the money that they do spend is spent outside the local area. One can think of spending outside a local economy, in this example, as the equivalent of imported goods for the national economy.\n\nNow, consider the impact of money spent at local entertainment venues other than professional sports. While the owners of these other businesses may be comfortably middle-income, few of them are in the economic stratosphere of professional athletes. Because their incomes are lower, so are their taxes; say that they pay only 35% of their marginal income in taxes. They do not have the same ability, or need, to save as much as professional athletes, so let\u2019s assume their MPC is just 0.8. Finally, because more of them live locally, they will spend a higher proportion of their income on local goods\u2014say, 65%.\n\nIf these general assumptions hold true, then money spent on professional sports will have less local economic impact than money spent on other forms of entertainment. For professional athletes, out of a dollar earned, 40 cents goes to taxes, leaving 60 cents. Of that 60 cents, one-third is saved, leaving 40 cents, and half is spent outside the area, leaving 20 cents. Only 20 cents of each dollar is cycled into the local economy in the first round. For locally-owned entertainment, out of a dollar earned, 35 cents goes to taxes, leaving 65 cents. Of the rest, 20% is saved, leaving 52 cents, and of that amount, 65% is spent in the local area, so that 33.8 cents of each dollar of income is recycled into the local economy.\n\nSiegfried and Zimbalist make the plausible argument that, within their household budgets, people have a fixed amount to spend on entertainment. If this assumption holds true, then money spent attending professional sports events is money that was not spent on other entertainment options in a given metropolitan area. Since the multiplier is lower for professional sports than for other local entertainment options, the arrival of professional sports to a city would reallocate entertainment spending in a way that causes the local economy to shrink, rather than to grow. Thus, their findings seem to confirm what Joyner reports and what newspapers across the country are reporting. A quick Internet search for \u201ceconomic impact of sports\u201d will yield numerous reports questioning this economic development strategy.\n\n\n\n**Multiplier Tradeoffs: Stability versus the Power of Macroeconomic Policy**\n\nIs an economy healthier with a high multiplier or a low one? With a high multiplier, any change in aggregate demand will tend to be substantially magnified, and so the economy will be more unstable. With a low multiplier, by contrast, changes in aggregate demand will not be multiplied much, so the economy will tend to be more stable.\n\nHowever, with a low multiplier, government policy changes in taxes or spending will tend to have less impact on the equilibrium level of real output. With a higher multiplier, government policies to raise or reduce aggregate expenditures will have a larger effect. Thus, a low multiplier means a more stable economy, but also weaker government macroeconomic policy, while a high multiplier means a more volatile economy, but also an economy in which government macroeconomic policy is more powerful.\n\n### Key Concepts and Summary\n\nThe expenditure-output model or Keynesian cross diagram shows how the level of aggregate expenditure (on the vertical axis) varies with the level of economic output (shown on the horizontal axis). Since the value of all macroeconomic output also represents income to someone somewhere else in the economy, the horizontal axis can also be interpreted as national income. The equilibrium in the diagram will occur where the aggregate expenditure line crosses the 45-degree line, which represents the set of points where aggregate expenditure in the economy is equal to output (or national income). Equilibrium in a Keynesian cross diagram can happen at potential GDP, or below or above that level.\n\nThe consumption function shows the upward-sloping relationship between national income and consumption. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the amount consumed out of an additional dollar of income. A higher marginal propensity to consume means a steeper consumption function; a lower marginal propensity to consume means a flatter consumption function. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the amount saved out of an additional dollar of income. It is necessarily true that MPC + MPS = 1. The investment function is drawn as a flat line, showing that investment in the current year does not change with regard to the current level of national income. However, the investment function will move up and down based on the expected rate of return in the future. Government spending is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because its level is determined by political considerations, not by the current level of income in the economy. Taxes in the basic Keynesian cross diagram are taken into account by adjusting the consumption function. The export function is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because exports do not change as a result of changes in domestic income, but they move as a result of changes in foreign income, as well as changes in exchange rates. The import function is drawn as a downward-sloping line, because imports rise with national income, but imports are a subtraction from aggregate demand. Thus, a higher level of imports means a lower level of expenditure on domestic goods.\n\nIn a Keynesian cross diagram, the equilibrium may be at a level below potential GDP, which is called a recessionary gap, or at a level above potential GDP, which is called an inflationary gap.\n\nThe multiplier effect describes how an initial change in aggregate demand generated several times as much as cumulative GDP. The size of the spending multiplier is determined by three leakages: spending on savings, taxes, and imports.

Use an MPC of 80% in an example.\n\n\n\n\n<span data-type=\"title\">Solution</span>The multiplier refers to how many times a dollar will turnover in the economy. It is based on the Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC) which tells how much of every dollar received will be spent. If the MPC is 80% then this means that out of every one dollar received by a consumer, $0.80 will be spent. This $0.80 is received by another person. In turn, 80% of the $0.80 received, or $0.64, will be spent, and so on. The impact of the multiplier is diluted when the effect of taxes and expenditure on imports is considered. To derive the multiplier, take the 1/1 \u2013 F; where F is equal to percent of savings, taxes, and expenditures on imports.\n\n### Review Questions\n\n\n\nWhat is on the axes of an expenditure-output diagram?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the 45-degree line show?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat determines the slope of a consumption function?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the marginal propensity to consume, and how is it related to the marginal propensity to import?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are the investment function, the government spending function, and the export function all drawn as flat lines?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does the import function slope down?
